Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)\n\nA) 2 880 000 km.\nB) 3 000 000 km.\nC) 2 940 000 km.\nD) 3 060 000 km.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\n*   **Frames of Reference:** We have two inertial frames: the \"stationary\" frame of the Galaxy (S) and the \"moving\" frame of the supernova ejecta (S').\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time in the moving frame (ejecta's frame): `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the **proper time**, often denoted as `Δt₀`.\n    *   Speed of light: `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n*   **Objective:** Find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n**2. Core Physical Principle**\n\nThe velocity of the ejecta is 20% of the speed of light (`v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`). At such high speeds, the effects of special relativity are measurable. The key principle is **time dilation**: a clock in a moving frame (S') appears to run slower when observed from a stationary frame (S).\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).**\n    The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt₀`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    Plugging in the values:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame (`d`).**\n    The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the same frame.\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    Substitute the expression for `Δt` from Step 1:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = 60,000 km/s * (1 / √0.96) * 50 s`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96 km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km`\n\n*   **Step 3: Compute the final value.**\n    `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**4. Analysis of Options and Careful Points**\n\n*   The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.\n*   Let's compare this to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n*   The calculated value is closest to **A) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n**Careful Points & Logical Check:**\n\n1.  **Non-Relativistic Error:** If we ignore relativity, the distance would be `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option B.\n2.  **Time Dilation Logic:** Because of time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) must be *longer* than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, the distance traveled (`d = v * Δt`) must be *greater* than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km.\n3.  **Elimination:** Based on the logical check, we can immediately eliminate options B, C, and D, as they are not greater than 3,000,000 km. This leaves only option A as the plausible answer, confirming our calculation.\n4.  **Candidate Answer Analysis:** All provided candidate answers correctly perform the calculation and arrive at a value near 3,061,862 km. Their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) vary because the option lists they reference are scrambled. However, the underlying physics and numerical result are unanimously correct.\n\nBased on the correct physical principles, calculation, and a logical check, the distance is slightly over 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires the application of the principle of time dilation from the theory of special relativity.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. It is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest within its own reference frame.\n    *   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the **Galaxy's reference frame**. Let's call this distance `d`. The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval for an event that takes a proper time (`Δt₀`) in a moving frame (the ejecta). This is called time dilation. The relationship is given by the formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance (d):**\n    We can combine the steps to find the distance `d` directly:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    `d = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n    `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √0.96`\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n\n    *   Calculating the final value:\n        `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. We compare this to the given options:\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\n    The calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to option D, 3,060,000 km.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Non-Relativistic Error:** A common mistake is to ignore relativity and simply calculate `distance = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option A and is incorrect because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%).\n*   **Logical Check:** Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) must be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, the distance traveled as measured in the Galaxy's frame (`v * Δt`) must be greater than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km. Of the choices provided, only option D (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km. This logical check confirms the result without needing a full calculation.\n*   **Correct Application of γ:** Another potential error is to multiply by `√(1 - v²/c²)` instead of dividing. This would incorrectly suggest time \"contraction\" and lead to a distance smaller than 3,000,000 km.\n\nThe physics and the calculation both point to the same answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a problem that requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference and Given Values:** We have two frames: the \"stationary\" Galaxy frame and the \"moving\" ejecta frame. We are given the relative velocity (`v`), the time elapsed in the moving frame (`Δt'`), and the speed of light (`c`).\n2.  **Apply Time Dilation:** The core of the problem is that time passes differently in the two frames. The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. We will use the time dilation formula to find `Δt`.\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** The time dilation formula requires the Lorentz factor, which depends on the ratio of the object's speed to the speed of light.\n4.  **Calculate Dilated Time:** We will use the Lorentz factor and the proper time (50 s) to find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n5.  **Calculate Distance:** The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n6.  **Compare and Conclude:** We will compare the calculated distance to the given options to find the closest match.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Proper Time:** The 50 seconds is the \"proper time\" (`Δt'`) because it's measured by a clock moving with the ejecta. A common error is to confuse proper time with the time measured by the stationary observer.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Contraction:** Time in the stationary frame is always *longer* than in the moving frame. Therefore, the calculated distance must be *greater* than the non-relativistic distance (`60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`). This immediately eliminates option A and makes option D the only plausible choice.\n*   **Formula Application:** The Lorentz factor `γ` is `1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`. A mistake would be to multiply by `sqrt(1 - v²/c²)` instead of dividing, which would lead to an incorrect smaller distance.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values\n# Velocity of the ejecta (v) in km/s\nv = 60000\n# Time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (proper time, t_prime) in seconds\nt_prime = 50\n# Speed of light (c) in km/s\nc = 300000\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# The formula is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\nbeta_squared = (v / c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (t_galaxy)\n# The formula for time dilation is t_galaxy = gamma * t_prime\nt_galaxy = gamma * t_prime\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\n# The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\ndistance_in_galaxy_frame = v * t_galaxy\n\n# Step 5: Print the results and compare with the options\nprint(f\"The calculated distance is: {distance_in_galaxy_frame:.0f} km\")\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 3000000,\n    \"B\": 2940000,\n    \"C\": 2880000,\n    \"D\": 3060000\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nfor choice, value in options.items():\n    print(f\"{choice}) {value:,} km\")\n\n# Find the closest option\nclosest_choice = min(options, key=lambda choice: abs(options[choice] - distance_in_galaxy_frame))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated distance of {distance_in_galaxy_frame:.0f} km is closest to option {closest_choice}.\")\nprint(f\"The final answer is {closest_choice}\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated distance is: 3061862 km\n\nComparing with the options:\nA) 3,000,000 km\nB) 2,940,000 km\nC) 2,880,000 km\nD) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of 3061862 km is closest to option D.\nThe final answer is D\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem involves an object (supernova ejecta) moving at a relativistic speed (60,000 km/s is 20% of the speed of light). Therefore, the principles of Special Relativity must be applied, not classical mechanics. The key concept is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Reference Frames:**\n    *   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we are asked to measure the distance.\n    *   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame.\n\n3.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time in the moving frame (proper time): `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the proper time because it's measured by a clock that is at rest relative to the event being measured (the passage of time for the ejecta).\n    *   Speed of light: `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Goal:** The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame. This distance (`d`) is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n5.  **Apply Time Dilation:** According to Special Relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for an event that takes proper time (`Δt₀`) in the moving frame (ejecta). The formula is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    *   **Calculate the ratio `v/c`:**\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   **Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:**\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n    *   **Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame `Δt`:**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    *   **Calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame:**\n        `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\n    To be more precise and avoid intermediate rounding:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) = 3,000,000 / √(0.96)`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to the value in option A, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is due to rounding in the option itself.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proper Time:** The most critical point is correctly identifying that the 50 seconds is the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's measured in the moving object's own frame.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Contraction:** Time in the stationary observer's frame is always *dilated* (longer) than the proper time. A common mistake is to reverse this, which would lead to a shorter time and a smaller distance.\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Answer:** A non-relativistic calculation (`d = v * t = 60,000 * 50`) gives `3,000,000 km` (Option C). Since time dilates, the time in the Galaxy frame is > 50s, so the distance must be > 3,000,000 km. This logical check immediately eliminates options B, C, and D, leaving only A as a possible answer.\n*   **Length Contraction Error:** Another potential error is to misapply the length contraction formula. This would involve multiplying by `√(1 - v²/c²)`, leading to `3,000,000 * √(0.96) ≈ 2,940,000 km` (Option D). This is incorrect.\n\nAll the provided candidate answers correctly identify the need for time dilation and arrive at the same numerical result, confirming the methodology. The only discrepancies are in the lettering of the final options, but the value is consistent. Based on the options provided in the question prompt, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires the application of the special theory of relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation. The velocity of the ejecta is a significant fraction of the speed of light, so classical mechanics (`distance = velocity × time`) will not give the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We want to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. It is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock at rest in its own frame.\n    *   **Speed of Light (`c`):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    An observer in the stationary Galaxy frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for the event than the 50 seconds measured in the moving ejecta frame (S'). This is time dilation. The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n\n    The relationship between the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and the proper time (`Δt₀`) is given by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (`γ`):**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Distance (`d`):**\n    We can combine the formulas to solve for the distance directly:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    `d = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n    `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(0.96)`\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)`\n\n    The code interpreter has already performed this calculation, yielding the result:\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated distance is **3,061,862 km**. We now compare this to the given options:\n    A) 2,940,000 km\n    B) 2,880,000 km\n    C) 3,060,000 km\n    D) 3,000,000 km\n\n    The calculated value of 3,061,862 km is undeniably closest to option C, 3,060,000 km.\n\n### Logical Check\n*   A non-relativistic (classical) calculation would give: `d = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This is option D.\n*   Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is *longer* than 50 seconds.\n*   Therefore, the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n*   Looking at the options, only option C (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km. This confirms our calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a problem in special relativity that requires the application of time dilation. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physics\nThe core of the problem lies in the fact that the supernova ejecta is moving at a relativistic speed (a significant fraction of the speed of light). This means that time and distance are relative and depend on the observer's frame of reference.\n\n*   **Frames of Reference:** We have two frames: the \"stationary\" frame of the Galaxy (S) and the \"moving\" frame of the ejecta (S').\n*   **Proper Time:** The time interval of 50 seconds is measured in the ejecta's frame (S'). This is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured by a clock that is at rest relative to the event being observed (the passage of its own time).\n*   **Time Dilation:** An observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for the same event. This is called time dilation.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame (S). This distance is the ejecta's velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step A: Define the known values.**\n*   Velocity of the ejecta, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Proper time in the ejecta's frame, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   Speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\nThe Lorentz factor determines the magnitude of the relativistic effect.\nThe formula is: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n1.  Calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n2.  Substitute this into the formula:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n3.  Calculate the value:\n    `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n**Step C: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\nThe time dilation formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n`Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n**Step D: Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame.**\nThe distance is `d = v * Δt`.\n`d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\nFor higher precision, we can perform the calculation without rounding the intermediate steps:\n`d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n`d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96)`\n`d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96)`\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### 3. Comparison with Options and Careful Points\n\n*   The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.\n*   Let's compare this to the given options:\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic:** A common mistake is to ignore relativity and calculate the distance as `d = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option B. Since time in the Galaxy's frame is dilated (longer), the distance must be greater than the classical result. This immediately eliminates options A, B, and D.\n2.  **Proper Time Identification:** It is crucial to identify the 50 seconds as the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's measured in the moving frame. If this were mistaken for the time in the stationary frame, the result would be incorrect.\n3.  **Correct Application of Lorentz Factor:** The time in the stationary frame is *longer*, so you must multiply the proper time by `γ` (which is > 1). Incorrectly dividing by `γ` would lead to a shorter time and a distance less than 3,000,000 km.\n4.  **Rounding:** The provided options are rounded. The calculated value of ~3,061,862 km is extremely close to 3,060,000 km, indicating that C is the intended answer.\n\nAll the provided candidate answers that correctly apply the physics arrive at the same numerical result. The final choice of C is based on comparing this result to the specific options given in the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires the application of the principle of time dilation from the theory of special relativity. The core task is to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy. We need to find the distance traveled (`d`) in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. It is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest relative to the event being measured.\n    *   **Speed of Light (`c`):** Approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    An observer in the stationary Galaxy frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for an event that takes `Δt₀` in the moving ejecta frame (S'). This is time dilation. The distance in the Galaxy frame is `d = v * Δt`. To find this, we first need to calculate `Δt`.\n\n    The time dilation formula is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (`β`):\n        `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, substitute this into the formula for γ:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Distance (`d`):**\n    We can combine the steps to calculate the distance directly, which avoids rounding errors:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    `d = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n    `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(0.96)`\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)`\n\n    *   Calculating the final value:\n        `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\n    The calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proper Time:** The most common mistake is misidentifying the proper time. The 50 seconds is measured on the ejecta's clock, making it the proper time (`Δt₀`).\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Contraction:** Time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is always *longer* than the proper time (`Δt₀`). Therefore, the calculated distance must be *greater* than the non-relativistic distance.\n*   **Non-Relativistic Error:** A simple, incorrect calculation would be `d = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This is option (B) and ignores the significant relativistic effects. Since time dilates, the distance must be greater than this value, immediately pointing towards option (D) as the only plausible answer.\n*   **Incorrect Formula Application:** Another error would be to multiply by `√(1 - v²/c²)` instead of dividing. This would result in `3,000,000 km * √0.96 ≈ 2,939,388 km`, which is close to option (C) and is incorrect.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while they all correctly perform the calculation, there is widespread confusion in mapping the final numerical answer to the correct letter (A, B, C, or D) due to inconsistent option lists. However, the physics and the resulting number are consistent across all correct analyses. The calculated distance is ~3,061,862 km, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires the application of the special theory of relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation, because the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We want to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. It is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest relative to the event being measured.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. The Physical Principle: Time Dilation**\nFrom the perspective of an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame, time for the moving ejecta will appear to pass more slowly. This means that the 50 seconds that pass for the ejecta correspond to a longer duration in the Galaxy's frame. The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity multiplied by this longer, dilated time.\n\n**3. The Calculation**\nThe distance (`d`) in the Galaxy's frame is given by `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the time in the two frames and is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, substitute this into the formula for γ:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the dilated time (Δt) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    The time dilation formula is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    `Δt = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    Substitute the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula:\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\n    Now, we compute the final numerical value:\n    `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**4. Compare with the Options and Conclude**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. We compare this to the given options:\n*   A) 2,940,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,060,000 km\n*   D) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n**Careful Points and Common Errors:**\n*   **Non-Relativistic Calculation:** Simply multiplying velocity by the given time (`60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`) ignores relativistic effects and leads to the incorrect answer D.\n*   **Incorrect Time Dilation:** Incorrectly dividing by the Lorentz factor instead of multiplying would result in a shorter time and a distance less than 3,000,000 km, leading to an answer near 2,940,000 km (Option A). This is physically incorrect as time in the stationary frame must be longer.\n*   **Logical Check:** Since time is dilated (passes for longer) in the Galaxy's frame, the distance traveled must be greater than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km. Only option C (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km, confirming it as the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Core Physics Principle**\n\nThe problem involves an object (the supernova ejecta) moving at a very high velocity (`v = 60,000 km/s`). This speed is 20% of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`), which is a significant fraction. Therefore, the effects described by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity must be taken into account. The key principle here is **time dilation**.\n\n**2. Define the Frames of Reference**\n\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We need to calculate the distance traveled from this perspective.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. The time interval of 50 seconds is measured in this frame.\n\n**3. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   Relative velocity: `v = 60,000 km/s`\n*   Proper time (time in the moving frame): `Δt₀ = 50 s`\n*   Speed of light: `c = 300,000 km/s`\n\n**4. The Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame. The formula for this distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time interval as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**5. Apply Time Dilation**\n\nAccording to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for an event that takes a proper time (`Δt₀`) in the moving frame (the ejecta). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**6. Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    We can combine the formulas to solve for the distance directly:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    `d = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n    `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √0.96`\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n\n*   **Step C: Compute the final value.**\n    `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**7. Compare with the Options and Conclude**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. We now compare this to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) 2,940,000 km. (Incorrect; this would result from incorrectly multiplying by `√0.96`)\n*   B) 2,880,000 km. (Incorrect)\n*   C) 3,060,000 km. (This is the closest value to our calculated result)\n*   D) 3,000,000 km. (Incorrect; this is the non-relativistic answer, ignoring time dilation)\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is extremely close to 3,060,000 km. The small difference is due to rounding in the option choices. Therefore, this is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the distance the supernova ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n*   **Given Data:**\n    *   Relative velocity `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (the moving frame) `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light `c` is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n*   **Physical Principle:** The velocity is 20% of the speed of light (`v = 0.2c`), which is significant enough to require the use of Einstein's special theory of relativity. The key concept is **time dilation**.\n\n**2. Core Concept: Time Dilation**\n\nAn observer in a stationary reference frame (the Galaxy) will perceive time as passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This means the 50 seconds that pass on the ejecta's clock will correspond to a longer time interval in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n*   The time measured in the moving frame (`Δt' = 50 s`) is called the **proper time**.\n*   The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is calculated using the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**3.

Analysis of Options and Common Pitfalls**\n\n*   **Calculated Answer:** `~3,061,862 km`.\n*   **Provided Options:**\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km\n\n*   **Comparison:** The calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is closest to **A) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n*   **Pitfall 1 (Ignoring Relativity):** Simply multiplying velocity by the given time (`60,000 km/s * 50 s`) gives `3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option D and is incorrect.\n*   **Pitfall 2 (Incorrectly Applying Lorentz Factor):** If one were to mistakenly multiply by `√(1 - v²/c²)` instead of dividing, the result would be `3,000,000 * √0.96 ≈ 2,939,388 km`. This is close to option C and is also incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct physical principle is time dilation. The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds, so the distance traveled must be greater than the non-relativistic calculation of 3,000,000 km. The precise calculation yields approximately 3,061,862 km, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

The high velocity (`v = 60,000 km/s`, which is 20% of the speed of light) necessitates the use of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Physical Principle:** The key principle is **time dilation**. The time elapsed in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is longer than the proper time measured in the moving frame (`Δt'`). The relationship is `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculation Formula:** The distance in the Galaxy's frame (`d`) is its velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   Substituting the time dilation formula: `d = v * (γ * Δt')`\n    *   Substituting the Lorentz factor formula `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`:\n        `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  **Execution and Result:** The Python code correctly implemented this formula:\n    *   `v = 60000` km/s\n    *   `Δt' = 50` s\n    *   `c = 300000` km/s\n    *   The calculation `(60000 * 50) / sqrt(1 - (60000/300000)**2)` yielded the result `3,061,862.18 km`.\n\n5.  **Comparison with Options:**\n    *   Calculated distance: `3,061,862.18 km`\n    *   Option A: `3,060,000 km`\n    *   Option B: `2,880,000 km`\n    *   Option C: `2,940,000 km`\n    *   Option D: `3,000,000 km`\n\n    The calculated value is closest to Option A. The difference of approximately 1,862 km (or about 0.06%) is negligible and due to the rounding of the option value.\n\n6.  **Logical Verification:**\n    *   A non-relativistic calculation (ignoring time dilation) would give `d = v * Δt' = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km` (Option D).\n    *   Because of time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is *longer* than 50 seconds.\n    *   Therefore, the distance traveled must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km.\n    *   Only Option A (`3,060,000 km`) is greater than 3,000,000 km.

Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n*   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (`β`):\n    `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n*   Now, calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n**5. Calculate the Distance**\nWe can now substitute the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula:\n`d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n`d = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n`d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n`d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √0.96`\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**6.

This corresponds to option D.\n*   **Logical Deduction:** Due to time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) must be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, the distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy (`d = v * Δt`) must be greater than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km. Of the options provided, only C (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km. This logical check confirms our calculation.\n*   **Candidate Answer Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly identify the physics and perform the calculation to get a result of ~3,062,000 km.

It is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest in its own reference frame.\n    *   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the **Galaxy's reference frame**. To find this distance (`d`), we must use the velocity (`v`) and the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`). The formula is `d = v * Δt`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    An observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for the moving ejecta. Consequently, the time interval measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the proper time (`Δt₀`). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, substitute this into the formula for γ:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame:**\n    We can combine the formulas to solve for the distance `d` directly:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    `d = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n    Substituting the values:\n    `d = 60,000 km/s * (1 / √0.96) * 50 s`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96 km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km`\n    Calculating the final value:\n    `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical:** A non-relativistic calculation would simply be `distance = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option B). Because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%), this classical approach is incorrect.\n*   **Logical Check:** Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, the distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy must be greater than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km. This logical check immediately eliminates options A, B, and D.\n*   **Final Comparison:** The calculated distance of approximately `3,061,862 km` is closest to option C, `3,060,000 km`.

This is time dilation. The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    *   First, we need to find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`. The formula for time dilation is:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n        where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   Combining these, the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame is:\n        `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Calculate the non-relativistic distance (the numerator):\n        `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`.\n    *   Calculate the denominator `√(1 - v²/c²)`:\n        `√(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n    *   `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`.\n    *   Calculate the final distance `d`:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.

This corresponds to option B and is incorrect.\n*   **Incorrect Time Dilation:** A conceptual error would be to think time in the moving frame is longer, which would lead to multiplying by `√0.96` instead of dividing. This would give `3,000,000 km * √0.96 ≈ 2,940,000 km`, corresponding to option D. This is incorrect because time in the stationary frame is always measured to be longer.\n*   **Logical Check:** Since time is dilated (runs slower) for the ejecta from the Galaxy's perspective, more than 50 seconds must have passed in the Galaxy's frame. Therefore, the distance traveled must be greater than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The supernova ejecta is moving at a velocity of 60,000 km/s. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. The ejecta's speed is therefore `60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2` times the speed of light (20% of c). At such high speeds, the effects of special relativity are significant and must be accounted for. The key principle to apply is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. The 50-second time interval is measured in this frame.\n\n3.  **Identify Given Information and the Goal:**\n    *   Relative velocity: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time in the moving frame (proper time): `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock that is at rest within its own reference frame.\n    *   Goal: Calculate the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's frame. The formula is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Time Dilation Formula:**\n    According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for an event that takes a proper time (`Δt₀`) in the moving frame. The relationship is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, substitute this into the formula for `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance (`d`):**\n    We can combine the formulas to solve for the distance directly, which avoids intermediate rounding errors:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √0.96`\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n    *   Calculating the final value:\n        `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.

This would give `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option B. This is incorrect because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n*   **Proper Time Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify that the 50 seconds is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the moving frame of the ejecta.\n*   **Correct Application of the Lorentz Factor:** Time in the stationary frame is always *dilated* (longer) than the proper time. Therefore, one must multiply the proper time by `γ` (which is greater than 1). A common error is to invert the factor (i.e., multiply by `1/γ`), which would imply time \"contraction\" and lead to an incorrect answer of `3,000,000 * √0.96 ≈ 2,939,388 km`, which is close to option C.\n*   **Logical Check:** Because of time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame must be *longer* than 50 seconds. Therefore, the distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km. Looking at the options, only D (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km.

This corresponds to option B.\n2.  **Time Dilation Logic:** Because of time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) must be *longer* than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame.

Let's call this distance `d`. The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval for an event that takes a proper time (`Δt₀`) in a moving frame (the ejecta). This is called time dilation.

This corresponds to option A and is incorrect because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%).\n*   **Logical Check:** Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) must be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, the distance traveled as measured in the Galaxy's frame (`v * Δt`) must be greater than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km. Of the choices provided, only option D (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km.

Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference and Given Values:** We have two frames: the \"stationary\" Galaxy frame and the \"moving\" ejecta frame. We are given the relative velocity (`v`), the time elapsed in the moving frame (`Δt'`), and the speed of light (`c`).\n2.  **Apply Time Dilation:** The core of the problem is that time passes differently in the two frames. The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. We will use the time dilation formula to find `Δt`.\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** The time dilation formula requires the Lorentz factor, which depends on the ratio of the object's speed to the speed of light.\n4.  **Calculate Dilated Time:** We will use the Lorentz factor and the proper time (50 s) to find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n5.  **Calculate Distance:** The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n6.  **Compare and Conclude:** We will compare the calculated distance to the given options to find the closest match.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Proper Time:** The 50 seconds is the \"proper time\" (`Δt'`) because it's measured by a clock moving with the ejecta. A common error is to confuse proper time with the time measured by the stationary observer.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Contraction:** Time in the stationary frame is always *longer* than in the moving frame. Therefore, the calculated distance must be *greater* than the non-relativistic distance (`60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`). This immediately eliminates option A and makes option D the only plausible choice.\n*   **Formula Application:** The Lorentz factor `γ` is `1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.

Therefore, the principles of Special Relativity must be applied, not classical mechanics. The key concept is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Reference Frames:**\n    *   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we are asked to measure the distance.\n    *   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame.\n\n3.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time in the moving frame (proper time): `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the proper time because it's measured by a clock that is at rest relative to the event being measured (the passage of time for the ejecta).\n    *   Speed of light: `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Goal:** The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame. This distance (`d`) is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n5.  **Apply Time Dilation:** According to Special Relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for an event that takes proper time (`Δt₀`) in the moving frame (ejecta). The formula is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    *   **Calculate the ratio `v/c`:**\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   **Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:**\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n    *   **Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame `Δt`:**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    *   **Calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame:**\n        `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\n    To be more precise and avoid intermediate rounding:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) = 3,000,000 / √(0.96)`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to the value in option A, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is due to rounding in the option itself.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proper Time:** The most critical point is correctly identifying that the 50 seconds is the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's measured in the moving object's own frame.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Contraction:** Time in the stationary observer's frame is always *dilated* (longer) than the proper time. A common mistake is to reverse this, which would lead to a shorter time and a smaller distance.\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Answer:** A non-relativistic calculation (`d = v * t = 60,000 * 50`) gives `3,000,000 km` (Option C). Since time dilates, the time in the Galaxy frame is > 50s, so the distance must be > 3,000,000 km. This logical check immediately eliminates options B, C, and D, leaving only A as a possible answer.\n*   **Length Contraction Error:** Another potential error is to misapply the length contraction formula. This would involve multiplying by `√(1 - v²/c²)`, leading to `3,000,000 * √(0.96) ≈ 2,940,000 km` (Option D). This is incorrect.\n\nAll the provided candidate answers correctly identify the need for time dilation and arrive at the same numerical result, confirming the methodology. The only discrepancies are in the lettering of the final options, but the value is consistent. Based on the options provided in the question prompt, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires the application of the special theory of relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation. The velocity of the ejecta is a significant fraction of the speed of light, so classical mechanics (`distance = velocity × time`) will not give the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We want to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. It is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock at rest in its own frame.\n    *   **Speed of Light (`c`):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    An observer in the stationary Galaxy frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for the event than the 50 seconds measured in the moving ejecta frame (S'). This is time dilation. The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n\n    The relationship between the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and the proper time (`Δt₀`) is given by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (`γ`):**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Distance (`d`):**\n    We can combine the formulas to solve for the distance directly:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    `d = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n    `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(0.96)`\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)`\n\n    The code interpreter has already performed this calculation, yielding the result:\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated distance is **3,061,862 km**. We now compare this to the given options:\n    A) 2,940,000 km\n    B) 2,880,000 km\n    C) 3,060,000 km\n    D) 3,000,000 km\n\n    The calculated value of 3,061,862 km is undeniably closest to option C, 3,060,000 km.\n\n### Logical Check\n*   A non-relativistic (classical) calculation would give: `d = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This is option D.\n*   Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is *longer* than 50 seconds.\n*   Therefore, the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n*   Looking at the options, only option C (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km. This confirms our calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a problem in special relativity that requires the application of time dilation. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physics\nThe core of the problem lies in the fact that the supernova ejecta is moving at a relativistic speed (a significant fraction of the speed of light). This means that time and distance are relative and depend on the observer's frame of reference.\n\n*   **Frames of Reference:** We have two frames: the \"stationary\" frame of the Galaxy (S) and the \"moving\" frame of the ejecta (S').\n*   **Proper Time:** The time interval of 50 seconds is measured in the ejecta's frame (S'). This is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured by a clock that is at rest relative to the event being observed (the passage of its own time).\n*   **Time Dilation:** An observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for the same event. This is called time dilation.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame (S). This distance is the ejecta's velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step A: Define the known values.**\n*   Velocity of the ejecta, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Proper time in the ejecta's frame, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   Speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\nThe Lorentz factor determines the magnitude of the relativistic effect.\nThe formula is: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n1.  Calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n2.  Substitute this into the formula:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n3.  Calculate the value:\n    `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n**Step C: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\nThe time dilation formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n`Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n**Step D: Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame.**\nThe distance is `d = v * Δt`.\n`d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\nFor higher precision, we can perform the calculation without rounding the intermediate steps:\n`d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n`d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96)`\n`d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96)`\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### 3. Comparison with Options and Careful Points\n\n*   The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.\n*   Let's compare this to the given options:\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic:** A common mistake is to ignore relativity and calculate the distance as `d = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option B. Since time in the Galaxy's frame is dilated (longer), the distance must be greater than the classical result. This immediately eliminates options A, B, and D.\n2.  **Proper Time Identification:** It is crucial to identify the 50 seconds as the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's measured in the moving frame. If this were mistaken for the time in the stationary frame, the result would be incorrect.\n3.  **Correct Application of Lorentz Factor:** The time in the stationary frame is *longer*, so you must multiply the proper time by `γ` (which is > 1). Incorrectly dividing by `γ` would lead to a shorter time and a distance less than 3,000,000 km.\n4.  **Rounding:** The provided options are rounded. The calculated value of ~3,061,862 km is extremely close to 3,060,000 km, indicating that C is the intended answer.\n\nAll the provided candidate answers that correctly apply the physics arrive at the same numerical result. The final choice of C is based on comparing this result to the specific options given in the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires the application of the principle of time dilation from the theory of special relativity. The core task is to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy. We need to find the distance traveled (`d`) in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. It is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest relative to the event being measured.\n    *   **Speed of Light (`c`):** Approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    An observer in the stationary Galaxy frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for an event that takes `Δt₀` in the moving ejecta frame (S'). This is time dilation. The distance in the Galaxy frame is `d = v * Δt`. To find this, we first need to calculate `Δt`.\n\n    The time dilation formula is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (`β`):\n        `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, substitute this into the formula for γ:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Distance (`d`):**\n    We can combine the steps to calculate the distance directly, which avoids rounding errors:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    `d = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n    `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(0.96)`\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)`\n\n    *   Calculating the final value:\n        `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\n    The calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proper Time:** The most common mistake is misidentifying the proper time. The 50 seconds is measured on the ejecta's clock, making it the proper time (`Δt₀`).\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Contraction:** Time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is always *longer* than the proper time (`Δt₀`). Therefore, the calculated distance must be *greater* than the non-relativistic distance.\n*   **Non-Relativistic Error:** A simple, incorrect calculation would be `d = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This is option (B) and ignores the significant relativistic effects. Since time dilates, the distance must be greater than this value, immediately pointing towards option (D) as the only plausible answer.\n*   **Incorrect Formula Application:** Another error would be to multiply by `√(1 - v²/c²)` instead of dividing. This would result in `3,000,000 km * √0.96 ≈ 2,939,388 km`, which is close to option (C) and is incorrect.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while they all correctly perform the calculation, there is widespread confusion in mapping the final numerical answer to the correct letter (A, B, C, or D) due to inconsistent option lists. However, the physics and the resulting number are consistent across all correct analyses. The calculated distance is ~3,061,862 km, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires the application of the special theory of relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation, because the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

It is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest relative to the event being measured.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. The Physical Principle: Time Dilation**\nFrom the perspective of an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame, time for the moving ejecta will appear to pass more slowly. This means that the 50 seconds that pass for the ejecta correspond to a longer duration in the Galaxy's frame. The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity multiplied by this longer, dilated time.\n\n**3. The Calculation**\nThe distance (`d`) in the Galaxy's frame is given by `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the time in the two frames and is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, substitute this into the formula for γ:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the dilated time (Δt) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    The time dilation formula is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    `Δt = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    Substitute the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula:\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\n    Now, we compute the final numerical value:\n    `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**4.

This is physically incorrect as time in the stationary frame must be longer.\n*   **Logical Check:** Since time is dilated (passes for longer) in the Galaxy's frame, the distance traveled must be greater than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km.

Identify the Core Physics Principle**\n\nThe problem involves an object (the supernova ejecta) moving at a very high velocity (`v = 60,000 km/s`). This speed is 20% of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`), which is a significant fraction. Therefore, the effects described by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity must be taken into account. The key principle here is **time dilation**.\n\n**2.

Apply Time Dilation**\n\nAccording to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for an event that takes a proper time (`Δt₀`) in the moving frame (the ejecta). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**6. Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    We can combine the formulas to solve for the distance directly:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    `d = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n    `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √0.96`\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n\n*   **Step C: Compute the final value.**\n    `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**7.

Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the distance the supernova ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n*   **Given Data:**\n    *   Relative velocity `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (the moving frame) `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light `c` is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n*   **Physical Principle:** The velocity is 20% of the speed of light (`v = 0.2c`), which is significant enough to require the use of Einstein's special theory of relativity. The key concept is **time dilation**.\n\n**2. Core Concept: Time Dilation**\n\nAn observer in a stationary reference frame (the Galaxy) will perceive time as passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This means the 50 seconds that pass on the ejecta's clock will correspond to a longer time interval in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n*   The time measured in the moving frame (`Δt' = 50 s`) is called the **proper time**.\n*   The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is calculated using the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    The formula is `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n        `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\n    The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time measured in the same frame.\n    *   `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n    To avoid rounding errors, we can combine the steps:\n    *   `d = v * (γ * Δt') = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96 = 3,000,000 / √0.96`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**4. Analysis of Options and Common Pitfalls**\n\n*   **Calculated Answer:** `~3,061,862 km`.\n*   **Provided Options:**\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km\n\n*   **Comparison:** The calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is closest to **A) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n*   **Pitfall 1 (Ignoring Relativity):** Simply multiplying velocity by the given time (`60,000 km/s * 50 s`) gives `3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option D and is incorrect.\n*   **Pitfall 2 (Incorrectly Applying Lorentz Factor):** If one were to mistakenly multiply by `√(1 - v²/c²)` instead of dividing, the result would be `3,000,000 * √0.96 ≈ 2,939,388 km`. This is close to option C and is also incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct physical principle is time dilation. The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds, so the distance traveled must be greater than the non-relativistic calculation of 3,000,000 km. The precise calculation yields approximately 3,061,862 km, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

The specific concept needed is **time dilation**.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the Proper Time.**\n    The time measured in the reference frame that is moving with the clock is called the \"proper time\" (`Δt'`). In this case, the 50 seconds are measured in the ejecta's frame, so `Δt' = 50 s`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Apply the Time Dilation Formula.**\n    An observer in the \"stationary\" Galaxy frame will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for the event. The relationship between the two time intervals is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ).**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, substitute this into the formula for `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame.**\n    The distance (`d`) measured in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    Substitute the expression for `Δt` from Step 2:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt')`\n    Now, substitute the full expression for `γ` from Step 3:\n    `d = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt'`\n    Rearranging for easier calculation:\n    `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(0.96)`\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step 5: Compute the Final Value.**\n    I will use the code interpreter for a precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Non-relativistic distance\nd_non_relativistic = 3000000\n\n# Denominator for Lorentz factor\ndenominator = math.sqrt(0.96)\n\n# Relativistic distance\nd_relativistic = d_non_relativistic / denominator\n\nprint(d_relativistic)\n```\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.\n\n**3.

The minor difference is due to the rounding of the option value.\n\n*   **Crucial Point 1 (Logical Check):** A non-relativistic calculation would simply be `d = v * t = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km` (Option D). Due to time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame must be *longer* than 50 seconds. Therefore, the distance traveled must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km. Only option B satisfies this condition, making it the only plausible answer even without a full calculation.\n\n*   **Crucial Point 2 (Common Error):** A common mistake is to invert the Lorentz factor, which would lead to a calculated distance of `3,000,000 * √(0.96) ≈ 2,939,388 km`, which is close to option A. This is incorrect as it implies time \"contraction\" instead of dilation.\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct reasoning of the candidate answers, the precise calculation, and the logical check, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: 3061862.178478973\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n### **Final Analysis and Conclusion**\n\n1.  **Problem Deconstruction:** The core of the problem is to calculate a distance in one reference frame (the Galaxy's) based on a time measurement in another, moving reference frame (the ejecta's). The high velocity (`v = 60,000 km/s`, which is 20% of the speed of light) necessitates the use of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Physical Principle:** The key principle is **time dilation**. The time elapsed in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is longer than the proper time measured in the moving frame (`Δt'`). The relationship is `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculation Formula:** The distance in the Galaxy's frame (`d`) is its velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   Substituting the time dilation formula: `d = v * (γ * Δt')`\n    *   Substituting the Lorentz factor formula `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`:\n        `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  **Execution and Result:** The Python code correctly implemented this formula:\n    *   `v = 60000` km/s\n    *   `Δt' = 50` s\n    *   `c = 300000` km/s\n    *   The calculation `(60000 * 50) / sqrt(1 - (60000/300000)**2)` yielded the result `3,061,862.18 km`.\n\n5.  **Comparison with Options:**\n    *   Calculated distance: `3,061,862.18 km`\n    *   Option A: `3,060,000 km`\n    *   Option B: `2,880,000 km`\n    *   Option C: `2,940,000 km`\n    *   Option D: `3,000,000 km`\n\n    The calculated value is closest to Option A. The difference of approximately 1,862 km (or about 0.06%) is negligible and due to the rounding of the option value.\n\n6.  **Logical Verification:**\n    *   A non-relativistic calculation (ignoring time dilation) would give `d = v * Δt' = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km` (Option D).\n    *   Because of time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is *longer* than 50 seconds.\n    *   Therefore, the distance traveled must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km.\n    *   Only Option A (`3,060,000 km`) is greater than 3,000,000 km. This confirms that A is the only plausible answer.\n\nThe calculation is correct, and the result aligns with the closest available option.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires the application of the theory of special relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation, because the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

This corresponds to option D.\n*   **Logical Deduction:** Due to time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) must be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame.
