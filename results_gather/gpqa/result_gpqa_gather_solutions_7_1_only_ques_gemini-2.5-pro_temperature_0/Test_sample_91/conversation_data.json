Determine the Molecular Formula and Count the Bonds**\n\nFirst, we must correctly interpret the chemical formula to find the number of atoms and the types of bonds.\nThe molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** There are 12 carbon atoms (2+1+1+2+1+1+2).\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** There are 22 hydrogen atoms (6+1+2+4+2+1+6).\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure explicitly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds. There are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic molecule with 12 carbon atoms, there are a total of 11 bonds in the carbon skeleton (N-1). Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g).\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the reactants is the energy required to convert them into gaseous atoms: 12 C(g) + 22 H(g).\n\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon:\n    12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H2 gas (breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds):\n    11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product**\n\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product, C12H22. It is the sum of all bond energies.\n\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Total enthalpy of atomization of the product** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* This value (11200 kJ/mol) matches option C. This is a common distractor; it represents the energy to break the molecule apart, not its enthalpy of formation.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when the product is formed (which is equal to the product's enthalpy of atomization).\n\nΔHf° = [Σ ΔH_atom(reactants)] - [Σ ΔH_atom(product)]\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* The numerical value 1900 matches option D, but the units are incorrect (kJ/g vs. kJ/mol). This is another common distractor.\n\n**5. Convert Units to Match the Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. We must convert this to kJ/g to compare it with option B.\n\n*   **Calculate the Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    Molar Mass (M) = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert ΔHf° to kJ/g:**\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = ΔHf° (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value, when rounded to two decimal places, is 11.45 kJ/g, which is a match for option B (11.44 kJ/g). The minor difference is due to rounding in the problem's options or data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.\n*   The enthalpy of atomization of the compound is 11200 kJ/mol (Option C, a distractor).\n*   Converting the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g gives 11.44 kJ/g.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\nFirst, we must correctly identify the number of atoms and bonds in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbon (C): There are 12 carbon atoms.\n    *   Hydrogen (H): There are 22 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms gives the number of C-H bonds, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly indicates two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2** C=C bonds.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For a non-cyclic molecule, the total number of bonds in the carbon backbone is the number of carbon atoms minus one (12 - 1 = 11). Since two of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound into gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all bond energies.\n\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   **Total Bond Energy (Enthalpy of Atomization of Product)** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n*Careful Point:* This value, 11200 kJ/mol, matches option A. This is a common distractor, as it represents the energy to break the molecule apart, not its enthalpy of formation from elements.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements in their standard states into gaseous atoms. The formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g).\n\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon (C(s) → C(g)) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of Hydrogen (11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when the product is formed from its atoms (which is the total bond energy of the product).\n\n*   ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants) - (Enthalpy of Atomization of Product)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n*Careful Point:* This value, 1900, appears in option D, but with the wrong units (kJ/g). This is another distractor.\n\n**5. Convert Units to Match the Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. We must convert this to kJ/g to compare it with option C.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert to kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value, when rounded to two decimal places, is 11.45 kJ/g, which closely matches option C.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Option A (11200 kJ/mol) is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its formation.\n*   Option B (67.4 kJ/mol) is incorrect.\n*   Option C (11.44 kJ/g) matches our calculated value after unit conversion.\n*   Option D (1900 kJ/g) has the correct numerical value for the molar enthalpy of formation, but incorrect units.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to systematically calculate the enthalpy of formation for the given compound by following these steps. I will verify the calculations performed by the other agents and address the inconsistencies in their final choices, which seem to stem from misinterpreting the option letters.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecule**: First, I will determine the molecular formula of `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2` by counting the carbon and hydrogen atoms. Then, I will count the number of each type of bond (C-H, C-C, and C=C).\n2.  **Calculate Reactant Atomization Enthalpy**: I will calculate the total energy required to convert the constituent elements in their standard states (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of H₂ gas) into individual gaseous atoms.\n3.  **Calculate Product Atomization Enthalpy**: I will calculate the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule. This is the sum of all bond energies in the compound.\n4.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Formation (in kJ/mol)**: The enthalpy of formation is the difference between the reactant atomization enthalpy and the product atomization enthalpy.\n5.  **Convert to kJ/g**: Since some options are in kJ/g, I will calculate the molar mass of the compound and convert the enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g.\n6.  **Select the Final Answer**: I will compare my calculated result with the original options provided in the prompt to determine the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_enthalpy_formation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the enthalpy of formation for the given compound and determines the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze the Molecule and Define Given Data ---\n    # Molecular formula for (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 is C12H22.\n    num_C = 12\n    num_H = 22\n    \n    # Bond counts\n    num_CH_bonds = 22\n    num_CeqC_bonds = 2\n    # For an acyclic molecule, total C-C links = num_C -

There are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic molecule with 'n' carbon atoms, there are a total of n-1 bonds in the carbon skeleton. Here, n=12, so there are 11 total bonds between carbon atoms. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. It is the sum of all the bond energies.\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 × BE(C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 × BE(C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 × BE(C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the compound = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* This value matches option A, but it is the enthalpy of atomization, not the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactant Elements**\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g).\nWe need to calculate the energy required to convert the reactants into gaseous atoms: 12 C(g) + 22 H(g).\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon = 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H2 gas = 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   Total Enthalpy of Atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when the product is formed from its gaseous atoms (which is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound).\n*   ΔHf° = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* This value appears in option B, but the units are kJ/g, which is incorrect for this value.\n\n**Step 5: Convert Units to Match the Options**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.

Since 2 are double bonds, 11 - 2 = 9 single bonds).\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Sum of Bond Energies of the Compound (Product)**\n    This is the energy required to break one mole of the compound into gaseous atoms.\n    *   Energy from C-H bonds: 22 mol × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n    *   Energy from C-C bonds: 9 mol × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n    *   Energy from C=C bonds: 2 mol × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n    *   **Total Bond Energy = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the Sum of Enthalpies of Atomization of the Elements (Reactants)**\n    The formation reaction is `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)`.

Option C has the correct number but the wrong units. Option D is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, a common distractor. We must convert our result to kJ/g to check option B.\n\n    *   **Molar Mass of C12H22**: (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 166 g/mol.\n    *   **ΔHf° in kJ/g**: (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4458 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option B (11.44 kJ/g).

Since two of these are double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nThis initial analysis is performed correctly by nearly all agents.\n\n**Step B: Calculate Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\nWe need to calculate the energy required to turn the reactants into gaseous atoms: 12 C(g) + 22 H(g).\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\nThis step is also calculated correctly across all detailed answers.\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Sum of Bond Energies of the Product**\nThis is the energy required to atomize one mole of the product, C12H22.\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Total Bond Energy of Product = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\nThis value is also consistently and correctly calculated. It is important to note that this value matches option B, making it a common distractor.\n\n**Step D: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\nNow we apply the main formula:\n*   ΔHf° = [Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\nThis result is also consistently reached. Note that the numerical value `1900` matches option C, which has units of kJ/g, making it another distractor.\n\n**Step E: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. The options are in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. We must convert our result to kJ/g to make a final decision.\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **ΔHf° in kJ/g:** (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives **11.45 kJ/g**. This value corresponds to option D.\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and consistently yields a result of approximately 11.44 kJ/g.

Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound into gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all bond energies.\n\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   **Total Bond Energy (Enthalpy of Atomization of Product)** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n*Careful Point:* This value, 11200 kJ/mol, matches option A. This is a common distractor, as it represents the energy to break the molecule apart, not its enthalpy of formation from elements.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements in their standard states into gaseous atoms. The formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g).\n\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon (C(s) → C(g)) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of Hydrogen (11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when the product is formed from its atoms (which is the total bond energy of the product).\n\n*   ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants) - (Enthalpy of Atomization of Product)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n*Careful Point:* This value, 1900, appears in option D, but with the wrong units (kJ/g). This is another distractor.\n\n**5. Convert Units to Match the Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. We must convert this to kJ/g to compare it with option C.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert to kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value, when rounded to two decimal places, is 11.45 kJ/g, which closely matches option C.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Option A (11200 kJ/mol) is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its formation.\n*   Option B (67.4 kJ/mol) is incorrect.\n*   Option C (11.44 kJ/g) matches our calculated value after unit conversion.\n*   Option D (1900 kJ/g) has the correct numerical value for the molar enthalpy of formation, but incorrect units.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to systematically calculate the enthalpy of formation for the given compound by following these steps.

This is the sum of all bond energies in the compound.\n4.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Formation (in kJ/mol)**: The enthalpy of formation is the difference between the reactant atomization enthalpy and the product atomization enthalpy.\n5.  **Convert to kJ/g**: Since some options are in kJ/g, I will calculate the molar mass of the compound and convert the enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g.\n6.  **Select the Final Answer**: I will compare my calculated result with the original options provided in the prompt to determine the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_enthalpy_formation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the enthalpy of formation for the given compound and determines the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze the Molecule and Define Given Data ---\n    # Molecular formula for (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 is C12H22.\n    num_C = 12\n    num_H = 22\n    \n    # Bond counts\n    num_CH_bonds = 22\n    num_CeqC_bonds = 2\n    # For an acyclic molecule, total C-C links = num_C -

Note that the numerical value `1900` matches option C, which has units of kJ/g, making it another distractor.\n\n**Step E: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. The options are in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. We must convert our result to kJ/g to make a final decision.\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **ΔHf° in kJ/g:** (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives **11.45 kJ/g**.

Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\nFirst, the molecular formula for the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 must be determined.\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** There are 12 carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms.\n*   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly indicates two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds in the carbon skeleton is the number of carbon atoms minus one (12 - 1 = 11). Since two of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change for the reaction where the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. The reaction is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the reactants is the energy required to convert them into gaseous atoms (12 C(g) and 22 H(g)).\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds: 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product**\n\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product, C12H22. It is the sum of all the bond energies.\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Total enthalpy of atomization of the product = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when the product is formed (which is equal to the product's enthalpy of atomization).\n*   ΔHf° = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Enthalpy of atomization of product)\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Convert to the Correct Units and Select the Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. We must now compare this to the given options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol\nC) 11200 kJ/mol\nD) 11.44 kJ/g\n\nOur calculated value in kJ/mol (1900) does not match option B. Option A has the correct numerical value but the wrong units. Option C is the enthalpy of atomization of the product, a common distractor. Option D is in kJ/g, so we must convert our answer to check it.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert ΔHf° to kJ/g:** (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value, rounded to two decimal places, is 11.45 kJ/g, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nThe goal is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) for the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 using the provided enthalpy of atomization and bond energy values.\n\n**2. Verify the Calculation Steps**\n\nThe standard method for this calculation, used by nearly all the provided answers, is correct and involves these key stages:\n\n*   **Step A: Determine Molecular Formula and Bond Count.**\n    *   The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    *   Counting the atoms gives the molecular formula **C12H22**.\n    *   Counting the bonds within the structure gives:\n        *   **22 C-H bonds** (one for each hydrogen atom).\n        *   **2 C=C bonds** (explicitly shown in the formula).\n        *   **9 C-C bonds** (the remaining bonds in the carbon skeleton).\n    *   This step was performed correctly by all agents who detailed their work.\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants.**\n    *   The formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g).\n    *   The energy required to turn the reactants into gaseous atoms is the sum of the atomization energies.\n    *   Atomization of Carbon: 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n    *   Atomization of Hydrogen (breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds): 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n    *   Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n    *   This calculation is consistent and correct across all detailed answers.\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product.**\n    *   This is the sum of all the bond energies in one mole of the compound.\n    *   Energy from C-H bonds: 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ.\n    *   Energy from C-C bonds: 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ.\n    *   Energy from C=C bonds: 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.\n    *   Total enthalpy of atomization of the product = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n    *   This calculation is also consistent and correct. Note that this value matches option D, making it a potential distractor.\n\n*   **Step D: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°).**\n    *   The formula is: ΔHf° = [ΔH_atom(reactants)] - [ΔH_atom(product)].\n    *   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n    *   This result is consistent and correct. Note that option B has this numerical value but incorrect units (kJ/g).\n\n*   **Step E: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer.**\n    *   The calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. The options are in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. We must convert our answer to kJ/g to compare it with option A.\n    *   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 166 g/mol.\n    *   ΔHf° (in kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\n**3. Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 11.45 kJ/g matches the value given in option A (11.44 kJ/g). The minor difference is due to rounding. The other options are incorrect:\n*   B) 1900 kJ/g: The numerical value is for kJ/mol, but the unit is incorrect.\n*   C) 67.4 kJ/mol: Incorrect value.\n*   D) 11200 kJ/mol: This is the enthalpy of atomization of the product, not the enthalpy of formation.\n\nThe analysis shows that the correct calculation leads to the value presented in option A. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers are due to inconsistent ordering of the options in their individual analyses, but the underlying numerical result is overwhelmingly consistent.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
