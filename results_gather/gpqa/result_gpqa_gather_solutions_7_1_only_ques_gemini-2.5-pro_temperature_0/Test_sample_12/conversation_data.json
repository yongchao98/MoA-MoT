It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is both less substituted and more accessible than the endocyclic one.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected. Product 1 is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Reaction:** Epoxidation of the remaining double bond at C1-C2.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4, which has an (R) configuration, bears a bulky isopropyl group. This group sterically hinders one face of the ring. For the (R) isomer, the isopropyl group is typically represented on a wedge. The m-CPBA will therefore attack from the less hindered face, which is *anti* to the isopropyl group (i.e., from the dashed face). This leads to the major diastereomer of the epoxide.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The epoxide oxygen is *trans* to the isopropyl group. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters (C1 and C2) reveals the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile CH₃O⁻.\n*   **Careful Points (Regio- and Stereoselectivity):**\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which involves an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The attack occurs from the face opposite the C-O bond (this is known as a trans-diaxial opening).\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The attack at C2 inverts its configuration from (R) to (S). The configurations at C1 (S) and C4 (R) are retained. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) at C1 is converted to a propionate ester.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the chiral centers in the molecule. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which is a mixture of isomers. Our analysis has followed the major pathway at each step, leading to the major isomer of the final product. Let's compare this structure to the given options:\n\nA) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering.\nB) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This perfectly matches the major product derived from our analysis.**\nC) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\nD) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2, which would imply a mechanistically incorrect retention of configuration during the epoxide opening.\n\nSince the major product of the reaction sequence is listed as an option, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis to determine the correct structure of product 4.\n\n### **Careful Points and Analysis**\n\nThe core of this problem lies in correctly tracking the stereochemistry through a sequence of stereoselective and stereospecific reactions.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation**\n    *   **Reactant:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one in the ring and a disubstituted one in the side chain.\n    *   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with only one equivalent of H₂.\n    *   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted double bonds. Therefore, the exocyclic (disubstituted) double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group.\n    *   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**. All candidate analyses agree on this point.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation**\n    *   **Reactant:** Product 1, which has an existing stereocenter at C4.\n    *   **Reaction:** Epoxidation with m-CPBA.\n    *   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** The bulky isopropyl group at C4 directs the incoming m-CPBA to the opposite face of the ring to minimize steric hindrance. This is called an *anti*-attack.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of the Major Epoxide (Product 2):**\n        *   Starting with the (R) configuration at C4, the isopropyl group is on a wedge (pointing \"up\").\n        *   The m-CPBA attacks from the *anti* face, which is the dashed face (\"down\").\n        *   This creates an epoxide with the oxygen on a dash. The methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 are consequently pushed to the wedge face.\n        *   Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the new stereocenters (C1 and C2) reveals the major epoxide to be the **(1S, 2R, 4R)** isomer.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Regio- and Stereospecific Epoxide Opening**\n    *   **Reactant:** The major epoxide, (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide (Product 2).\n    *   **Reaction:** Ring-opening with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. Therefore, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Stereospecificity):** This is an Sₙ2 reaction, which proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of the Major Alcohol (Product 3):**\n        *   The epoxide oxygen is on a dash. The methoxide attacks C2 from the opposite (wedge) side.\n        *   The configuration at C2, which was (R), inverts to **(S)**.\n        *   The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n        *   The configuration at C4 is retained as **(R)**.\n        *   The resulting major alcohol is the **(1S, 2S, 4R)** isomer.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Esterification**\n    *   **Reactant:** The major alcohol, (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol (Product 3).\n    *   **Reaction:** Steglich esterification with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP.\n    *   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group to an ester group without affecting any of the chiral centers.

Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence, when analyzed following the established principles of stereoselectivity and stereospecificity, yields (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate as the major isomer in the final product mixture. The question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which is present as a mixture. The major product is certainly a valid component of that mixture.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering.\n*   C) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This matches the derived structure of the major product.\n*   D) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This structure would result from an incorrect mechanism (e.g., retention of configuration during the Sₙ2 attack).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the structure corresponding to the major product of the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reaction Steps**\n\n*   **Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene.** The starting material, (R)-limonene, has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring and a disubstituted one in the side chain (isopropenyl group). Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Pd/C) is selective and will reduce the less substituted, more accessible exocyclic double bond first. Since only one equivalent of H₂ is used, this is the only reaction that occurs. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected.\n    *   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n*   **Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1.** Product 1 is treated with m-CPBA to form an epoxide across the remaining double bond (C1-C2). This reaction is diastereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 (which has an (R) configuration, typically drawn on a wedge) sterically hinders one face of the ring. The m-CPBA will therefore attack from the opposite (*anti*) face.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** The attack from the face opposite the wedged isopropyl group places the epoxide oxygen on a dashed bond. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters shows that the major epoxide isomer formed is **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening.** The epoxide (Product 2) is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile. Under these basic conditions, the reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism. The nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide, which is C2 (a secondary carbon) rather than C1 (a tertiary carbon). The Sₙ2 attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of Product 3:** The methoxide attacks C2, inverting its configuration from (R) to (S). The configuration at C1 is retained as (S). The resulting alcohol, after workup, is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n*   **Step 4: Esterification.** The alcohol (Product 3) is converted to an ester using propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification). This reaction occurs at the oxygen of the hydroxyl group and does not affect any of the stereocenters.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of Product 4:** The stereochemistry is retained from Product 3. The final product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\n**2. Comparison with Candidate Answers and Options**\n\nThe candidate answers show significant disagreement, particularly in assigning the stereochemistry of the epoxide and the subsequent ring-opening. However, a careful, step-by-step analysis following the major reaction pathways consistently leads to the (1S, 2S, 4R) isomer. Answers 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, and 13 all correctly identify this isomer as a final product, although their reasoning is sometimes flawed. The most mechanistically sound analyses (e.g., Answer 11, Answer 13) correctly trace the major pathway to this product.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe major product of the reaction sequence is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. Comparing this to the provided options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n*   B) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This matches our derived structure.**\n*   C) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect carbon skeleton.\n*   D) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and stereochemistry.\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: (R)-(+)-Limonene is hydrogenated to (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n# Step 2: Epoxidation with m-CPBA occurs anti to the bulky isopropyl group.

It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation is selective for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. The exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced in preference to the endocyclic trisubstituted double bond. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), an epoxidizing agent.\n*   **Analysis (Stereoselectivity):** The reaction is diastereoselective. The existing stereocenter at C4 has a bulky isopropyl group. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA will attack the double bond from the face *opposite* to this bulky group. This is known as *anti*-attack.\n*   **Determining Stereochemistry of Product 2:**\n    1.  In the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing out of the page).\n    2.  The *anti*-attack means the m-CPBA approaches from the dashed face (pointing into the page).\n    3.  The resulting epoxide oxygen will be on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 to be on wedges.\n    4.  Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) configurations to the new stereocenters:\n        *   **C1:** Priorities are O > C2 > C6 > CH₃. The lowest priority group (CH₃) is on a wedge. The path from O(1) to C2(2) to C6(3) is clockwise. For a wedged lowest-priority group, clockwise rotation corresponds to an (S) configuration.\n        *   **C2:** Priorities are O > C1 > C3 > H. The lowest priority group (H) is on a wedge. The path from O(1) to C1(2) to C3(3) is also clockwise. This also results in an (S) configuration.\n    5.  Therefore, the major isomer of **Product 2** is the **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-epoxide.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Analysis (Regio- and Stereoselectivity):** Under basic conditions, this is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Thus, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The Sₙ2 attack proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge side.\n*   **Determining Stereochemistry of Product 3:**\n    1.  The configuration at C2, which was (S), is inverted to **(R)**.\n    2.  The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n    3.  The configuration at C4 is unchanged as **(R)**.\n    4.  The resulting alcohol, **Product 3**, is **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect the stereochemistry of any chiral centers.\n*   **Product 4:** The stereochemistry is retained from Product 3. The final product is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe structure derived from the major reaction pathway is (1S, 2R, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic). It has a single stereocenter at C4 with an (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with only one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is less substituted (disubstituted) than the endocyclic one (trisubstituted). Therefore, the H₂ will add selectively across the exocyclic double bond, converting the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), a standard epoxidation reagent.\n*   **Analysis:** The m-CPBA will react with the remaining double bond in the ring. This reaction is diastereoselective due to the existing stereocenter at C4. The bulky isopropyl group sterically hinders one face of the ring, forcing the m-CPBA to approach from the opposite, less hindered face (*anti*-attack).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** By convention, the (R)-isopropyl group is drawn on a wedge (pointing up). The m-CPBA will therefore attack from the bottom face, placing the epoxide oxygen on a dash (pointing down). This is the major pathway. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) configurations for the new stereocenters:\n    *   C4 remains (R).\n    *   C1 becomes (S). (Priorities: O > C2 > C6 > CH₃. Lowest priority CH₃ is on a wedge. Path O→C2→C6 is clockwise, which would be R, but we reverse it to S).\n    *   C2 becomes (R). (Priorities: O > C1 > C3 > H. Lowest priority H is on a wedge. Path O→C1→C3 is counter-clockwise, which would be S, but we reverse it to R).\n    *   Thus, the major epoxide isomer is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Analysis:** Under basic conditions, epoxide opening is an Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon. C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. Therefore, the methoxide attacks C2.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   The epoxide oxygen is on a dash, so the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side.\n    *   The configuration at C2, which was **(R)**, inverts to **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**. The C1-O bond breaks to form a hydroxyl group (on a dash).\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the stereocenters.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The stereochemistry is retained from Product 3.

Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** The exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced selectively, converting it to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n### **Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Analysis:** The remaining double bond within the ring is converted into an epoxide. This reaction is diastereoselective.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** The existing chiral center at C4, which has an (R) configuration, bears a bulky isopropyl group. This group directs the incoming m-CPBA to the opposite face of the ring to minimize steric hindrance. This is known as an *anti*-attack and forms the major product.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The major product is the epoxide formed *trans* to the isopropyl group. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities reveals the stereochemistry of this major epoxide to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening that proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism under basic conditions.\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** Starting with the major epoxide (1S, 2R, 4R), the attack at C2 inverts its configuration from (R) to (S). The configurations at C1 and C4 are retained. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n### **Step 4: Esterification**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Steglich esterification, which converts the hydroxyl group into an ester.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect the stereochemistry of the chiral centers. The configuration is retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which exists as a mixture. Our analysis, following the major pathway at each step, leads to the structure (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

The existing chiral center at C4, which bears a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent will attack from the face of the ring *opposite* to the isopropyl group. This is called an *anti*-attack and leads to the major diastereomer.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** Assuming the (R)-isopropyl group is on a wedge, the m-CPBA attacks from the dashed face. This creates an epoxide where the oxygen is on a dash. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities reveals the stereochemistry of this major epoxide to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile CH₃O⁻.\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.

Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The methoxide attacks C2 of the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide. The configuration at C2, which was (R), is inverted to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester.

It has two double bonds: one is endocyclic (in the ring) and trisubstituted, the other is exocyclic (in the side chain) and disubstituted.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Selectivity:** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**. All candidate answers correctly identify this step.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** m-CPBA (3-chloroperbenzoic acid).\n*   **Reaction:** Epoxidation of the remaining C1-C2 double bond.\n*   **Stereoselectivity (Crucial Point):** This is a diastereoselective reaction.

The m-CPBA will therefore attack from the \"down\" face (dash). The epoxide oxygen will be on a dash.\n    3.  This forces the substituents on the former double bond (the C1-methyl and C2-hydrogen) to be pushed \"up\" (wedge).\n    4.  Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the new stereocenters:\n        *   **C1:** The priority order is O > C2 > C6 > CH₃. The lowest priority group (CH₃) is on a wedge.

C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked center (C2). The attack must be from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n    1.  In our major epoxide, the C2-O bond is on a dash.\n    2.  The methoxide must attack C2 from the wedge side.\n    3.

It reduces the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond more rapidly. The exocyclic double bond is less substituted (disubstituted) than the endocyclic one (trisubstituted). Therefore, the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction forms an epoxide across the remaining double bond (C1-C2). The reaction is diastereoselective, meaning the existing stereocenter at C4 directs the approach of the reagent. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 sterically hinders one face of the ring. To minimize steric repulsion, the m-CPBA will attack from the face *opposite* (*anti*) to the isopropyl group.

Lowest priority H is on a wedge, so the clockwise path O->C1->C3 is reversed from R to S).\n    *   Therefore, the major epoxide isomer is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n*   **Starting Material:** The major epoxide, Product 2, with (1S, 2S, 4R) stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Analysis:** Under basic conditions, this is an Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary, so the attack occurs at **C2**.

C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked center (C2). The attack occurs from the face opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge side. The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### **Step 4: Steglich Esterification**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction proceeds with retention of configuration at all chiral centers.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe major isomer formed in this reaction sequence is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**. Comparing this to the options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering.\n*   B) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n*   C) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This matches the derived structure of the major product.\n*   D) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n\nThe correct answer is the structure corresponding to the major product of the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the multi-step reaction to determine the correct structure for product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Reactant:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted endocyclic (in-ring) bond and a disubstituted exocyclic (side-chain) bond. The stereocenter at C4 is (R).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with 1 equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Selectivity:** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. Product 1 is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**. All candidate answers correctly identify this step.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Stereoselectivity (Key Point):** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4, which bears a bulky isopropyl group, directs the m-CPBA to attack from the less sterically hindered face of the double bond. For the (R) configuration, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge. The m-CPBA will therefore attack from the opposite face (*anti*-attack), placing the epoxide oxygen on a dash. This is the major pathway.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    *   The isopropyl group at C4 is (R) (on a wedge).\n    *   The epoxide oxygen is on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    *   Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities:\n        *   The configuration at C1 is **(S)**.\n        *   The configuration at C2 is **(R)**.\n    *   Therefore, the major isomer of Product 2 is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Regioselectivity (Key Point):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Key Point):** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which involves an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C2 is inverted from (R) to **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 is unchanged as **(R)**.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group at C1 is converted to a propionate ester.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the chiral centers. The configuration is retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final major product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe major product formed in the reaction sequence is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. We now compare this structure to the given options:\n\n*   A) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering (isopropyl is at C4).\n*   C) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This perfectly matches the derived structure of the major product.\n*   D) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This has the incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n\nSince the question asks for a valid structure from the product mixture and the major product is listed as an option, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step organic synthesis to determine the correct structure of Product 4.\n\n### **Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It possesses two double bonds: one inside the ring (endocyclic, trisubstituted) and one on the side chain (exocyclic, disubstituted). The stereocenter at C4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with one equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Analysis (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less sterically hindered and less substituted double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is less substituted than the endocyclic one. Therefore, the reaction selectively reduces the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The major product isolated is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n### **Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Analysis (Stereoselectivity):** This is an epoxidation reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4, bearing a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent will attack from the face of the ring opposite to the isopropyl group (*anti*-attack). This diastereoselective reaction leads to the formation of the major isomer of Product 2.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** Assuming the (R)-isopropyl group is on a wedge, the m-CPBA will attack from the dashed face. This places the epoxide oxygen on a dash. The new stereocenters at C1 and C2 can be assigned using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules. The major epoxide formed is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n### **Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a source of the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Analysis (Regio- and Stereoselectivity):** Under basic conditions, epoxide ring-opening occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks C2.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. The methoxide attacks C2 from the side opposite the C-O bond (i.e., from the wedged face, as the epoxide is on the dashed face). The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). The configuration at C1 is retained as (S).\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### **Step 4: Steglich Esterification of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The Steglich esterification is a mild method that proceeds with retention of configuration at all chiral centers.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nComparing the derived structure with the given options:\n\n*   A) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   B) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This perfectly matches the structure derived from the major reaction pathway.\n*   C) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and substitution pattern.\n*   D) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2, which would imply a mechanistically incorrect retention of configuration during the Sₙ2 ring-opening.\n\nThe correct answer is the structure corresponding to the major product of the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, highlighting the critical points of selectivity and stereochemistry.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the cyclohexene ring and a disubstituted one in the isopropenyl side chain.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with only one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. Therefore, the exocyclic (disubstituted) double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) to form an epoxide across the remaining double bond (C1-C2).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4, which has a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent will attack from the face *opposite* to the isopropyl group. This is the major pathway.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:** For the (R) configuration, the isopropyl group can be visualized as being on a wedge (pointing \"up\"). The m-CPBA therefore attacks from the \"down\" face, placing the epoxide oxygen on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges. Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities to this structure reveals the stereochemistry of the major epoxide isomer.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic ring-opening follows an Sₙ2 mechanism. The nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the attack occurs at C2.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 attack proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. The methoxide attacks C2 from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge side.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** The configuration at C2, which was (R) in the major epoxide, is inverted to (S). The configuration at C1 is retained as (S).\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification). This converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the chiral centers. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which exists as a mixture. The structure derived from the major reaction pathway is the most abundant isomer in this mixture and is therefore a valid answer. Our analysis shows the major isomer is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect structure.\nB) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering.\nC) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\nD) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This matches the structure of the major product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, highlighting the critical points for determining the final structure.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with only one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond.

Product 1 is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Reaction:** Epoxidation of the remaining double bond at C1-C2.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4, which has an (R) configuration, bears a bulky isopropyl group. This group sterically hinders one face of the ring. For the (R) isomer, the isopropyl group is typically represented on a wedge. The m-CPBA will therefore attack from the less hindered face, which is *anti* to the isopropyl group (i.e., from the dashed face). This leads to the major diastereomer of the epoxide.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The epoxide oxygen is *trans* to the isopropyl group. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters (C1 and C2) reveals the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile CH₃O⁻.\n*   **Careful Points (Regio- and Stereoselectivity):**\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which involves an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The attack occurs from the face opposite the C-O bond (this is known as a trans-diaxial opening).\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The attack at C2 inverts its configuration from (R) to (S). The configurations at C1 (S) and C4 (R) are retained. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) at C1 is converted to a propionate ester.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the chiral centers in the molecule. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which is a mixture of isomers. Our analysis has followed the major pathway at each step, leading to the major isomer of the final product. Let's compare this structure to the given options:\n\nA) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering.\nB) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This perfectly matches the major product derived from our analysis.**\nC) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\nD) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2, which would imply a mechanistically incorrect retention of configuration during the epoxide opening.\n\nSince the major product of the reaction sequence is listed as an option, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis to determine the correct structure of product 4.\n\n### **Careful Points and Analysis**\n\nThe core of this problem lies in correctly tracking the stereochemistry through a sequence of stereoselective and stereospecific reactions.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation**\n    *   **Reactant:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one in the ring and a disubstituted one in the side chain.\n    *   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with only one equivalent of H₂.\n    *   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted double bonds. Therefore, the exocyclic (disubstituted) double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group.\n    *   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**. All candidate analyses agree on this point.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation**\n    *   **Reactant:** Product 1, which has an existing stereocenter at C4.\n    *   **Reaction:** Epoxidation with m-CPBA.\n    *   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** The bulky isopropyl group at C4 directs the incoming m-CPBA to the opposite face of the ring to minimize steric hindrance. This is called an *anti*-attack.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of the Major Epoxide (Product 2):**\n        *   Starting with the (R) configuration at C4, the isopropyl group is on a wedge (pointing \"up\").\n        *   The m-CPBA attacks from the *anti* face, which is the dashed face (\"down\").\n        *   This creates an epoxide with the oxygen on a dash. The methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 are consequently pushed to the wedge face.\n        *   Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the new stereocenters (C1 and C2) reveals the major epoxide to be the **(1S, 2R, 4R)** isomer.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Regio- and Stereospecific Epoxide Opening**\n    *   **Reactant:** The major epoxide, (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide (Product 2).\n    *   **Reaction:** Ring-opening with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. Therefore, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Stereospecificity):** This is an Sₙ2 reaction, which proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of the Major Alcohol (Product 3):**\n        *   The epoxide oxygen is on a dash. The methoxide attacks C2 from the opposite (wedge) side.\n        *   The configuration at C2, which was (R), inverts to **(S)**.\n        *   The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n        *   The configuration at C4 is retained as **(R)**.\n        *   The resulting major alcohol is the **(1S, 2S, 4R)** isomer.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Esterification**\n    *   **Reactant:** The major alcohol, (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol (Product 3).\n    *   **Reaction:** Steglich esterification with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP.\n    *   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group to an ester group without affecting any of the chiral centers. The stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   **Structure of the Major Final Product (Product 4):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of the alcohol. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence, when analyzed following the established principles of stereoselectivity and stereospecificity, yields (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate as the major isomer in the final product mixture. The question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which is present as a mixture. The major product is certainly a valid component of that mixture.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering.\n*   C) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This matches the derived structure of the major product.\n*   D) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This structure would result from an incorrect mechanism (e.g., retention of configuration during the Sₙ2 attack).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the structure corresponding to the major product of the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reaction Steps**\n\n*   **Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene.** The starting material, (R)-limonene, has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring and a disubstituted one in the side chain (isopropenyl group). Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Pd/C) is selective and will reduce the less substituted, more accessible exocyclic double bond first. Since only one equivalent of H₂ is used, this is the only reaction that occurs. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected.\n    *   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n*   **Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1.** Product 1 is treated with m-CPBA to form an epoxide across the remaining double bond (C1-C2). This reaction is diastereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 (which has an (R) configuration, typically drawn on a wedge) sterically hinders one face of the ring. The m-CPBA will therefore attack from the opposite (*anti*) face.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** The attack from the face opposite the wedged isopropyl group places the epoxide oxygen on a dashed bond. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters shows that the major epoxide isomer formed is **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening.** The epoxide (Product 2) is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile. Under these basic conditions, the reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism. The nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide, which is C2 (a secondary carbon) rather than C1 (a tertiary carbon). The Sₙ2 attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of Product 3:** The methoxide attacks C2, inverting its configuration from (R) to (S). The configuration at C1 is retained as (S). The resulting alcohol, after workup, is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n*   **Step 4: Esterification.** The alcohol (Product 3) is converted to an ester using propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification). This reaction occurs at the oxygen of the hydroxyl group and does not affect any of the stereocenters.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of Product 4:** The stereochemistry is retained from Product 3. The final product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\n**2. Comparison with Candidate Answers and Options**\n\nThe candidate answers show significant disagreement, particularly in assigning the stereochemistry of the epoxide and the subsequent ring-opening. However, a careful, step-by-step analysis following the major reaction pathways consistently leads to the (1S, 2S, 4R) isomer. Answers 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, and 13 all correctly identify this isomer as a final product, although their reasoning is sometimes flawed. The most mechanistically sound analyses (e.g., Answer 11, Answer 13) correctly trace the major pathway to this product.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe major product of the reaction sequence is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. Comparing this to the provided options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n*   B) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This matches our derived structure.**\n*   C) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect carbon skeleton.\n*   D) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and stereochemistry.\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: (R)-(+)-Limonene is hydrogenated to (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n# Step 2: Epoxidation with m-CPBA occurs anti to the bulky isopropyl group.

It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation is selective for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. The exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced in preference to the endocyclic trisubstituted double bond. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), an epoxidizing agent.\n*   **Analysis (Stereoselectivity):** The reaction is diastereoselective. The existing stereocenter at C4 has a bulky isopropyl group. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA will attack the double bond from the face *opposite* to this bulky group. This is known as *anti*-attack.\n*   **Determining Stereochemistry of Product 2:**\n    1.  In the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing out of the page).\n    2.  The *anti*-attack means the m-CPBA approaches from the dashed face (pointing into the page).\n    3.  The resulting epoxide oxygen will be on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 to be on wedges.\n    4.  Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) configurations to the new stereocenters:\n        *   **C1:** Priorities are O > C2 > C6 > CH₃. The lowest priority group (CH₃) is on a wedge. The path from O(1) to C2(2) to C6(3) is clockwise. For a wedged lowest-priority group, clockwise rotation corresponds to an (S) configuration.\n        *   **C2:** Priorities are O > C1 > C3 > H. The lowest priority group (H) is on a wedge. The path from O(1) to C1(2) to C3(3) is also clockwise. This also results in an (S) configuration.\n    5.  Therefore, the major isomer of **Product 2** is the **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-epoxide.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Analysis (Regio- and Stereoselectivity):** Under basic conditions, this is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Thus, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The Sₙ2 attack proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge side.\n*   **Determining Stereochemistry of Product 3:**\n    1.  The configuration at C2, which was (S), is inverted to **(R)**.\n    2.  The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n    3.  The configuration at C4 is unchanged as **(R)**.\n    4.  The resulting alcohol, **Product 3**, is **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect the stereochemistry of any chiral centers.\n*   **Product 4:** The stereochemistry is retained from Product 3. The final product is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe structure derived from the major reaction pathway is (1S, 2R, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic). It has a single stereocenter at C4 with an (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with only one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is less substituted (disubstituted) than the endocyclic one (trisubstituted). Therefore, the H₂ will add selectively across the exocyclic double bond, converting the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), a standard epoxidation reagent.\n*   **Analysis:** The m-CPBA will react with the remaining double bond in the ring. This reaction is diastereoselective due to the existing stereocenter at C4. The bulky isopropyl group sterically hinders one face of the ring, forcing the m-CPBA to approach from the opposite, less hindered face (*anti*-attack).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** By convention, the (R)-isopropyl group is drawn on a wedge (pointing up). The m-CPBA will therefore attack from the bottom face, placing the epoxide oxygen on a dash (pointing down). This is the major pathway. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) configurations for the new stereocenters:\n    *   C4 remains (R).\n    *   C1 becomes (S). (Priorities: O > C2 > C6 > CH₃. Lowest priority CH₃ is on a wedge. Path O→C2→C6 is clockwise, which would be R, but we reverse it to S).\n    *   C2 becomes (R). (Priorities: O > C1 > C3 > H. Lowest priority H is on a wedge. Path O→C1→C3 is counter-clockwise, which would be S, but we reverse it to R).\n    *   Thus, the major epoxide isomer is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Analysis:** Under basic conditions, epoxide opening is an Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon. C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. Therefore, the methoxide attacks C2.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   The epoxide oxygen is on a dash, so the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side.\n    *   The configuration at C2, which was **(R)**, inverts to **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**. The C1-O bond breaks to form a hydroxyl group (on a dash).\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the stereocenters.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The stereochemistry is retained from Product 3. The final product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe structure derived from the major reaction pathway is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** The exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced selectively, converting it to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n### **Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Analysis:** The remaining double bond within the ring is converted into an epoxide. This reaction is diastereoselective.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** The existing chiral center at C4, which has an (R) configuration, bears a bulky isopropyl group. This group directs the incoming m-CPBA to the opposite face of the ring to minimize steric hindrance. This is known as an *anti*-attack and forms the major product.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The major product is the epoxide formed *trans* to the isopropyl group.

C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** Starting with the major epoxide (1S, 2R, 4R), the attack at C2 inverts its configuration from (R) to (S). The configurations at C1 and C4 are retained. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n### **Step 4: Esterification**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Steglich esterification, which converts the hydroxyl group into an ester.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect the stereochemistry of the chiral centers.

Our analysis, following the major pathway at each step, leads to the structure (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. We now compare this to the given options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and structure.\n*   B) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This matches our derived major product.**\n*   C) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would require the epoxide opening to proceed with retention of configuration, which is mechanistically incorrect for an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   D) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect structure; the ring double bond would have to survive epoxidation, which is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is the structure derived from the major reaction pathway.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, highlighting the critical points to determine the correct structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. The exocyclic double bond is both.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Reaction:** Epoxidation of the remaining endocyclic double bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a crucial step. The existing chiral center at C4, which bears a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent will attack from the face of the ring *opposite* to the isopropyl group. This is called an *anti*-attack and leads to the major diastereomer.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** Assuming the (R)-isopropyl group is on a wedge, the m-CPBA attacks from the dashed face. This creates an epoxide where the oxygen is on a dash. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities reveals the stereochemistry of this major epoxide to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile CH₃O⁻.\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The methoxide attacks C2 of the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide. The configuration at C2, which was (R), is inverted to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not break any bonds to the chiral carbons. Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **retention of configuration**.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The stereochemistry of the final product is the same as its alcohol precursor. The structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which exists as a mixture. The major product formed through the most favorable reaction pathway is a valid component of this mixture.

The existing stereocenter at C4, which has an (R) configuration, bears a bulky isopropyl group. This group directs the m-CPBA to attack from the opposite, less hindered face of the cyclohexene ring. This is known as an *anti*-attack and forms the major diastereomer of the epoxide.\n*   **Stereochemical Assignment:**\n    *   Assuming the (R)-isopropyl group is on a wedge (pointing \"up\"), the m-CPBA will attack from the dashed face (pointing \"down\").\n    *   The resulting epoxide oxygen will be on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 into a wedged orientation.\n    *   A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to these new stereocenters reveals the major epoxide isomer.\n    *   **Product 2 (major isomer):** The configuration is **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic ring-opening follows an Sₙ2 mechanism.

It has two double bonds: one is endocyclic (in the ring) and trisubstituted, the other is exocyclic (in the side chain) and disubstituted.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Selectivity:** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**. All candidate answers correctly identify this step.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** m-CPBA (3-chloroperbenzoic acid).\n*   **Reaction:** Epoxidation of the remaining C1-C2 double bond.\n*   **Stereoselectivity (Crucial Point):** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4, with its bulky isopropyl group, directs the m-CPBA to attack from the opposite face (*anti*-attack) to minimize steric hindrance. This forms the major product.\n*   **Determining the Major Epoxide's Stereochemistry:**\n    1.  In (R)-limonene, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing \"up\").\n    2.  The m-CPBA will therefore attack from the \"down\" face (dash). The epoxide oxygen will be on a dash.\n    3.  This forces the substituents on the former double bond (the C1-methyl and C2-hydrogen) to be pushed \"up\" (wedge).\n    4.  Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the new stereocenters:\n        *   **C1:** The priority order is O > C2 > C6 > CH₃. The lowest priority group (CH₃) is on a wedge. The path from O(1)→C2(2)→C6(3) is clockwise. With the lowest priority group pointing towards the viewer, the configuration is **(S)**.\n        *   **C2:** The priority order is O > C1 > C3 > H. The lowest priority group (H) is on a wedge. The path from O(1)→C1(2)→C3(3) is clockwise. With the lowest priority group pointing towards the viewer, the configuration is **(S)**.\n    5.  Therefore, the major diastereomer of Product 2 is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** The major epoxide, (1S, 2S, 4R)-epoxide (Product 2).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile CH₃O⁻.\n*   **Mechanism:** Base-catalyzed epoxide opening proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon. C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked center (C2). The attack must be from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n    1.  In our major epoxide, the C2-O bond is on a dash.\n    2.  The methoxide must attack C2 from the wedge side.\n    3.  The configuration at C2, which was **(S)**, is inverted to **(R)**.\n    4.  The configuration at C1 is not involved in the reaction and is retained as **(S)**.\n*   **Product 3:** The major alcohol isomer formed is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** The major alcohol, (1S, 2R, 4R)-alcohol (Product 3).\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group at C1 is converted to a propionate ester.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect the stereocenters.

The major product is certainly a valid component of that mixture.

It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reagents & Conditions:** H₂ gas, Pd/C catalyst, and only 1 equivalent of H₂ is consumed.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is selective. It reduces the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond more rapidly. The exocyclic double bond is less substituted (disubstituted) than the endocyclic one (trisubstituted). Therefore, the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction forms an epoxide across the remaining double bond (C1-C2). The reaction is diastereoselective, meaning the existing stereocenter at C4 directs the approach of the reagent. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 sterically hinders one face of the ring. To minimize steric repulsion, the m-CPBA will attack from the face *opposite* (*anti*) to the isopropyl group. This pathway leads to the major product.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Major Epoxide (Product 2):**\n    1.  In the (R)-isomer, we can visualize the isopropyl group on a wedge (pointing out of the page).\n    2.  The *anti*-attack by m-CPBA will occur from the bottom face, placing the epoxide oxygen on a dash.\n    3.  This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 to be on wedges.\n    4.  Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) configurations to the new stereocenters:\n        *   C4 remains **(R)**.\n        *   C1 becomes **(S)**. (Priorities: O > C2 > C6 > CH3. Lowest priority CH3 is on a wedge, so the clockwise path O->C2->C6 is reversed from R to S).\n        *   C2 becomes **(S)**. (Priorities: O > C1 > C3 > H. Lowest priority H is on a wedge, so the clockwise path O->C1->C3 is reversed from R to S).\n    *   Therefore, the major epoxide isomer is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n*   **Starting Material:** The major epoxide, Product 2, with (1S, 2S, 4R) stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Analysis:** Under basic conditions, this is an Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary, so the attack occurs at **C2**. The Sₙ2 mechanism proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked center.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Major Alcohol (Product 3):**\n    *   The configuration at C2 is inverted from **(S)** to **(R)**.\n    *   The configurations at C1 and C4 are unchanged, remaining **(S)** and **(R)**, respectively.\n    *   The resulting major alcohol product is **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Starting Material:** The major alcohol, Product 3, with (1S, 2R, 4R) stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the chiral centers.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Major Final Product (Product 4):**\n    *   The stereochemistry is retained from Product 3.\n    *   The final major product is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which is a mixture.

All candidate answers correctly identify this step.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Stereoselectivity (Key Point):** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4, which bears a bulky isopropyl group, directs the m-CPBA to attack from the less sterically hindered face of the double bond. For the (R) configuration, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge. The m-CPBA will therefore attack from the opposite face (*anti*-attack), placing the epoxide oxygen on a dash. This is the major pathway.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    *   The isopropyl group at C4 is (R) (on a wedge).\n    *   The epoxide oxygen is on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    *   Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities:\n        *   The configuration at C1 is **(S)**.\n        *   The configuration at C2 is **(R)**.\n    *   Therefore, the major isomer of Product 2 is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Regioselectivity (Key Point):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Key Point):** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which involves an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C2 is inverted from (R) to **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 is unchanged as **(R)**.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group at C1 is converted to a propionate ester.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the chiral centers. The configuration is retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final major product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe major product formed in the reaction sequence is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. We now compare this structure to the given options:\n\n*   A) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering (isopropyl is at C4).\n*   C) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This perfectly matches the derived structure of the major product.\n*   D) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This has the incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n\nSince the question asks for a valid structure from the product mixture and the major product is listed as an option, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step organic synthesis to determine the correct structure of Product 4.\n\n### **Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It possesses two double bonds: one inside the ring (endocyclic, trisubstituted) and one on the side chain (exocyclic, disubstituted). The stereocenter at C4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with one equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Analysis (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less sterically hindered and less substituted double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is less substituted than the endocyclic one. Therefore, the reaction selectively reduces the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The major product isolated is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n### **Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Analysis (Stereoselectivity):** This is an epoxidation reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4, bearing a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent will attack from the face of the ring opposite to the isopropyl group (*anti*-attack). This diastereoselective reaction leads to the formation of the major isomer of Product 2.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** Assuming the (R)-isopropyl group is on a wedge, the m-CPBA will attack from the dashed face. This places the epoxide oxygen on a dash. The new stereocenters at C1 and C2 can be assigned using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules. The major epoxide formed is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n### **Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a source of the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Analysis (Regio- and Stereoselectivity):** Under basic conditions, epoxide ring-opening occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks C2.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. The methoxide attacks C2 from the side opposite the C-O bond (i.e., from the wedged face, as the epoxide is on the dashed face). The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). The configuration at C1 is retained as (S).\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### **Step 4: Steglich Esterification of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The Steglich esterification is a mild method that proceeds with retention of configuration at all chiral centers.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nComparing the derived structure with the given options:\n\n*   A) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   B) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This perfectly matches the structure derived from the major reaction pathway.\n*   C) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and substitution pattern.\n*   D) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2, which would imply a mechanistically incorrect retention of configuration during the Sₙ2 ring-opening.\n\nThe correct answer is the structure corresponding to the major product of the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, highlighting the critical points of selectivity and stereochemistry.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the cyclohexene ring and a disubstituted one in the isopropenyl side chain.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with only one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. Therefore, the exocyclic (disubstituted) double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) to form an epoxide across the remaining double bond (C1-C2).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4, which has a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent will attack from the face *opposite* to the isopropyl group. This is the major pathway.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:** For the (R) configuration, the isopropyl group can be visualized as being on a wedge (pointing \"up\"). The m-CPBA therefore attacks from the \"down\" face, placing the epoxide oxygen on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges. Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities to this structure reveals the stereochemistry of the major epoxide isomer.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic ring-opening follows an Sₙ2 mechanism. The nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the attack occurs at C2.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 attack proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. The methoxide attacks C2 from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge side.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** The configuration at C2, which was (R) in the major epoxide, is inverted to (S). The configuration at C1 is retained as (S).\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification). This converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the chiral centers. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which exists as a mixture. The structure derived from the major reaction pathway is the most abundant isomer in this mixture and is therefore a valid answer. Our analysis shows the major isomer is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect structure.\nB) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering.\nC) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\nD) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This matches the structure of the major product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, highlighting the critical points for determining the final structure.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with only one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond.

This is called an *anti*-attack and forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):** Assuming the (R)-isopropyl group is on a wedge, the m-CPBA attacks from the dashed face. This creates the epoxide with its oxygen on a dash. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters at C1 and C2 reveals the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.
