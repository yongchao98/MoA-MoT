  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nYou have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\nMutant 4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’<b>\n\nA) Mutant 1\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** Different types of mutations have different impacts on protein function. In general, the severity from most disruptive to least disruptive is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon, terminating protein synthesis prematurely. If this happens early in the gene, it almost always results in a non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable but less severe than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to complete loss of function, depending on the specific amino acid change and its location.\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant:** We will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:**\n        *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n        *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1 (Option D):**\n        *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly...\n        *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** (`CTC` for Leucine changes to `TAC` for Tyrosine). It changes one amino acid. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2 (Option C):**\n        *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n        *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `CTC` codon for Leucine has been changed to `TAA`, which is a stop codon. This will halt protein synthesis after only two amino acids. The resulting truncated peptide is guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most effective type of mutation for this goal.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3 (Option A):**\n        *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val**...\n        *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4 (Option B):**\n        *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is altered, but the effect is less predictably severe than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable mutation. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Mapping:**\n    *   The most effective mutation is found in **Mutant 2**.\n    *   Mutant 2 corresponds to option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Objective**\nThe goal is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by a specific gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that prevents the gene from producing a functional protein. This is often called a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nTo understand which mutation is most severe, we must consider their impact on protein synthesis:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This may or may not inactivate the protein. The effect is often uncertain.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete codons (multiples of three DNA bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. Like a missense mutation, this may or may not inactivate the protein.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a codon for an amino acid into a \"stop\" codon. This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a shortened (truncated) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all amino acids after the mutation and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a very severe mutation.\n\nThe most reliable way to knock out a gene's function is to introduce a nonsense or frameshift mutation early in its sequence.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant Gene Sequence**\nFirst, let's establish the beginning of the protein sequence from the intact gene. The sequence is read in three-base codons starting from `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Translates to: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala... This is the functional protein.\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide, which will be non-functional. This is a highly effective knockout mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). While more disruptive than a single change, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to eliminate function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence has a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed) plus a missense mutation. The resulting protein is missing one amino acid and has another changed. This is a significant alteration but is less reliable for knocking out function than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe type of mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be produced. This makes it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe question asks to select the correct option from the list:\nA) Mutant 3\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 4\n\nBased on the analysis, Mutant 2 is the correct choice, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation that causes the most severe disruption to the protein encoded by the gene. A severely disrupted protein will be non-functional, thus preventing the synthesis of the compound. The most effective disruptions are typically nonsense mutations (creating a premature stop codon) or frameshift mutations, as these are more likely to result in a complete loss of function than missense mutations (amino acid substitutions).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for our analysis:\n1.  **Establish a Baseline:** We will first translate the initial part of the intact gene sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. This will serve as our reference for a functional protein.\n2.  **Create a Translation Tool:** We will use a Python dictionary to represent the genetic code, mapping each three-nucleotide codon to its specific amino acid or a \"STOP\" signal.\n3.  **Analyze Each Mutant:** We will translate each mutant sequence using our tool.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** By comparing the resulting protein sequences, we will identify the type of mutation (e.g., silent, missense, nonsense). The mutation causing the most significant change—specifically, the one that halts protein synthesis prematurely—will be identified as the most probable candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this analysis and print the results.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_mutations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes gene mutations to determine which is most likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n    This is achieved by translating the DNA sequences and identifying the most severe mutation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary to map DNA codons to single-letter amino acid codes.

This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. Therefore, the most effective way to eliminate the compound is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein. This is often called a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nWe need to evaluate the severity of different types of mutations in terms of their likelihood of causing a complete loss of protein function.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA that does not alter the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** A change that substitutes one amino acid for another. This *might* disrupt protein function, but it could also have little or no effect. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change that converts an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated protein. If this occurs early in the gene, it is almost certain to produce a non-functional protein.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** The removal or addition of one or more full codons (multiples of three nucleotides). This removes or adds amino acids but does not change the reading frame. The effect is less predictable than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Changes: `TTT` -> `TTC` (silent, both are Phe) and `CTC` -> `TAC` (missense, Leu -> Tyr).\n    *   Effect: A single amino acid is changed. This is a **missense mutation**. It is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Changes: `TTT` -> `TTC` (silent) and `CTC` -> `TAA` (nonsense, Leu -> STOP).\n    *   Effect: This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a STOP codon. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe) and will be non-functional. This is a highly effective knockout mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   Changes: This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   Changes: This involves a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** of one amino acid (Gly) plus a missense mutation. The reading frame is preserved. This is less likely to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nComparing the effects, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, guaranteeing the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe question options are:\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 1\n\nOur analysis shows that Mutant 2 is the correct choice, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional or absent protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene and the Principle of Translation**\nThe intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCT...-3’`. Protein synthesis (translation) starts at the `ATG` codon and reads the DNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides called codons. Each codon specifies an amino acid.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n*   **Translated Protein:** `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...`\n\nThis sequence produces the functional protein that synthesizes the unwanted compound.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Severity of Different Mutation Types**\nTo knock out a gene, the most effective mutations are those that cause the most severe disruption to the protein.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This terminates protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. This is a highly effective knockout strategy.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This may or may not inactivate the protein. The effect is uncertain.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is also uncertain.\n\n**4. Analyze Each Mutant**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala...`\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** `Met - Phe - STOP`\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val...`\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single change, it still produces a full-length protein with an uncertain functional outcome.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another one changed. This is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, guaranteeing the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most effective way to \"knock out\" the gene's function among the given choices.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the correct answer. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo decide the final answer, I will systematically analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein produced by the gene. The goal is to find the mutation most likely to result in a non-functional protein, which would eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the mutation that most reliably \"knocks out\" the gene's function. A gene's function is to produce a protein, so we are looking for the mutation that most severely disrupts protein synthesis.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** The starting sequence of the gene's coding region is provided. Protein synthesis begins at the `ATG` start codon and proceeds by reading the DNA in three-base groups called codons.\n    *   **Intact DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Translated Protein:** `ATG` (Methionine), `TTT` (Phenylalanine), `CTC` (Leucine), `GCT` (Alanine), `GGT` (Glycine)...\n    *   This sequence produces the functional protein that synthesizes the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Mutant:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n        *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this change might alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein is still produced at its full length.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n        *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**.\n        *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. It causes the cellular machinery to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Methionine-Phenylalanine). A protein this severely truncated is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n        *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). Similar to Mutant 1, this produces a full-length protein with altered amino acids, but a complete loss of function is not certain.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n        *   A comparison with the intact gene reveals that the `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 bases). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most effective mutations for inactivating a gene are those that cause the most severe disruption to the protein. A nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon early in the gene is the most reliable way to ensure a non-functional protein is produced.\n\n*   Mutant 1, 3, and 4 result in full-length or near-full-length proteins with one or more amino acid changes. The functional consequences are uncertain.\n*   Mutant 2 results in a severely truncated protein due to a premature stop codon at the third position. This will almost certainly lead to a complete loss of function.\n\nTherefore, the mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The question lists Mutant 2 as option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective approach is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout\".\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nTo understand which mutation is most effective, we must consider their potential impact on the final protein product:\n*   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA that does not alter the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** A change that substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed way to inactivate a protein.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change that converts a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost certain to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a very effective way to inactivate a protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** The removal or addition of a full codon (three bases). This removes or adds an amino acid but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is similar to a missense mutation—it may or may not inactivate the protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe gene's coding sequence starts with `ATG`, so we will analyze the sequence in groups of three (codons).\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be eliminated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** (`CTC` for Leucine changes to `TAC` for Tyrosine). It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - STOP\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA` (a STOP codon). Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. This is the most effective and probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val - Thr...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than one, it is still less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed. This is a significant alteration, but it is less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe most severe mutation presented is the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be produced. This makes it the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct option is Mutant 2, which corresponds to choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo decide the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of each mutation's effect on the resulting protein is necessary. The goal is to find the mutation most likely to produce a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Intact Gene\nFirst, we establish the normal protein sequence by translating the intact gene's DNA sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT`...-3’\n*   **Translation into Amino Acids:**\n    *   `ATG` = Methionine (Met) - Start\n    *   `TTT` = Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` = Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` = Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` = Glycine (Gly)\n*   **Resulting Protein Start:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly... This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Mutant's Effect\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT`...-3’\n*   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this change might alter the protein's function, it does not guarantee complete inactivation. The full-length protein is still produced.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT`...-3’\n*   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**.\n*   **Effect:** This mutation causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely after only the second amino acid. The resulting product would be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). A protein this severely truncated is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations**. The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). Similar to Mutant 1, this produces a full-length protein with altered amino acids, but complete loss of function is not certain.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n*   **Analysis:** This mutation involves a change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine) and a deletion of the `GGT` (Glycine) codon. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 bases). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. While this is a significant change, it is less likely to cause a complete knockout than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Mutations and Conclude\nThe most effective mutations for inactivating a gene are those that cause the most severe disruption to the protein.\n*   Mutants 1, 3, and 4 result in full-length or near-full-length proteins with one or more amino acid changes. The functional consequence of these changes is uncertain.\n*   Mutant 2 results in a **nonsense mutation** that introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the protein sequence. This halts protein synthesis, ensuring that a functional protein is not produced.\n\nTherefore, the mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 3\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 1\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to disrupt the gene's function so that it no longer produces a functional protein. The most effective way to do this is to introduce a mutation that causes a major disruption, such as stopping protein synthesis prematurely.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe intact gene sequence is the baseline for a functional protein. Let's break the beginning of the sequence into codons (groups of three nucleotides) to see the original amino acid sequence. Protein synthesis starts at the `ATG` codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`…-3’\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - Start\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n*   **Original Protein Start:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant's Effect**\n\n*   **Mutant 1 (Option A):**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   Translation: Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly...\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this might alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n*   **Mutant 2 (Option C):**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   Translation: Met-Phe-**STOP**\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It causes the cell's machinery to stop translation prematurely. The resulting protein will be severely truncated (only two amino acids long) and is almost certain to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3 (Option B):**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`…-3’\n    *   Translation: Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly-Val-Thr...\n    *   Analysis: This mutant contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). Like Mutant 1, this changes the amino acid sequence but still produces a full-length protein, so the loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 4 (Option D):**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`…-3’\n    *   Analysis: Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is an **in-frame deletion** (removing one amino acid) combined with a missense mutation. This is a significant change, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe most severe and predictable mutation for knocking out a gene's function is a nonsense mutation that occurs early in the sequence. Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the third position, which will halt protein synthesis and produce a tiny, non-functional peptide. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nMutant 2 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to disrupt the gene in a way that it no longer produces a functional protein. This is often called a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nThe most effective mutations for knocking out gene function are those that cause the most severe disruption to the protein's structure. Let's rank the likely severity:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated protein. If this occurs early in the gene, it is almost guaranteed to result in a non-functional protein. This is a very severe mutation.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a very severe mutation.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** The removal or addition of one or more full codons (a multiple of three nucleotides). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is less predictable and less likely to be a complete knockout than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This might alter or even destroy protein function, but it could also have little to no effect. It is less reliable for knocking out a gene.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nWe will break the DNA sequence into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and see how each mutation affects the resulting amino acid sequence.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the original, functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) changes to `GTC` (Valine). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to be a knockout than a nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a combination of an **in-frame deletion** and a **missense mutation**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe. It introduces a premature stop codon at the third position, which will halt protein synthesis and result in a severely truncated, non-functional protein. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 1\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to \"knock out\" the gene, meaning we must introduce a mutation that prevents the production of a functional protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nThe most effective mutations for inactivating a gene are those that cause the most severe disruption to the protein's structure. The hierarchy of severity is generally as follows:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. This is a very effective knockout method.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein. This is also very effective.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is variable; it might inactivate the protein, alter its function, or have no effect at all. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be eliminated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** (`CTC` for Leucine changes to `TAC` for Tyrosine). It changes one amino acid. This is not the most reliable way to inactivate the protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`, which is a stop codon. This will cause protein synthesis to stop after only two amino acids. The resulting peptide is severely truncated and will be non-functional. This is the most effective mutation for knocking out the gene.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (Leucine to Tyrosine and Threonine to Valine). While more disruptive than one change, it is still less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** This involves a **missense mutation** (Leucine to Tyrosine) and an **in-frame deletion** (the codon `GGT` for Glycine is removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe type of mutation presented. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be produced. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 3\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 2\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Reading Frame:** It is essential to correctly identify the start codon (`ATG`) and read the sequence in non-overlapping groups of three nucleotides (codons).\n2.  **Mutation Identification:** The key to this problem is accurately identifying the type of mutation (missense, nonsense, etc.) and understanding its biological consequence.\n3.  **Severity of Effect:** A nonsense mutation that occurs early in the gene is the most reliable way to create a non-functional protein among the given choices. It is generally more disruptive than missense mutations or in-frame deletions.\n4.  **Consistency:** The reasoning must logically lead to the final answer. In the provided candidate answers, many correctly identified Mutant 2 as the most severe but then selected the wrong corresponding letter. The correct reasoning points unequivocally to Mutant 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that \"knocks out\" the gene's function, preventing the synthesis of a functional protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nThe severity of a mutation's impact on protein function generally follows this hierarchy:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation (most severe):** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon. This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost always non-functional protein.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation (very severe):** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all downstream amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion (can be severe):** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of 3 nucleotides). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect depends on the importance of the altered region.\n*   **Missense Mutation (variable effect):** Substitutes one amino acid for another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, depending on the chemical properties of the amino acids and the location of the change.\n*   **Silent Mutation (no effect):** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid sequence.\n\n**3. Analyze the Gene Sequences**\nLet's break down the intact gene and each mutant into codons (3-base units) and see the effect on the translated protein. The start codon is `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one altered amino acid. This might not be enough to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide, which is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). It produces a full-length protein with two altered amino acids. The effect is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), this mutant has changed `CTC` to `TAC` (a missense mutation) and deleted the `GGT` codon (an **in-frame deletion**). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another one changed. While disruptive, it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most probable way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 1\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation most likely to result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot synthesize the compound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to disrupt the gene that codes for a protein responsible for synthesizing an anti-nutritional compound. The most effective way to do this is to introduce a mutation that prevents a full-length, functional protein from being made.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** The starting sequence of the gene's coding strand is provided. Protein synthesis (translation) begins at the `ATG` start codon and reads the sequence in groups of three nucleotides (codons).\n    *   **Intact Gene:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Translated Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This sequence produces the functional protein that needs to be eliminated.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Severity of Different Mutation Types:**\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. This may or may not inactivate the protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete codons (multiples of 3 bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. It may or may not inactivate the protein.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon into a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional. This is a highly effective \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Mutant:**\n    *   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT`...-3’\n        *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT`...-3’\n        *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to stop after only the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide instead of a full protein. This product will be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC`...-3’\n        *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations** compared to the intact gene: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). While more disruptive than a single change, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to eliminate function than a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`...-3’\n        *   This sequence has a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed), so the reading frame is not shifted. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most severe mutation presented is the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional peptide is produced. This is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. The correct option is the one corresponding to Mutant 2.\n\n*   A) Mutant 3\n*   B) Mutant 1\n*   C) Mutant 4\n*   D) Mutant 2\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo decide the final answer, I will perform a step-by-step analysis of the genetic mutations presented and determine which is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that \"knocks out\" the gene, preventing the production of a functional protein.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene\nFirst, let's establish the baseline by translating the beginning of the intact gene's coding sequence. The sequence is read in codons (groups of three nucleotides) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT`...-3’\n*   **Translation into Amino Acids:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - Start\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n*   **Resulting Protein Start:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly... This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant's Effect\nNow, let's analyze each mutant to determine the type of mutation and its likely impact on the protein. The most severe mutations are nonsense (creating a premature stop codon) and frameshift mutations, as they are most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this might alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** This mutation causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely after the second amino acid. The result is a severely truncated peptide (Met-Phe) that is almost certain to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** This mutant contains two **missense mutations**. The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). Similar to Mutant 1, this produces a full-length protein with altered amino acids, but the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 bases). The protein will be missing one amino acid and have another substituted. This is a significant change, but it is less likely to cause a complete knockout than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nComparing the effects of the mutations:\n*   Mutants 1, 3, and 4 result in full-length or near-full-length proteins with one or more amino acid changes (missense mutations or in-frame deletions). The impact of these changes is uncertain.\n*   Mutant 2 results in a **nonsense mutation**, introducing a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein. This will halt translation and produce a tiny, non-functional peptide.\n\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most drastic change and the one most likely to guarantee a complete loss of protein function. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. The question lists Mutant 2 as option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation that will most reliably result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot carry out its biological role, which in this case is the synthesis of the compound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each mutation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** First, we establish the original amino acid sequence by reading the DNA in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n    *   **Intact DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Intact Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    This sequence produces the functional protein that synthesizes the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Mutant's Effect:**\n    *   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n        *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. While this change might alter or reduce the protein's function, it does not guarantee a complete loss of function. The full-length protein is still produced.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n        *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   **Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This signals the cell's machinery to stop protein synthesis prematurely.\n        *   **Impact:** The resulting protein will be severely truncated, containing only two amino acids (Met-Phe). A protein this short is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n        *   **Change:** This mutant contains two amino acid substitutions: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n        *   **Type:** These are multiple **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this alters the protein but does not ensure it will be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n        *   **Change:** Comparing this to the intact gene, the `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   **Type:** This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion**. Because a full codon (3 bases) was deleted, the reading frame for the rest of the gene remains intact. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but it is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective way to eliminate a protein's function is to prevent its synthesis into a full-length, active form. The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). This will halt translation and produce a tiny, non-functional protein fragment. This is the most definitive and severe mutation among the choices, making it the most probable one to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to \"knock out\" the gene's function by introducing a mutation that prevents the production of a functional protein.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** To knock out a gene, the most effective mutations are those that cause the most severe disruption to the protein. The general order of severity is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. This is a highly effective knockout strategy.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is uncertain and less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This may or may not inactivate the protein. The effect is often uncertain.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant:** We will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n        *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala...\n        *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n        *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val**...\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single change, it still produces a full-length protein with an uncertain functional outcome.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed. This is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and predictable. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, guaranteeing the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most effective way to \"knock out\" the gene's function among the given choices.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Mapping:** The question asks to select the correct option from the list. We must carefully map our conclusion (Mutant 2) to the provided options.\n    *   A) Mutant 1\n    *   B) Mutant 3\n    *   C) Mutant 4\n    *   D) Mutant 2\n\n    Our analysis shows that Mutant 2 is the correct choice, which corresponds to option **D**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly Identify Mutation Type:** The core of the problem is distinguishing between missense, nonsense, and deletion mutations and understanding their biological consequences.\n2.  **Understand Mutation Severity:** A nonsense mutation that occurs early in the gene is the most reliable way to create a non-functional protein among the given choices. It is generally more disruptive than missense mutations or in-frame deletions.\n3.  **Pay Close Attention to the Option Mapping:** A common error is to correctly identify the best mutant but select the wrong letter option. The options (A, B, C, D) are not listed in the same order as the mutants (1, 2, 3, 4). It is crucial to match the correct mutant (Mutant 2) to its corresponding letter (D).\n4.  **Reading Frame:** It is essential to correctly identify the start codon (`ATG`) and read the sequence in non-overlapping groups of three nucleotides (codons) to determine the amino acid sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>"

In general, the severity from most disruptive to least disruptive is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon, terminating protein synthesis prematurely. If this happens early in the gene, it almost always results in a non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable but less severe than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to complete loss of function, depending on the specific amino acid change and its location.\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant:** We will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:**\n        *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n        *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1 (Option D):**\n        *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly...\n        *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** (`CTC` for Leucine changes to `TAC` for Tyrosine).

This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2 (Option C):**\n        *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n        *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `CTC` codon for Leucine has been changed to `TAA`, which is a stop codon. This will halt protein synthesis after only two amino acids. The resulting truncated peptide is guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most effective type of mutation for this goal.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3 (Option A):**\n        *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val**...\n        *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4 (Option B):**\n        *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is altered, but the effect is less predictably severe than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable mutation. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Mapping:**\n    *   The most effective mutation is found in **Mutant 2**.\n    *   Mutant 2 corresponds to option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Objective**\nThe goal is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by a specific gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that prevents the gene from producing a functional protein. This is often called a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nTo understand which mutation is most severe, we must consider their impact on protein synthesis:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This may or may not inactivate the protein. The effect is often uncertain.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete codons (multiples of three DNA bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. Like a missense mutation, this may or may not inactivate the protein.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a codon for an amino acid into a \"stop\" codon. This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a shortened (truncated) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all amino acids after the mutation and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a very severe mutation.\n\nThe most reliable way to knock out a gene's function is to introduce a nonsense or frameshift mutation early in its sequence.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant Gene Sequence**\nFirst, let's establish the beginning of the protein sequence from the intact gene. The sequence is read in three-base codons starting from `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Translates to: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala... This is the functional protein.\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide, which will be non-functional. This is a highly effective knockout mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). While more disruptive than a single change, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to eliminate function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence has a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed) plus a missense mutation. The resulting protein is missing one amino acid and has another changed. This is a significant alteration but is less reliable for knocking out function than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe type of mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be produced. This makes it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe question asks to select the correct option from the list:\nA) Mutant 3\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 4\n\nBased on the analysis, Mutant 2 is the correct choice, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation that causes the most severe disruption to the protein encoded by the gene. A severely disrupted protein will be non-functional, thus preventing the synthesis of the compound. The most effective disruptions are typically nonsense mutations (creating a premature stop codon) or frameshift mutations, as these are more likely to result in a complete loss of function than missense mutations (amino acid substitutions).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for our analysis:\n1.  **Establish a Baseline:** We will first translate the initial part of the intact gene sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. This will serve as our reference for a functional protein.\n2.  **Create a Translation Tool:** We will use a Python dictionary to represent the genetic code, mapping each three-nucleotide codon to its specific amino acid or a \"STOP\" signal.\n3.  **Analyze Each Mutant:** We will translate each mutant sequence using our tool.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** By comparing the resulting protein sequences, we will identify the type of mutation (e.g., silent, missense, nonsense).

This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. Therefore, the most effective way to eliminate the compound is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein. This is often called a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nWe need to evaluate the severity of different types of mutations in terms of their likelihood of causing a complete loss of protein function.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA that does not alter the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** A change that substitutes one amino acid for another. This *might* disrupt protein function, but it could also have little or no effect. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change that converts an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated protein. If this occurs early in the gene, it is almost certain to produce a non-functional protein.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** The removal or addition of one or more full codons (multiples of three nucleotides). This removes or adds amino acids but does not change the reading frame. The effect is less predictable than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Changes: `TTT` -> `TTC` (silent, both are Phe) and `CTC` -> `TAC` (missense, Leu -> Tyr).\n    *   Effect: A single amino acid is changed. This is a **missense mutation**. It is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Changes: `TTT` -> `TTC` (silent) and `CTC` -> `TAA` (nonsense, Leu -> STOP).\n    *   Effect: This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a STOP codon. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe) and will be non-functional. This is a highly effective knockout mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   Changes: This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   Changes: This involves a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** of one amino acid (Gly) plus a missense mutation. The reading frame is preserved. This is less likely to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nComparing the effects, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, guaranteeing the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe question options are:\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 1\n\nOur analysis shows that Mutant 2 is the correct choice, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional or absent protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene and the Principle of Translation**\nThe intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCT...-3’`. Protein synthesis (translation) starts at the `ATG` codon and reads the DNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides called codons. Each codon specifies an amino acid.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n*   **Translated Protein:** `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...`\n\nThis sequence produces the functional protein that synthesizes the unwanted compound.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Severity of Different Mutation Types**\nTo knock out a gene, the most effective mutations are those that cause the most severe disruption to the protein.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This terminates protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. This is a highly effective knockout strategy.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This may or may not inactivate the protein. The effect is uncertain.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is also uncertain.\n\n**4. Analyze Each Mutant**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala...`\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** `Met - Phe - STOP`\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val...`\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single change, it still produces a full-length protein with an uncertain functional outcome.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another one changed. This is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, guaranteeing the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most effective way to \"knock out\" the gene's function among the given choices.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the correct answer. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo decide the final answer, I will systematically analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein produced by the gene. The goal is to find the mutation most likely to result in a non-functional protein, which would eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the mutation that most reliably \"knocks out\" the gene's function. A gene's function is to produce a protein, so we are looking for the mutation that most severely disrupts protein synthesis.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** The starting sequence of the gene's coding region is provided. Protein synthesis begins at the `ATG` start codon and proceeds by reading the DNA in three-base groups called codons.\n    *   **Intact DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Translated Protein:** `ATG` (Methionine), `TTT` (Phenylalanine), `CTC` (Leucine), `GCT` (Alanine), `GGT` (Glycine)...\n    *   This sequence produces the functional protein that synthesizes the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Mutant:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n        *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this change might alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein is still produced at its full length.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n        *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**.\n        *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. It causes the cellular machinery to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Methionine-Phenylalanine). A protein this severely truncated is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n        *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). Similar to Mutant 1, this produces a full-length protein with altered amino acids, but a complete loss of function is not certain.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n        *   A comparison with the intact gene reveals that the `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 bases). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most effective mutations for inactivating a gene are those that cause the most severe disruption to the protein. A nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon early in the gene is the most reliable way to ensure a non-functional protein is produced.\n\n*   Mutant 1, 3, and 4 result in full-length or near-full-length proteins with one or more amino acid changes. The functional consequences are uncertain.\n*   Mutant 2 results in a severely truncated protein due to a premature stop codon at the third position. This will almost certainly lead to a complete loss of function.\n\nTherefore, the mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The question lists Mutant 2 as option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective approach is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout\".\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nTo understand which mutation is most effective, we must consider their potential impact on the final protein product:\n*   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA that does not alter the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** A change that substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed way to inactivate a protein.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change that converts a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost certain to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a very effective way to inactivate a protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** The removal or addition of a full codon (three bases). This removes or adds an amino acid but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is similar to a missense mutation—it may or may not inactivate the protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe gene's coding sequence starts with `ATG`, so we will analyze the sequence in groups of three (codons).\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be eliminated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** (`CTC` for Leucine changes to `TAC` for Tyrosine). It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - STOP\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA` (a STOP codon). Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. This is the most effective and probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val - Thr...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than one, it is still less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed. This is a significant alteration, but it is less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe most severe mutation presented is the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be produced. This makes it the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct option is Mutant 2, which corresponds to choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo decide the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of each mutation's effect on the resulting protein is necessary. The goal is to find the mutation most likely to produce a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Intact Gene\nFirst, we establish the normal protein sequence by translating the intact gene's DNA sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT`...-3’\n*   **Translation into Amino Acids:**\n    *   `ATG` = Methionine (Met) - Start\n    *   `TTT` = Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` = Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` = Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` = Glycine (Gly)\n*   **Resulting Protein Start:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly... This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Mutant's Effect\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT`...-3’\n*   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this change might alter the protein's function, it does not guarantee complete inactivation. The full-length protein is still produced.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT`...-3’\n*   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**.\n*   **Effect:** This mutation causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely after only the second amino acid. The resulting product would be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). A protein this severely truncated is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations**. The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). Similar to Mutant 1, this produces a full-length protein with altered amino acids, but complete loss of function is not certain.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n*   **Analysis:** This mutation involves a change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine) and a deletion of the `GGT` (Glycine) codon. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 bases). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. While this is a significant change, it is less likely to cause a complete knockout than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Mutations and Conclude\nThe most effective mutations for inactivating a gene are those that cause the most severe disruption to the protein.\n*   Mutants 1, 3, and 4 result in full-length or near-full-length proteins with one or more amino acid changes. The functional consequence of these changes is uncertain.\n*   Mutant 2 results in a **nonsense mutation** that introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the protein sequence. This halts protein synthesis, ensuring that a functional protein is not produced.\n\nTherefore, the mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 3\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 1\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to disrupt the gene's function so that it no longer produces a functional protein. The most effective way to do this is to introduce a mutation that causes a major disruption, such as stopping protein synthesis prematurely.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe intact gene sequence is the baseline for a functional protein. Let's break the beginning of the sequence into codons (groups of three nucleotides) to see the original amino acid sequence. Protein synthesis starts at the `ATG` codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`…-3’\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - Start\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n*   **Original Protein Start:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant's Effect**\n\n*   **Mutant 1 (Option A):**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   Translation: Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly...\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this might alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n*   **Mutant 2 (Option C):**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   Translation: Met-Phe-**STOP**\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It causes the cell's machinery to stop translation prematurely. The resulting protein will be severely truncated (only two amino acids long) and is almost certain to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3 (Option B):**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`…-3’\n    *   Translation: Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly-Val-Thr...\n    *   Analysis: This mutant contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). Like Mutant 1, this changes the amino acid sequence but still produces a full-length protein, so the loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 4 (Option D):**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`…-3’\n    *   Analysis: Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is an **in-frame deletion** (removing one amino acid) combined with a missense mutation. This is a significant change, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe most severe and predictable mutation for knocking out a gene's function is a nonsense mutation that occurs early in the sequence. Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the third position, which will halt protein synthesis and produce a tiny, non-functional peptide. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nMutant 2 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to disrupt the gene in a way that it no longer produces a functional protein. This is often called a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nThe most effective mutations for knocking out gene function are those that cause the most severe disruption to the protein's structure. Let's rank the likely severity:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated protein. If this occurs early in the gene, it is almost guaranteed to result in a non-functional protein. This is a very severe mutation.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a very severe mutation.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** The removal or addition of one or more full codons (a multiple of three nucleotides). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is less predictable and less likely to be a complete knockout than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This might alter or even destroy protein function, but it could also have little to no effect. It is less reliable for knocking out a gene.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nWe will break the DNA sequence into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and see how each mutation affects the resulting amino acid sequence.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the original, functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) changes to `GTC` (Valine). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to be a knockout than a nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a combination of an **in-frame deletion** and a **missense mutation**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe. It introduces a premature stop codon at the third position, which will halt protein synthesis and result in a severely truncated, non-functional protein. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 1\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to \"knock out\" the gene, meaning we must introduce a mutation that prevents the production of a functional protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nThe most effective mutations for inactivating a gene are those that cause the most severe disruption to the protein's structure. The hierarchy of severity is generally as follows:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. This is a very effective knockout method.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein. This is also very effective.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is variable; it might inactivate the protein, alter its function, or have no effect at all. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be eliminated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** (`CTC` for Leucine changes to `TAC` for Tyrosine). It changes one amino acid. This is not the most reliable way to inactivate the protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`, which is a stop codon. This will cause protein synthesis to stop after only two amino acids. The resulting peptide is severely truncated and will be non-functional. This is the most effective mutation for knocking out the gene.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (Leucine to Tyrosine and Threonine to Valine). While more disruptive than one change, it is still less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** This involves a **missense mutation** (Leucine to Tyrosine) and an **in-frame deletion** (the codon `GGT` for Glycine is removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe type of mutation presented. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be produced. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 3\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 2\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Reading Frame:** It is essential to correctly identify the start codon (`ATG`) and read the sequence in non-overlapping groups of three nucleotides (codons).\n2.  **Mutation Identification:** The key to this problem is accurately identifying the type of mutation (missense, nonsense, etc.) and understanding its biological consequence.\n3.  **Severity of Effect:** A nonsense mutation that occurs early in the gene is the most reliable way to create a non-functional protein among the given choices. It is generally more disruptive than missense mutations or in-frame deletions.\n4.  **Consistency:** The reasoning must logically lead to the final answer. In the provided candidate answers, many correctly identified Mutant 2 as the most severe but then selected the wrong corresponding letter. The correct reasoning points unequivocally to Mutant 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that \"knocks out\" the gene's function, preventing the synthesis of a functional protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nThe severity of a mutation's impact on protein function generally follows this hierarchy:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation (most severe):** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon. This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost always non-functional protein.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation (very severe):** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all downstream amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion (can be severe):** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of 3 nucleotides). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect depends on the importance of the altered region.\n*   **Missense Mutation (variable effect):** Substitutes one amino acid for another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, depending on the chemical properties of the amino acids and the location of the change.\n*   **Silent Mutation (no effect):** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid sequence.\n\n**3. Analyze the Gene Sequences**\nLet's break down the intact gene and each mutant into codons (3-base units) and see the effect on the translated protein. The start codon is `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one altered amino acid. This might not be enough to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide, which is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). It produces a full-length protein with two altered amino acids. The effect is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), this mutant has changed `CTC` to `TAC` (a missense mutation) and deleted the `GGT` codon (an **in-frame deletion**). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another one changed. While disruptive, it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most probable way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 1\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation most likely to result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot synthesize the compound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to disrupt the gene that codes for a protein responsible for synthesizing an anti-nutritional compound. The most effective way to do this is to introduce a mutation that prevents a full-length, functional protein from being made.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** The starting sequence of the gene's coding strand is provided. Protein synthesis (translation) begins at the `ATG` start codon and reads the sequence in groups of three nucleotides (codons).\n    *   **Intact Gene:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Translated Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This sequence produces the functional protein that needs to be eliminated.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Severity of Different Mutation Types:**\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. This may or may not inactivate the protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete codons (multiples of 3 bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. It may or may not inactivate the protein.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon into a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional. This is a highly effective \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Mutant:**\n    *   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT`...-3’\n        *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT`...-3’\n        *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to stop after only the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide instead of a full protein. This product will be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC`...-3’\n        *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations** compared to the intact gene: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). While more disruptive than a single change, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to eliminate function than a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`...-3’\n        *   This sequence has a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed), so the reading frame is not shifted. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most severe mutation presented is the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional peptide is produced. This is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. The correct option is the one corresponding to Mutant 2.\n\n*   A) Mutant 3\n*   B) Mutant 1\n*   C) Mutant 4\n*   D) Mutant 2\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo decide the final answer, I will perform a step-by-step analysis of the genetic mutations presented and determine which is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that \"knocks out\" the gene, preventing the production of a functional protein.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene\nFirst, let's establish the baseline by translating the beginning of the intact gene's coding sequence. The sequence is read in codons (groups of three nucleotides) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT`...-3’\n*   **Translation into Amino Acids:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - Start\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n*   **Resulting Protein Start:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly... This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant's Effect\nNow, let's analyze each mutant to determine the type of mutation and its likely impact on the protein. The most severe mutations are nonsense (creating a premature stop codon) and frameshift mutations, as they are most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this might alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** This mutation causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely after the second amino acid. The result is a severely truncated peptide (Met-Phe) that is almost certain to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** This mutant contains two **missense mutations**. The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). Similar to Mutant 1, this produces a full-length protein with altered amino acids, but the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 bases). The protein will be missing one amino acid and have another substituted. This is a significant change, but it is less likely to cause a complete knockout than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nComparing the effects of the mutations:\n*   Mutants 1, 3, and 4 result in full-length or near-full-length proteins with one or more amino acid changes (missense mutations or in-frame deletions). The impact of these changes is uncertain.\n*   Mutant 2 results in a **nonsense mutation**, introducing a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein. This will halt translation and produce a tiny, non-functional peptide.\n\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most drastic change and the one most likely to guarantee a complete loss of protein function. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. The question lists Mutant 2 as option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation that will most reliably result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot carry out its biological role, which in this case is the synthesis of the compound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each mutation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** First, we establish the original amino acid sequence by reading the DNA in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n    *   **Intact DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Intact Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    This sequence produces the functional protein that synthesizes the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Mutant's Effect:**\n    *   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n        *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. While this change might alter or reduce the protein's function, it does not guarantee a complete loss of function. The full-length protein is still produced.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n        *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   **Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This signals the cell's machinery to stop protein synthesis prematurely.\n        *   **Impact:** The resulting protein will be severely truncated, containing only two amino acids (Met-Phe). A protein this short is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n        *   **Change:** This mutant contains two amino acid substitutions: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n        *   **Type:** These are multiple **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this alters the protein but does not ensure it will be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n        *   **Change:** Comparing this to the intact gene, the `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   **Type:** This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion**. Because a full codon (3 bases) was deleted, the reading frame for the rest of the gene remains intact. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but it is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective way to eliminate a protein's function is to prevent its synthesis into a full-length, active form. The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). This will halt translation and produce a tiny, non-functional protein fragment. This is the most definitive and severe mutation among the choices, making it the most probable one to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
