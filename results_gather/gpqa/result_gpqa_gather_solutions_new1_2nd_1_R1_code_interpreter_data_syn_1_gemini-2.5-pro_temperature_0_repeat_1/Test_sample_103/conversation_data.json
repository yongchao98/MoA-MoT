In this method, the observed periodic shift in a star's spectral line wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (the component of its velocity along our line of sight). The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n    *   For star 1: K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   For star 2: K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes is: K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Physical Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    *   K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n    *   Where P is the orbital period, mₚ is the planet's mass, Mₛ is the star's mass, i is the orbital inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions and Assumptions:**\n    *   **Identical Star Masses:** The problem states the stars have the same masses (Mₛ₁ = Ms₂).\n    *   **Similar Planet Masses:** The problem states the planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, the quantity that is actually measured is the *minimum mass*, `mₚ sin(i)`, because the inclination `i` is generally unknown. Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that the minimum masses are similar: `(mₚ sin(i))₁ ≈ (mₚ sin(i))₂`. This is a standard assumption in such comparative problems.\n    *   With these conditions, the term `(mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))` is constant for both systems.\n\n4.  **Derive the Relationship between Velocity (K) and Period (P):** Since all other factors in the formula are constant between the two systems, the relationship simplifies to a direct proportionality between K and P:\n    *   K ∝ (1 / P)^(1/3)  or  K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:** We can set up a ratio for the two systems using this proportionality:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We can now substitute the known ratio of the velocities (K₂ / K₁ = 1.4) and solve for the question's target: the ratio P₂ / P₁.\n    *   1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To isolate the period ratio, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    *   2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio P₂ / P₁ is approximately 0.36. This matches option C. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many correctly perform the derivation, they often select the wrong final letter. However, the physics and mathematics consistently point to ~0.36.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Relate the Observable Quantity to a Physical Parameter\n\nThe problem provides the periodic shift of a spectral line (Δλ), which is the observable quantity in the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This wavelength shift is a direct consequence of the Doppler effect caused by the star's velocity along our line of sight as it \"wobbles\" due to the planet's gravity.\n\nThe maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n*   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\nTherefore, we can find the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n*   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n### 2. Identify the Governing Physical Formula\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n*   K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n*   Mₛ is the star's mass.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the axis of the orbit).\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 3. Apply Simplifying Assumptions Based on the Problem Statement\n\nThe problem provides key information that allows us to simplify the relationship:\n*   **Identical Star Masses:** Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂.\n*   **Similar Planet Masses:** In the context of the RV method, the quantity that is actually measured is the \"minimum mass,\" which is `mₚ sin(i)`. The statement that the planets have \"similar masses\" implies that this measured quantity is the same for both systems. Therefore, we assume (mₚ₁ sin i₁) ≈ (mₚ₂ sin i₂).\n\nWith these two conditions, the term `(2πG)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))` is effectively constant for both systems. This simplifies the relationship between K and P to a direct proportionality:\n*   K ∝ P^(-1/3)  or  K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\nThis means that a larger radial velocity amplitude (a bigger \"wobble\") corresponds to a shorter orbital period.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nUsing the proportionality from the previous step, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n*   K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nWe now have two expressions for the ratio K₂ / K₁:\n1.  From the wavelength shifts: K₂ / K₁ = 1.4\n2.  From the physical formula: K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nEquating these gives:\n*   1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (P₂ / P₁). To find this, we first solve for P₁ / P₂ by cubing both sides of the equation:\n*   (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n*   2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nFinally, we take the reciprocal to get the desired ratio:\n*   P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, the correct approach involves using the principles of the radial velocity (RV) method for exoplanet detection. The majority of the candidate answers correctly identify the physical laws and formulas, although many fail to select the correct final option letter.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the correct reasoning:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The RV method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light caused by its \"wobble\" as a planet orbits it. The maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K). Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Equation:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    *   K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n    *   Where P is the orbital period, Mₛ is the star's mass, mₚ is the planet's mass, and *i* is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:** The problem states that the stellar masses are identical (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂) and the planetary masses are similar. In the context of the RV method, the measurable quantity is the \"minimum mass,\" which is mₚ sin(i). Therefore, the statement implies that the minimum masses are the same for both planets (mₚ₁ sin(i₁) ≈ mₚ₂ sin(i₂)).\n\n4.  **Simplify the Relationship:** Because the stellar masses and planetary minimum masses are the same for both systems, these terms, along with the physical constants, cancel out when we take a ratio. This leaves a simple proportionality between the radial velocity amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P):\n    *   K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio for the two systems to solve for the periods:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    Substitute the known ratio of the velocities:\n    *   1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio P₂ / P₁, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    *   2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.36. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) ~ 0.85\n    *   B) ~ 1.96\n    *   C) ~ 0.36\n    *   D) ~ 1.40\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The problem describes the detection of exoplanets using the Radial Velocity (RV) method.

The maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum observed wavelength shifts:\n        `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4`\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    `K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))`\n    where:\n    *   `T` is the orbital period.\n    *   `mₚ` is the planet's mass.\n    *   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n    *   `i` is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Conditions and Assumptions (Careful Points):**\n    *   **Star Mass:** The problem states the stars have \"exactly the same masses\" (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   **Planet Mass:** The problem states the planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" A crucial point in the RV method is that it measures the *minimum mass*, which is the quantity `mₚ sin(i)`.

Therefore, `(mₚ sin(i))₁ ≈ (mₚ sin(i))₂`.\n    *   **Simplification:** Because the star masses and the minimum planet masses are the same for both systems, all terms in the formula for K are constant except for the orbital period, T.

A larger velocity shift (K) for the same mass objects implies the planet is orbiting closer and faster, hence it has a shorter period. Since planet #2's system has a larger shift (7 vs 5), it makes physical sense that its period is shorter (a ratio less than 1).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Relate the Observable (Wavelength Shift) to a Physical Quantity (Radial Velocity)\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.

The physics and mathematics consistently point to ~0.36.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Relate the Observable Quantity (Wavelength Shift) to a Physical Parameter (Radial Velocity)**\n\nThe problem describes the Radial Velocity (RV) method. In this method, the periodic shift in the wavelength of a star's spectral lines ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is measured. This shift is caused by the Doppler effect as the star moves towards and away from us (its radial velocity) due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n\nThe maximum observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, which is denoted by the letter $K$.\n$K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n\nTherefore, we can find the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes for the two stars directly from the given wavelength shifts:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = 1.4$\n\n**2. Relate the Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to the Orbital Period (T)**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the star is given by the formula:\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T$ is the orbital period.\n*   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n*   $i$ is the orbital inclination (the angle of the orbit relative to our line of sight).\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n**3. Apply the Problem's Conditions and Simplifying Assumptions**\n\nThe problem states:\n*   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star, 1} = M_{star, 2}$.\n*   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p, 1} \\approx m_{p, 2}$.\n*   A key point for RV problems is that the measurement constrains the *minimum mass*, which is the term $m_p \\sin i$. For the problem to be solvable with the given information, we must assume that this measured quantity is the same for both systems: $(m_p \\sin i)_1 \\approx (m_p \\sin i)_2$.\n\nWith these conditions, all terms in the formula for $K$ are constant between the two systems except for the orbital period, $T$. This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n$K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n**4.

Understand the Core Physical Principles\n\nThe problem involves the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. The key principles are:\n*   **Doppler Effect:** An orbiting planet causes its host star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This motion along our line of sight causes a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines.\n*   **Relationship between Wavelength Shift and Velocity:** The magnitude of the wavelength shift (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (`v_r`). The maximum observed shift (`Δλ_max`) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, a value denoted as `K`.\n*   **Radial Velocity Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude `K` is related to the system's physical parameters by the formula:\n    `K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))`\n    where `T` is the orbital period, `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Given Information and Assumptions\n\n*   **Observable Data:**\n    *   Wavelength shift for system 1: `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstrom.\n    *   Wavelength shift for system 2: `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstrom.\n*   **System Parameters:**\n    *   The stars have identical masses: `M_star1 = M_star2`.\n    *   The planets have similar masses. In the context of the RV method, the measured quantity is the *minimum mass*, `m_p * sin(i)`. For the problem to be solvable, we must assume this quantity is the same for both planets: `(m_p * sin(i))₁ ≈ (m_p * sin(i))₂`.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Find the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K).**\n    Since `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ_max`, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\n    `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4`\n\n2.  **Establish the relationship between K and the orbital period T.**\n    Let's write the ratio of `K₂` to `K₁` using the full formula:\n    `K₂ / K₁ = [ (2πG / T₂)^(1/3) * ((m_p * sin(i))₂ / M_star2^(2/3)) ] / [ (2πG / T₁)^(1/3) * ((m_p * sin(i))₁ / M_star1^(2/3)) ]`\n\n3.  **Simplify the ratio using the given assumptions.**\n    Since `M_star1 = M_star2` and `(m_p * sin(i))₁ ≈ (m_p * sin(i))₂`, these terms cancel out, along with the constant `2πG`. The expression simplifies significantly:\n    `K₂ / K₁ = (1 / T₂)^(1/3) / (1 / T₁)^(1/3)`\n    `K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the ratio of the periods (T₂ / T₁).**\n    We now have two expressions for `K₂ / K₁`. Let's equate them:\n    `1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n\n    To isolate the period ratio, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    `(1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂`\n    `2.744 = T₁ / T₂`\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio `T₂ / T₁`. We find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    `T₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio `T₂ / T₁` is approximately 0.36. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. This makes physical sense: a larger velocity wobble (`K₂ > K₁`) for the same masses implies the planet is orbiting closer and faster, resulting in a shorter period (`T₂ < T₁`).\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires us to determine the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets based on radial velocity (RV) measurements. Let's break down the physics and the calculation step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)\n\nThe RV method detects planets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in their host star's light. The maximum observed wavelength shift, `Δλ_max`, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, `K`.\n\n*   `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n\nGiven the data:\n*   `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstrom\n*   `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstrom\n\nWe can find the ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n*   `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4`\n\n### Step 2: Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T)\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:\n*   `K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `T` is the orbital period.\n*   `mₚ` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Problem's Conditions and Assumptions\n\nThe problem provides key information that simplifies this formula for comparison:\n1.  **Identical star masses:** `M_star₁ = M_star₂`.\n2.  **Similar planet masses:** In the context of the RV method, the measurable quantity is the *minimum mass*, `mₚ sin(i)`. The statement that the planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\" implies that this measured quantity is the same for both systems: `(mₚ sin(i))₁ ≈ (mₚ sin(i))₂`.\n\nBecause the terms for stellar mass and planetary minimum mass are the same for both systems, they cancel out when we take a ratio. This leaves a simple proportionality between `K` and `T`:\n*   `K ∝ T⁻¹/³`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nUsing the proportionality from Step 3, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n*   `K₂ / K₁ = (T₂)⁻¹/³ / (T₁)⁻¹/³ = (T₁ / T₂)¹/³`\n\nNow, we substitute the ratio of `K` we found in Step 1:\n*   `1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)¹/³`\n\nTo find the desired ratio, `T₂ / T₁`, we first solve for `T₁ / T₂` by cubing both sides:\n*   `T₁ / T₂ = 1.4³ = 2.744`\n\nFinally, we take the reciprocal to get `T₂ / T₁`:\n*   `T₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio `T₂ / T₁` is approximately 0.36. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.

Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The maximum observed shift in wavelength, Δλ, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, K.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum observed wavelength shifts:\n*   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n### 2. Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period.\n*   **mₚ** is the planet's mass.\n*   **Mₛ** is the star's mass.\n*   **i** is the orbital inclination.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 3.

This leads to a simple proportionality:\n\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nWe can use this proportionality to set up a ratio for the two systems:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nWe already know that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. Substituting this value:\n\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo find the ratio P₂ / P₁, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n\n(1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We find this by taking the reciprocal:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.36. This corresponds to option D.

The maximum observed shift in wavelength, Δλ, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n\nGiven the data:\n*   Wavelength shift for planet #1's star: Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n*   Wavelength shift for planet #2's star: Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is therefore equal to the ratio of their wavelength shifts:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n### Step 2: The Formula for Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n\nK = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   T is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   mₚ is the mass of the planet.\n*   M_star is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Given Information and Key Assumptions\n\nWe must carefully consider the information provided in the problem:\n*   **Identical stellar masses:** The problem states the stars have the same masses, so M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n*   **Similar planetary masses:** The planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune.\" A critical point in the RV method is that it cannot determine the planet's true mass (mₚ) and the orbital inclination (i) independently. It measures the product `mₚ sin(i)`, known as the planet's \"minimum mass.\" Therefore, the statement that the planets have similar masses implies that their minimum masses are approximately equal: (mₚ sin i)₁ ≈ (mₚ sin i)₂.\n\nWith these conditions, the terms involving the stellar mass and the planetary minimum mass are constant for both systems.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Relate the Observable Quantity (Wavelength Shift) to a Physical Parameter (Radial Velocity)\n\nThe problem describes the Radial Velocity (RV) method, where the periodic shift in a star's spectral line wavelength (`Δλ`) is measured. This shift is a Doppler effect caused by the star's \"wobble\" as it is pulled by an orbiting planet. The maximum observed wavelength shift (`Δλ_max`) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, a value denoted as `K`.\n\n*   **Proportionality:** `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n\nTherefore, we can find the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes for the two stars directly from the given wavelength shifts:\n\n*   `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4`\n\n### 2. Identify the Governing Physical Formula\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (`K`) is given by the formula:\n\n`K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `T` is the orbital period.\n*   `mₚ` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 3. Apply the Problem's Conditions and Key Assumptions\n\nThe problem provides crucial information that allows us to simplify the relationship for comparison:\n*   **Identical Star Masses:** The problem states the stars have \"exactly the same masses\" (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n*   **Similar Planet Masses (Careful Point):** The problem states the planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" A critical point in the RV method is that it cannot determine the planet's true mass (`mₚ`) and the orbital inclination (`i`) independently. It measures the product `mₚ sin(i)`, which is known as the planet's \"minimum mass.\" For a comparative problem like this to be solvable, we must assume that this measured quantity is what is \"similar\" for both planets. Therefore, we assume `(mₚ sin(i))₁ ≈ (mₚ sin(i))₂`.\n\nWith these two conditions, all terms in the formula for `K` are constant for both systems except for the orbital period, `T`. This simplifies the relationship to a direct proportionality:\n\n*   `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`\n\nThis means that a larger radial velocity amplitude (a bigger \"wobble\") corresponds to a shorter orbital period.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nUsing the proportionality from the previous step, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n\n*   `K₂ / K₁ = (T₂)^(-1/3) / (T₁)^(-1/3) = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we substitute the value for the ratio `K₂ / K₁` that we found in Step 1:\n\n*   `1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n\nThe question asks for the ratio `T₂ / T₁`. To find it, we first solve for `T₁ / T₂` by cubing both sides of the equation:\n\n*   `(1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂`\n*   `2.744 = T₁ / T₂`\n\nFinally, we take the reciprocal of this value to get the desired ratio:\n\n*   `T₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio `T₂ / T₁` is approximately 0.36. Comparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.40\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

In this method, the observed periodic shift in a star's spectral line wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (the component of its velocity along our line of sight). The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n    *   For star 1: K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   For star 2: K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes is: K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Physical Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    *   K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n    *   Where P is the orbital period, mₚ is the planet's mass, Mₛ is the star's mass, i is the orbital inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions and Assumptions:**\n    *   **Identical Star Masses:** The problem states the stars have the same masses (Mₛ₁ = Ms₂).\n    *   **Similar Planet Masses:** The problem states the planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, the quantity that is actually measured is the *minimum mass*, `mₚ sin(i)`, because the inclination `i` is generally unknown. Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that the minimum masses are similar: `(mₚ sin(i))₁ ≈ (mₚ sin(i))₂`. This is a standard assumption in such comparative problems.\n    *   With these conditions, the term `(mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))` is constant for both systems.\n\n4.  **Derive the Relationship between Velocity (K) and Period (P):** Since all other factors in the formula are constant between the two systems, the relationship simplifies to a direct proportionality between K and P:\n    *   K ∝ (1 / P)^(1/3)  or  K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:** We can set up a ratio for the two systems using this proportionality:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We can now substitute the known ratio of the velocities (K₂ / K₁ = 1.4) and solve for the question's target: the ratio P₂ / P₁.\n    *   1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To isolate the period ratio, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    *   2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio P₂ / P₁ is approximately 0.36. This matches option C. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many correctly perform the derivation, they often select the wrong final letter. However, the physics and mathematics consistently point to ~0.36.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Relate the Observable Quantity to a Physical Parameter\n\nThe problem provides the periodic shift of a spectral line (Δλ), which is the observable quantity in the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This wavelength shift is a direct consequence of the Doppler effect caused by the star's velocity along our line of sight as it \"wobbles\" due to the planet's gravity.\n\nThe maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n*   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\nTherefore, we can find the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n*   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n### 2. Identify the Governing Physical Formula\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n*   K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n*   Mₛ is the star's mass.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the axis of the orbit).\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 3. Apply Simplifying Assumptions Based on the Problem Statement\n\nThe problem provides key information that allows us to simplify the relationship:\n*   **Identical Star Masses:** Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂.\n*   **Similar Planet Masses:** In the context of the RV method, the quantity that is actually measured is the \"minimum mass,\" which is `mₚ sin(i)`. The statement that the planets have \"similar masses\" implies that this measured quantity is the same for both systems. Therefore, we assume (mₚ₁ sin i₁) ≈ (mₚ₂ sin i₂).\n\nWith these two conditions, the term `(2πG)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))` is effectively constant for both systems. This simplifies the relationship between K and P to a direct proportionality:\n*   K ∝ P^(-1/3)  or  K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\nThis means that a larger radial velocity amplitude (a bigger \"wobble\") corresponds to a shorter orbital period.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nUsing the proportionality from the previous step, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n*   K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nWe now have two expressions for the ratio K₂ / K₁:\n1.  From the wavelength shifts: K₂ / K₁ = 1.4\n2.  From the physical formula: K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nEquating these gives:\n*   1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (P₂ / P₁). To find this, we first solve for P₁ / P₂ by cubing both sides of the equation:\n*   (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n*   2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nFinally, we take the reciprocal to get the desired ratio:\n*   P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, the correct approach involves using the principles of the radial velocity (RV) method for exoplanet detection. The majority of the candidate answers correctly identify the physical laws and formulas, although many fail to select the correct final option letter.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the correct reasoning:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The RV method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light caused by its \"wobble\" as a planet orbits it. The maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K). Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Equation:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    *   K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n    *   Where P is the orbital period, Mₛ is the star's mass, mₚ is the planet's mass, and *i* is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:** The problem states that the stellar masses are identical (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂) and the planetary masses are similar. In the context of the RV method, the measurable quantity is the \"minimum mass,\" which is mₚ sin(i). Therefore, the statement implies that the minimum masses are the same for both planets (mₚ₁ sin(i₁) ≈ mₚ₂ sin(i₂)).\n\n4.  **Simplify the Relationship:** Because the stellar masses and planetary minimum masses are the same for both systems, these terms, along with the physical constants, cancel out when we take a ratio. This leaves a simple proportionality between the radial velocity amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P):\n    *   K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio for the two systems to solve for the periods:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    Substitute the known ratio of the velocities:\n    *   1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio P₂ / P₁, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    *   2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.36. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) ~ 0.85\n    *   B) ~ 1.96\n    *   C) ~ 0.36\n    *   D) ~ 1.40\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The problem describes the detection of exoplanets using the Radial Velocity (RV) method.

A larger velocity shift (K) for the same mass objects implies the planet is orbiting closer and faster, hence it has a shorter period. Since planet #2's system has a larger shift (7 vs 5), it makes physical sense that its period is shorter (a ratio less than 1).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1.

The magnitude of the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n\n*   **Proportionality:** K ∝ Δλ\n*   **Given Data:**\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n*   **Ratio:** The ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n### 2. Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Period\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n*   Mₛ is the star's mass.\n*   i is the orbital inclination.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 3. Apply the Problem's Constraints and Assumptions\n\nThe problem provides key information that simplifies this relationship:\n*   **Identical Star Masses:** Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂.\n*   **Similar Planet Masses:** In the context of the RV method, the quantity that is actually measured is the minimum mass, `mₚ sin(i)`. The statement that the planets have \"similar masses\" implies that this measured quantity is the same for both systems. This is a standard assumption for such comparative problems. Therefore, (mₚ sin(i))₁ ≈ (mₚ sin(i))₂.\n\nBecause the terms for the star's mass and the planet's minimum mass are the same for both systems, the relationship between K and P simplifies to a direct proportionality:\n\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nUsing the proportionality from the previous step, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nWe now have two expressions for the ratio K₂ / K₁, which we can set equal to each other:\n\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nThe question asks for the ratio P₂ / P₁, so we must solve for it. First, cube both sides of the equation:\n\n(1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nFinally, take the reciprocal of both sides to find the desired ratio:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\n### 5.

Relate the Observable Quantity (Wavelength Shift) to a Physical Parameter (Radial Velocity)**\n\nThe problem describes the Radial Velocity (RV) method. In this method, the periodic shift in the wavelength of a star's spectral lines ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is measured. This shift is caused by the Doppler effect as the star moves towards and away from us (its radial velocity) due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n\nThe maximum observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, which is denoted by the letter $K$.\n$K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n\nTherefore, we can find the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes for the two stars directly from the given wavelength shifts:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = 1.4$\n\n**2. Relate the Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to the Orbital Period (T)**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the star is given by the formula:\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T$ is the orbital period.\n*   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n*   $i$ is the orbital inclination (the angle of the orbit relative to our line of sight).\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n**3. Apply the Problem's Conditions and Simplifying Assumptions**\n\nThe problem states:\n*   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star, 1} = M_{star, 2}$.\n*   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p, 1} \\approx m_{p, 2}$.\n*   A key point for RV problems is that the measurement constrains the *minimum mass*, which is the term $m_p \\sin i$. For the problem to be solvable with the given information, we must assume that this measured quantity is the same for both systems: $(m_p \\sin i)_1 \\approx (m_p \\sin i)_2$.\n\nWith these conditions, all terms in the formula for $K$ are constant between the two systems except for the orbital period, $T$. This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n$K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n\nUsing the proportionality from Step 3, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nNow, we substitute the value for the ratio $K_2/K_1$ that we found in Step 1:\n$1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe question asks for the ratio $T_2/T_1$. To find it, we first cube both sides of the equation to solve for $T_1/T_2$:\n$(1.4)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n$2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n\nFinally, we take the reciprocal of this value to get the desired ratio:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital periods ($T_2/T_1$) is ~0.36. This matches option A. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many agents performed the correct calculation, several made errors in mapping their numerical result to the correct letter option.

Understand the Core Physical Principles\n\nThe problem involves the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. The key principles are:\n*   **Doppler Effect:** An orbiting planet causes its host star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This motion along our line of sight causes a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines.\n*   **Relationship between Wavelength Shift and Velocity:** The magnitude of the wavelength shift (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (`v_r`). The maximum observed shift (`Δλ_max`) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, a value denoted as `K`.\n*   **Radial Velocity Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude `K` is related to the system's physical parameters by the formula:\n    `K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))`\n    where `T` is the orbital period, `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Given Information and Assumptions\n\n*   **Observable Data:**\n    *   Wavelength shift for system 1: `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstrom.\n    *   Wavelength shift for system 2: `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstrom.\n*   **System Parameters:**\n    *   The stars have identical masses: `M_star1 = M_star2`.\n    *   The planets have similar masses. In the context of the RV method, the measured quantity is the *minimum mass*, `m_p * sin(i)`. For the problem to be solvable, we must assume this quantity is the same for both planets: `(m_p * sin(i))₁ ≈ (m_p * sin(i))₂`.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Find the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K).**\n    Since `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ_max`, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\n    `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4`\n\n2.  **Establish the relationship between K and the orbital period T.**\n    Let's write the ratio of `K₂` to `K₁` using the full formula:\n    `K₂ / K₁ = [ (2πG / T₂)^(1/3) * ((m_p * sin(i))₂ / M_star2^(2/3)) ] / [ (2πG / T₁)^(1/3) * ((m_p * sin(i))₁ / M_star1^(2/3)) ]`\n\n3.  **Simplify the ratio using the given assumptions.**\n    Since `M_star1 = M_star2` and `(m_p * sin(i))₁ ≈ (m_p * sin(i))₂`, these terms cancel out, along with the constant `2πG`. The expression simplifies significantly:\n    `K₂ / K₁ = (1 / T₂)^(1/3) / (1 / T₁)^(1/3)`\n    `K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the ratio of the periods (T₂ / T₁).**\n    We now have two expressions for `K₂ / K₁`. Let's equate them:\n    `1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n\n    To isolate the period ratio, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    `(1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂`\n    `2.744 = T₁ / T₂`\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio `T₂ / T₁`. We find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    `T₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio `T₂ / T₁` is approximately 0.36. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. This makes physical sense: a larger velocity wobble (`K₂ > K₁`) for the same masses implies the planet is orbiting closer and faster, resulting in a shorter period (`T₂ < T₁`).\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires us to determine the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets based on radial velocity (RV) measurements.

The maximum observed wavelength shift, `Δλ_max`, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, `K`.\n\n*   `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n\nGiven the data:\n*   `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstrom\n*   `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstrom\n\nWe can find the ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n*   `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4`\n\n### Step 2: Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T)\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:\n*   `K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `T` is the orbital period.\n*   `mₚ` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Problem's Conditions and Assumptions\n\nThe problem provides key information that simplifies this formula for comparison:\n1.  **Identical star masses:** `M_star₁ = M_star₂`.\n2.  **Similar planet masses:** In the context of the RV method, the measurable quantity is the *minimum mass*, `mₚ sin(i)`. The statement that the planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\" implies that this measured quantity is the same for both systems: `(mₚ sin(i))₁ ≈ (mₚ sin(i))₂`.\n\nBecause the terms for stellar mass and planetary minimum mass are the same for both systems, they cancel out when we take a ratio. This leaves a simple proportionality between `K` and `T`:\n*   `K ∝ T⁻¹/³`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nUsing the proportionality from Step 3, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n*   `K₂ / K₁ = (T₂)⁻¹/³ / (T₁)⁻¹/³ = (T₁ / T₂)¹/³`\n\nNow, we substitute the ratio of `K` we found in Step 1:\n*   `1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)¹/³`\n\nTo find the desired ratio, `T₂ / T₁`, we first solve for `T₁ / T₂` by cubing both sides:\n*   `T₁ / T₂ = 1.4³ = 2.744`\n\nFinally, we take the reciprocal to get `T₂ / T₁`:\n*   `T₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio `T₂ / T₁` is approximately 0.36. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.

The maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n        K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Equation:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n    Where:\n    *   T is the orbital period.\n    *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n    *   Mₛ is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Apply Problem Constraints and Assumptions:**\n    *   **Identical Star Masses:** The problem states Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂.\n    *   **Similar Planet Masses:** In the context of the RV method, the quantity that is actually measured is the *minimum mass*, `mₚ sin(i)`. The statement that the planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\" implies that this measured quantity is the same for both systems. This is a standard and necessary assumption to solve such a problem. Therefore, we assume (mₚ sin(i))₁ ≈ (mₚ sin(i))₂.\n    *   **Simplification:** With the stellar masses and planetary minimum masses being equal for both systems, the formula for K simplifies to a direct proportionality with the period (T):\n        K ∝ T^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Period Ratio:** We can now use this proportionality to relate the two systems. A more direct way to set up the ratio to avoid errors is:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (T₁)^(-1/3) / (T₂)^(-1/3) = (T₂ / T₁)^(1/3)\n\n    We know the ratio of the velocities from the wavelength shifts:\n    K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7\n\n    Now, we equate the two expressions for the ratio:\n    (T₂ / T₁)^(1/3) = 5 / 7\n\n    To find the final answer, T₂ / T₁, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    T₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    T₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343\n    T₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This aligns with option A.\n\n    *Self-Correction/Sanity Check:* Planet #2 causes a larger velocity wobble (7 mÅ vs 5 mÅ). For planets of the same mass, a larger wobble implies the planet is closer to its star. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit corresponds to a shorter period. Therefore, we expect T₂ to be shorter than T₁, meaning the ratio T₂/T₁ must be less than 1. This check eliminates options C and D, confirming our result is in the correct range.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires us to determine the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets based on data from the radial velocity (RV) method. Here is a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. The maximum observed shift in wavelength, Δλ, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n\nGiven the data:\n*   Wavelength shift for planet #1's star: Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n*   Wavelength shift for planet #2's star: Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is therefore equal to the ratio of their wavelength shifts:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n### Step 2: The Formula for Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n\nK = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   T is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   mₚ is the mass of the planet.\n*   M_star is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Given Information and Key Assumptions\n\nWe must carefully consider the information provided in the problem:\n*   **Identical stellar masses:** The problem states the stars have the same masses, so M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n*   **Similar planetary masses:** The planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune.\" A critical point in the RV method is that it cannot determine the planet's true mass (mₚ) and the orbital inclination (i) independently. It measures the product `mₚ sin(i)`, known as the planet's \"minimum mass.\" Therefore, the statement that the planets have similar masses implies that their minimum masses are approximately equal: (mₚ sin i)₁ ≈ (mₚ sin i)₂.\n\nWith these conditions, the terms involving the stellar mass and the planetary minimum mass are constant for both systems. The formula simplifies to a direct proportionality between K and the period T:\n\nK ∝ T^(-1/3)\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nUsing the proportionality from Step 3, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = (T₂)^(-1/3) / (T₁)^(-1/3) = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\nWe now have two expressions for the ratio K₂ / K₁, which we can equate:\n1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\nThe question asks for the ratio T₂ / T₁, so we must solve for it. First, cube both sides of the equation:\n(1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂\n2.744 = T₁ / T₂\n\nFinally, to get the desired ratio, we take the reciprocal of this value:\nT₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
