Understand the Core Concept**\nThe fundamental question is about identifying which molecules exhibit optical isomerism. A molecule shows optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center or the lack of any symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Chirality can also arise from a chiral axis (atropisomerism) or a chiral plane.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system where the two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond. All four positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') have large, bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃).\n    *   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** In such substituted biphenyls, the bulky groups prevent the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This locked conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral due to a phenomenon called atropisomerism (a form of axial chirality) and will exhibit optical isomerism. All candidate answers that provide detailed reasoning agree on this point.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate, its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Careful Point (Chiral Center):** We must check for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** We must check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the central carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond. It possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral and therefore not optically active. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n**3. Final Decision**\nBased on the unanimous reasoning across all detailed analyses:\n*   Compound 1 is optically active.\n*   Compound 2 is optically active.\n*   Compound 3 is not optically active.\n*   Compound 4 is not optically active.\n\nThe set of compounds showing optical isomerism is {1, 2}. This corresponds to option B. While several candidate answers selected incorrect letters (C or D), their own textual analysis correctly identified that only compounds 1 and 2 are chiral, indicating an error in their final selection rather than their reasoning. The correct reasoning consistently points to compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism, we must assess each molecule for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from a lack of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond. Normally, there is free rotation around this bond. However, this compound has bulky substituents (nitro groups, -NO₂, and dimethyl carboxylate groups, -COOCH₃) at all four *ortho*-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). These large groups sterically hinder each other, preventing the two rings from rotating freely and becoming coplanar. This restricted rotation, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation that lacks a plane of symmetry. As a result, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    A carbon atom bonded to four distinct substituents is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). The presence of this single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the central carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and possesses both a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and a **center of inversion** (at the midpoint of the C=C double bond). The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral and thus not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, we must analyze each molecule for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from the presence of a chiral center or other elements of chirality like a chiral axis, and the absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of each compound:**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a biphenyl derivative where the two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism)**: In biphenyl systems, bulky substituents at the ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') can prevent the two rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can lock the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has bulky nitro groups (-NO₂) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃) at all four ortho-positions. This creates significant steric hindrance, preventing the rings from becoming coplanar. The resulting stable, twisted structure lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure**: Also known as methyl lactate, its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Careful Point (Chiral Center)**: We must check for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Analysis**: The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is inherently chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure**: Its structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   **Careful Point (Symmetry)**: We need to check for elements of symmetry.\n    *   **Analysis**: The molecule does not have a chiral center. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid.\n    *   **Careful Point (Symmetry)**: This is a geometric isomer, but we need to assess its chirality.\n    *   **Analysis**: The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, it possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Decision**:\nBased on the analysis, only compounds 1 (due to atropisomerism) and 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the question requires evaluating each compound for chirality, which is the necessary condition for a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism.

This typically arises from a chiral center or some form of axial or planar chirality, and the absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of each compound:**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a biphenyl derivative where the two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Key Feature**: The positions adjacent to the connecting bond (ortho-positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky substituents: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Analysis**: These large groups cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This restricted rotation, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. It can exist as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is chiral and therefore shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure**: Also known as methyl lactate, its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Key Feature**: The presence of a potential chiral center.\n    *   **Analysis**: The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is inherently chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound has a chiral center and therefore shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure**: (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Key Feature**: The presence of symmetry.\n    *   **Analysis**: The molecule does not have a chiral center. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon-oxygen double bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Key Feature**: The presence of symmetry.\n    *   **Analysis**: The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of either of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nBased on the analysis, only compounds **1** (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and **2** (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we must analyze each molecule for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from a lack of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond. Due to the presence of large, bulky substituents (nitro groups and dimethyl carboxylate groups) at all four *ortho*-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around this central bond is severely restricted. This phenomenon, known as steric hindrance, locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. This specific type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation, is called atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom in the chain is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is a chiral center. The presence of this single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The molecule is symmetrical. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the central carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry at the midpoint of the C=C double bond). The presence of this symmetry element makes the molecule achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism, we must assess each molecule for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from the absence of any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This molecule consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single bond. All four positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with bulky groups (two nitro groups and two dimethyl carboxylate groups).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The large size of these substituents creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure**: Also known as methyl lactate, its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We must check for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to:\n        1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure**: Its formula is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It has a central carbonyl group attached to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule does not have a chiral center. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond. It possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Due to these elements of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, only compounds **1** and **2** are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key indicators for chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Common structural features leading to chirality include chiral centers and axial chirality (e.g., atropisomerism).\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structural Feature**: This is a biphenyl molecule with substituents at all four *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism)**: The presence of bulky groups (nitro -NO₂ and dimethyl carboxylate -COOCH₃) at these positions creates significant steric hindrance. This prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond, locking them into a non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This restricted rotation creates a chiral axis. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism. All candidate answers with detailed reasoning correctly identify this.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structural Feature**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Careful Point (Chiral Center)**: We must check for carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.

Understand the Core Concept**\nThe fundamental question is about identifying which molecules exhibit optical isomerism. A molecule shows optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center or the lack of any symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Chirality can also arise from a chiral axis (atropisomerism) or a chiral plane.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system where the two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond. All four positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') have large, bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃).\n    *   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** In such substituted biphenyls, the bulky groups prevent the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This locked conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral due to a phenomenon called atropisomerism (a form of axial chirality) and will exhibit optical isomerism. All candidate answers that provide detailed reasoning agree on this point.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate, its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Careful Point (Chiral Center):** We must check for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** We must check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the central carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.

A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from a lack of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond. Normally, there is free rotation around this bond. However, this compound has bulky substituents (nitro groups, -NO₂, and dimethyl carboxylate groups, -COOCH₃) at all four *ortho*-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). These large groups sterically hinder each other, preventing the two rings from rotating freely and becoming coplanar. This restricted rotation, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation that lacks a plane of symmetry. As a result, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    A carbon atom bonded to four distinct substituents is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). The presence of this single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the central carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and possesses both a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and a **center of inversion** (at the midpoint of the C=C double bond). The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral and thus not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, we must analyze each molecule for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from the presence of a chiral center or other elements of chirality like a chiral axis, and the absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of each compound:**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a biphenyl derivative where the two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism)**: In biphenyl systems, bulky substituents at the ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') can prevent the two rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can lock the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has bulky nitro groups (-NO₂) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃) at all four ortho-positions. This creates significant steric hindrance, preventing the rings from becoming coplanar. The resulting stable, twisted structure lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure**: Also known as methyl lactate, its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Careful Point (Chiral Center)**: We must check for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Analysis**: The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.

This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, it possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Decision**:\nBased on the analysis, only compounds 1 (due to atropisomerism) and 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism.

A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from the absence of any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This molecule consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single bond. All four positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with bulky groups (two nitro groups and two dimethyl carboxylate groups).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The large size of these substituents creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure**: Also known as methyl lactate, its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We must check for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to:\n        1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure**: Its formula is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It has a central carbonyl group attached to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule does not have a chiral center. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond. It possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Due to these elements of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, only compounds **1** and **2** are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct option.\n\n**Objective**: Identify which of the listed compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Core Principle**: A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key indicators for chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Common structural features leading to chirality include chiral centers and axial chirality (e.g., atropisomerism).\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structural Feature**: This is a biphenyl molecule with substituents at all four *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism)**: The presence of bulky groups (nitro -NO₂ and dimethyl carboxylate -COOCH₃) at these positions creates significant steric hindrance. This prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond, locking them into a non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This restricted rotation creates a chiral axis. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism. All candidate answers with detailed reasoning correctly identify this.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structural Feature**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Careful Point (Chiral Center)**: We must check for carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since the four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is chiral and therefore optically active. All candidate answers with detailed reasoning correctly identify this.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structural Feature**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   **Careful Point (Symmetry)**: We must check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism. All candidate answers with detailed reasoning correctly identify this.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structural Feature**: This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate.\n    *   **Careful Point (Symmetry)**: The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is not optically active. All candidate answers with detailed reasoning correctly identify this.\n\n**Final Synthesis:**\n*   Compound 1 is optically active.\n*   Compound 2 is optically active.\n*   Compound 3 is not optically active.\n*   Compound 4 is not optically active.\n\nThe set of optically active compounds is {1, 2}. This corresponds to option C.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while the chemical reasoning is almost universally correct in identifying compounds 1 and 2 as active, several answers make a final error in selecting the corresponding letter. The agents that correctly match their sound reasoning to the final option (Answers 3, 4, 6, 12, 15) all select C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine which compounds show optical isomerism, we must assess each molecule for chirality. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of a chiral center or an element of axial chirality (like in atropisomers) are common reasons for a molecule to be chiral, provided it does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a biphenyl system, where two benzene rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism)**: The key feature is the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and dimethyl carboxylate groups) at all four *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). These large groups sterically hinder free rotation around the single bond connecting the rings.\n    *   **Analysis**: This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. This specific type of chirality arising from hindered rotation is called atropisomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure**: Also known as methyl lactate, its formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Careful Point (Chiral Center)**: We must check for carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Analysis**: The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure**: (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   **Careful Point (Symmetry)**: We must check for elements of symmetry.\n    *   **Analysis**: The molecule has no chiral centers.

Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate.\n    *   **Careful Point (Symmetry)**: This is a planar molecule.\n    *   **Analysis**: The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of a center of inversion (or a plane of symmetry) makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Decision**:\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not. Therefore, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, we must analyze the structure of each molecule for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from the presence of a chiral center or other elements of chirality, such as a chiral axis, and the absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system where two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond. All four positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with bulky groups (two nitro groups and two dimethyl carboxylate groups).\n    *   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** In such substituted biphenyls, the large size of the ortho-substituents creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Analysis:** This locked conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. As a result, the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, a form of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate, its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Careful Point (Chiral Center):** We must check for carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center. A molecule containing a single chiral center is inherently chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** Its chemical formula is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl group attached to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** We need to check for elements of symmetry.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule does not have a chiral center.

Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid.\n    *   **Careful Point (Symmetry in Geometric Isomers):** We must check for symmetry elements in this *trans*-alkene.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond. The presence of a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nBased on the analysis, only compounds **1** (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and **2** (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism.
