The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties (Radius R_star, Temperature T_star), the planet's albedo (A), and its distance from the star (semi-major axis, a). The relationship is:\nT_eq ∝ (1 - A)¹/⁴ * (1/√a)\n\nSince the problem states that both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms for the star's properties and the albedo are constant for both planets and will cancel out in a ratio. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n**3. Relate Observational Data to the Semi-Major Axis (a)**\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) for each planet. The Doppler shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity, so the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max).\nK ∝ Δλ_max\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, 'a':\n√a ∝ M_p / K\na ∝ (M_p / K)²\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\nUsing the proportionality from the previous step, we can set up the ratio:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / K₂)² / (M_p1 / K₁)²\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**5. Substitute Known Values into the Ratios**\n*   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n    M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K₁ / K₂):**\n    This is proportional to the Doppler shift ratio (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂).\n    Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**6. Calculate the Semi-Major Axis Ratio (a₂ / a₁)**\nSubstitute the mass and velocity ratios into the equation from Step 4:\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio (T_eq1 / T_eq2)**\nSubstitute the semi-major axis ratio back into the equation from Step 2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.536.

Understand the Goal:**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Relationship:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star (semi-major axis, 'a'). For two planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the relationship is:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\nTherefore, the ratio of their temperatures is:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n**3. Radial Velocity (RV) and Orbital Parameters:**\nThe radial velocity method measures the \"wobble\" of a star caused by an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of this velocity (K) for a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\n**4. Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio (a₂ / a₁):**\nWe can rearrange the RV formula to solve for 'a':\n√a ≈ (M_p / K) * √(G / M_star)\na ≈ (M_p / K)² * (G / M_star)\n\nNow, we can create a ratio for a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (M_p2 / K₂)² * (G / M_star) ] / [ (M_p1 / K₁)² * (G / M_star) ]\n\nThe terms (G / M_star) cancel out, leaving:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**5. Relating Doppler Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity (K):**\nThe Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (v_r), based on the formula Δλ/λ₀ = v_r/c. Therefore, the ratio of the maximum radial velocities (K₁/K₂) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts (Δλ₁/Δλ₂).\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**6. Combining the Formulas:**\nSubstitute the result from step 5 into the equation from step 4:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, substitute this into the temperature ratio equation from step 2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √[ (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n**7. Calculation:**\nPlug in the given values:\n*   Mass ratio (M_p2 / M_p1) = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5/7\n*   Doppler shift ratio (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂) = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\nNow, calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n**8.

The extraneous information (star's mass, radius, temperature, and planets' radii) is not needed for the ratio calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Relationship\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties (Radius R_star, Temperature T_star), the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`), and its albedo (A). The formula is:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n\nTo find the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star, we have:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]`\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, all terms cancel out except for the semi-major axis `a`. The equation simplifies to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1/a1)^(1/2) / (1/a2)^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)`\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n### 3. Relating Observational Data to the Semi-Major Axis\nThe problem provides the radial velocity (RV) data in the form of Doppler shifts (Δλ). The RV semi-amplitude, K, is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift, Δλ_max.\n`K ∝ Δλ_max`\nTherefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n`K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4`\n\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n(This assumes the planet's mass, M_p, is much smaller than the star's mass, M_star, and that the orbital inclination is close to 90°, which is a safe assumption for a system detected by both transit and RV methods).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to express the semi-major axis `a` in terms of the other variables:\n`K² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)`\n`a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes\nNow we can set up the ratio for `a2 / a1`:\n`a2 / a1 = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K2²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K1²) ]`\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` are the same for both and cancel out:\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) * (K1² / M_p1²)`\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²`\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nWe have the necessary ratios:\n*   Mass ratio: `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n*   RV semi-amplitude ratio: `K1 / K2 = 3 / 4`\n\nSubstitute these into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n`a2 / a1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784`\n\nNow, substitute this result back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe result is closest to option C.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The problem provides a lot of extraneous information (star's mass, radius, temperature, planets' radii, and the specific wavelength of the spectral line). This is common in physics problems to test the understanding of which variables are relevant. As shown in the derivation, these values cancel out when calculating the ratio.\n*   The relationship between equilibrium temperature and semi-major axis is `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`.\n*   The relationship between RV semi-amplitude, planet mass, and semi-major axis is `K ∝ M_p / √a`.\n*   Combining these relationships leads to the final formula: `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)`. It is crucial to keep the indices (1 and 2) in the correct positions.\n*   The Doppler shift `Δλ` is directly proportional to the radial velocity `K`, so the ratio `K1/K2` is equal to the ratio `Δλ1/Δλ2`.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most derived the correct formula, several made errors in selecting the final option. The correct calculation consistently yields a value of approximately 0.536.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided answers.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Identify Key Information and Formulas**\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity (L_star) and the planet's distance from the star (semi-major axis, `a`). The formula is:\n    T_eq ∝ (L_star / a²)^(1/4)\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, L_star is constant. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n    This means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n*   **Radial Velocity (RV) Semi-amplitude (K):** The RV method measures the wobble of the star caused by the planet's gravity. For a circular orbit (as stated in the problem) and assuming the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n    Where G is the gravitational constant.\n    Since G and M_star are constant for both planets, we can establish the proportionality:\n    K ∝ M_p / √a\n\n*   **Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The observed Doppler shift is directly proportional to the radial velocity. Therefore, the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts is equal to the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n*   **Step A: Express the temperature ratio in terms of the semi-major axes.**\n    As derived above, since the star and albedo are the same for both planets:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n*   **Step B: Relate the semi-major axis to the given quantities.**\n    From the RV semi-amplitude proportionality, K ∝ M_p / √a.\n    We can rearrange this to solve for √a:\n    √a ∝ M_p / K\n    So, for our two planets:\n    √a₁ ∝ M_p1 / K₁\n    √a₂ ∝ M_p2 / K₂\n\n*   **Step C: Find the ratio √(a₂ / a₁).**\n    √(a₂ / a₁) = (√a₂) / (√a₁) = (M_p2 / K₂) / (M_p1 / K₁)\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    √(a₂ / a₁) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)\n\n*   **Step D: Combine the equations.**\n    From Step A and Step C, we get:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)\n\n*   **Step E: Substitute the Doppler shift ratio for the RV semi-amplitude ratio.**\n    Since K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂, the final formula is:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\n*   **Given values:**\n    *   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    *   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\n*   **Calculate the ratios:**\n    *   Mass ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n*   **Calculate the final temperature ratio:**\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n**5. Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option A.\n\n**Careful Points & Analysis of Agent Answers:**\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii and the specific wavelength of the spectral line. As shown in the derivation, these values are not needed to calculate the *ratio* of the temperatures, as they cancel out. This is a common feature in physics problems to test understanding of the underlying principles.\n*   **Assumptions:** The derivation relies on the assumption that the orbital inclination `i` is the same for both planets, or that sin(i) ≈ 1 for both. The problem states that both planets were detected by the transit method, which makes this a very strong and reasonable assumption, as transits are only observable for inclinations very close to 90°.\n*   **Consistency of Agent Calculations:** Most of the provided answers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10) arrive at the same numerical result of ~0.536. This shows a strong consensus on the correct physical formulas and calculation steps.\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Choice:** Several agents (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8) calculate the correct numerical value but select the wrong lettered option. This is likely due to a variation in the option lettering (e.g., A, B, C, D) they were presented with. However, their reasoning and calculation are sound.\n*   **Correctly Matched Answers:** Agents 4, 7, and 10 correctly perform the calculation and match the result (~0.53) to the correct option letter (A).\n\nBased on the consistent calculation across the majority of the agents and a careful step-by-step analysis, the correct numerical answer is ~0.536, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 to Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Relationship\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties (Radius R_star, Temperature T_star), the planet's albedo (A), and its distance from the star (semi-major axis, a). The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a))\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we can write:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, all terms cancel out except for the semi-major axis 'a'.\n\nThe simplified relationship is:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a₂/a₁.\n\n### 3. Radial Velocity and Orbital Parameters\nThe radial velocity (RV) method provides information about the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K), which is caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. For a circular orbit, and assuming the planet's mass (M_p) is much less than the star's mass (M_star), the formula is:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere G is the gravitational constant. The problem states that the planets were detected by the transit method, which implies the orbital inclination is close to 90 degrees (sin(i) ≈ 1), validating the use of this formula.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ₀), where c and λ₀ are constants. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n### 4. Deriving the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nWe can rearrange the radial velocity formula to express the semi-major axis 'a' in terms of the other variables:\nK ∝ M_p / √a\n√a ∝ M_p / K\na ∝ (M_p / K)²\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio for a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / K₂)² / (M_p1 / K₁)²\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 5. Calculation\nWe can now substitute the given values into the derived formulas.\n\n*   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n    M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **Radial Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K₁ / K₂):**\n    Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n*   **Semi-Major Axis Ratio (a₂ / a₁):**\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n    a₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio (T_eq1 / T_eq2):**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n### 6.

The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we can set up the following equation:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, all terms cancel out except for the semi-major axis 'a'. The equation simplifies to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n**3. Relate Observational Data to the Semi-Major Axis**\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method. The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and G is the gravitational constant. (We assume sin(i) ≈ 1 because the planets are detected by the transit method, implying an edge-on orbit).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, 'a':\n√a ∝ M_p / K\na ∝ (M_p / K)²\n\n**4. Determine the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\nUsing the proportionality from the previous step:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / K₂)² / (M_p₁ / K₁)²\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**5. Connect Doppler Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity (K)**\nThe Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (K). Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**6. Combine the Formulas**\nSubstitute the expression for a₂ / a₁ from step 4 into the temperature ratio equation from step 2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √[ (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)² ]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (K₁ / K₂)\n\nNow, substitute the Doppler shift ratio from step 5:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n**7. Perform the Calculation**\nUsing the values given in the problem:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n**8. Conclusion**\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. This value is closest to option C.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while most agents correctly derived the formula and calculated the value of ~0.536, several made errors in selecting the final corresponding letter option. The calculation is robust and consistently points to ~0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem and determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2. This ratio is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties (Temperature T_star, Radius R_star), the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis 'a'), and its albedo (A). The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a))\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio**\nWe can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets as:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both. It also states that they have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, all terms except the semi-major axis 'a' cancel out.\n\nThe simplified ratio is:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, a₂/a₁.\n\n**4. Relate Radial Velocity (RV) Data to Semi-Major Axis**\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude (K) of a star, induced by an orbiting planet of mass M_p in a circular orbit, is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n(This formula assumes the planet's mass is much less than the star's mass, M_p << M_star, and the orbital inclination `i` is close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1. The detection by both transit and RV methods makes this a very strong assumption).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to express the semi-major axis 'a' in terms of K and M_p:\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nNow we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) / (M_p₁² / K₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**6. Substitute Observational Data**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift Δλ (since K = c * Δλ / λ₀, and c and λ₀ are constants). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is equal to the ratio of the Δλ values.\n\nGiven values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nCalculate the required ratios:\n*   Mass ratio: M_p₂ / M_p₁ = 5 / 7\n*   RV ratio: K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)² = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\nFinally, substitute the value of a₂ / a₁ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 3:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √225 / √784 = 15 / 28\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53. Comparing this to the options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n*Self-Correction/Alternative Path:*\nA more direct derivation combines the proportionalities:\n1. T_eq ∝ 1/√a  =>  T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂/a₁)\n2. K ∝ M_p / √a  =>  √a ∝ M_p / K\n3. So, √(a₂/a₁) = (M_p2 / K₂) / (M_p1 / K₁) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)\n4. Therefore, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)\n5. Plugging in the values: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5/7) * (0.03/0.04) = (5/7) * (3/4) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357.\nThis confirms the previous result.\n\nThe final answer is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.

Equilibrium Temperature Relationship**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star. For a given star and assuming the same albedo (A) for both planets, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`).\n\nThe formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet 1 ($T_{eq1}$) and Planet 2 ($T_{eq2}$), we can write:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{R_{star} / (2a_1)}}{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{R_{star} / (2a_2)}}$\n\nSince the planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), the equation simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n**2. Radial Velocity and Orbital Parameters**\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the wobble of a star caused by an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of this velocity (K) for a circular orbit is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n(This assumes the planet's mass, $M_p$, is much smaller than the star's mass, $M_{star}$, and the orbital inclination is close to 90°, which is a reasonable assumption for a transiting planet).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to express the semi-major axis (`a`) in terms of the other variables:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K}$\n$a \\propto \\left(\\frac{M_p}{K}\\right)^2$\n\n**3. Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the proportionality from Step 2, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{(M_{p2}/K_2)^2}{(M_{p1}/K_1)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**4. Relating Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity**\nThe Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($v_r$). Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n**5. Calculation**\nNow we can substitute the known values into the equations.\n\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ M_earth}}{7 \\text{ M_earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio (and thus RV semi-amplitude ratio): $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nFirst, calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nNow, use this ratio to find the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the provided answers shows a strong consensus on the calculation method, even though the final letter choice varies. The correct approach involves relating the equilibrium temperature to the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis) and then relating that distance to the given observational data (planet mass and radial velocity shift).\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the star's properties (Radius $R_{star}$, Temperature $T_{star}$), the planet's albedo ($A$), and its semi-major axis ($a$). The relationship is $T_{eq} \\propto \\sqrt{R_{star}/a}$. Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:\n    $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2} = \\sqrt{a_2 / a_1}$\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity and Semi-Major Axis**: The radial velocity (RV) method measures the wobble of the star caused by the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of this velocity ($K$) for a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, and G is the gravitational constant. This can be rearranged to show the relationship between the semi-major axis, the planet's mass, and the RV semi-amplitude:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n3.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: Using the relationship from step 2, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Relating Doppler Shift to RV Amplitude**: The observed Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($K$). Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n5.  **Combining the Equations**: We can now substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio (from step 3) into the temperature ratio equation (from step 1):\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\n6.  **Calculation**: Now, we insert the given values into the final equation:\n    *   Mass ratio ($M_{p2} / M_{p1}$) = 5 / 7\n    *   Doppler shift ratio ($K_1 / K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~ 1.05\n    B) ~ 0.53\n    C) ~ 1.30\n    D) ~ 0.98\n\nThe result is closest to option B. The extraneous information, such as the star's mass, radius, temperature, and the planets' radii, is not needed to solve for the ratio.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, denoted as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties (its effective temperature, T_star, and radius, R_star), the planet's distance from the star (semi-major axis, a), and the planet's albedo (A). The relationship is:\nT_eq ∝ T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / a)\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we can write:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / a₁)] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / a₂)]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same for both) and have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, all terms cancel out except for the semi-major axis 'a'. The equation simplifies to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis means the ratio of the temperatures is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes. To solve the problem, we need to find the ratio a₂ / a₁.\n\n**3. Radial Velocity and Semi-Major Axis**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude (K) induced by a planet on its star is given by the formula (for a circular orbit and assuming the planet's mass, M_p, is much less than the star's mass, M_star):\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere G is the gravitational constant. The problem states the planets were also detected by the transit method, which implies the orbital inclination is close to 90 degrees (sin(i) ≈ 1), validating the use of this formula.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to express the semi-major axis 'a' in terms of the other variables:\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\nUsing the expression for 'a', we can form the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) / (M_p₁² / K₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratios of Mass and Radial Velocity**\nThe problem gives us the necessary values:\n*   Mass ratio: M_p₂ / M_p₁ = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5/7\n*   The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n**6. Substitute and Solve**\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equations from the previous steps.\n\nFirst, find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\na₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\nNext, use this ratio to find the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √(225 / 784)\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √225 / √784 = 15 / 28\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculation consistently yields a result of approximately 0.536.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown to confirm the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the stellar luminosity and its distance from the star (semi-major axis, $a$). For two planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo (A), the formula for the equilibrium temperature ratio simplifies to:\n    $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2} = \\sqrt{a_2 / a_1}$\n    This is because all other factors, such as the star's radius and temperature, and the planets' albedos, cancel out in the ratio.\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity and Orbital Parameters**: The radial velocity (RV) method measures the wobble of the star caused by an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of this velocity (K) for a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, $P$ is the orbital period, $i$ is the orbital inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n    Using Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3$), we can substitute the period $P$ with the semi-major axis $a$. This leads to the relationship:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    (This assumes $M_{star}$ is constant and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, which is a safe assumption for transiting planets).\n\n3.  **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**: From the relationship $K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$, we can rearrange to find $\\sqrt{a} \\propto M_p / K$.

    "An analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the physical principles and the final numerical result, despite some confusion in matching the result to the correct lettered option. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the correct approach.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Relationship:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the energy it receives from its star. For two planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's semi-major axis (`a`).\n    *   `T_eq ∝ 1 / √a`\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures is: `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)`\n\n3.  **Radial Velocity (RV) Relationship:** The RV method measures the star's wobble. The semi-amplitude of this velocity (`K`) is proportional to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (`a`).\n    *   `K ∝ M_p / √a`\n    *   The problem provides the maximum Doppler shift (`Δλ`), which is directly proportional to `K`. Thus, we can use `Δλ` as a proxy for `K` in ratios: `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n\n4.  **Derive the Final Equation:** We need to find `√(a₂ / a₁)`. We can rearrange the RV relationship to solve for `√a`:\n    *   `√a ∝ M_p / K`\n    *   Now we can form the ratio `√(a₂ / a₁)`:\n        `√(a₂ / a₁) = (√a₂) / (√a₁) = (M_p2 / K₂) / (M_p1 / K₁) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)`\n    *   Substituting this back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2 gives:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)`\n    *   Finally, replacing the `K` ratio with the `Δλ` ratio:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:** Substitute the given values into the derived formula:\n    *   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p1) = 7 Earth masses\n    *   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p2) = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    *   A) ~ 0.53\n    *   B) ~ 1.05\n    *   C) ~ 1.30\n    *   D) ~ 0.98\n\n    The calculated value is closest to 0.53.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides a significant amount of information that is not needed for the final calculation (star's mass, radius, temperature; planets' radii; the specific wavelength of the spectral line). These values would be required to find the absolute temperatures but cancel out when calculating a ratio. This is a common technique to test understanding of the underlying physics.\n*   **Correct Indices:** It is crucial to keep track of which planet is \"1\" and which is \"2\" throughout the derivation to avoid inverting any of the ratios. The final formula `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)` correctly reflects the inverse and direct relationships.\n*   **Assumptions:** The derivation relies on the planets having circular orbits (stated in the problem) and orbital inclinations close to 90 degrees. The fact that they were detected by both the transit and RV methods makes the assumption of an edge-on orbit (`sin(i) ≈ 1`) very reliable.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties (Radius R_star, Temperature T_star), the planet's albedo (A), and its distance from the star (semi-major axis, a). The relationship is:\nT_eq ∝ (1 - A)¹/⁴ * (1/√a)\n\nSince the problem states that both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms for the star's properties and the albedo are constant for both planets and will cancel out in a ratio. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n**3. Relate Observational Data to the Semi-Major Axis (a)**\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) for each planet. The Doppler shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity, so the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max).\nK ∝ Δλ_max\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, 'a':\n√a ∝ M_p / K\na ∝ (M_p / K)²\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\nUsing the proportionality from the previous step, we can set up the ratio:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / K₂)² / (M_p1 / K₁)²\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**5.

Understand the Goal:**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Relationship:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star (semi-major axis, 'a'). For two planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the relationship is:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\nTherefore, the ratio of their temperatures is:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n**3. Radial Velocity (RV) and Orbital Parameters:**\nThe radial velocity method measures the \"wobble\" of a star caused by an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of this velocity (K) for a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\n**4.

Relating Doppler Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity (K):**\nThe Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (v_r), based on the formula Δλ/λ₀ = v_r/c. Therefore, the ratio of the maximum radial velocities (K₁/K₂) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts (Δλ₁/Δλ₂).\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**6. Combining the Formulas:**\nSubstitute the result from step 5 into the equation from step 4:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, substitute this into the temperature ratio equation from step 2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √[ (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n**7.

Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Relationship\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties (Radius R_star, Temperature T_star), the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`), and its albedo (A). The formula is:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n\nTo find the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star, we have:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]`\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, all terms cancel out except for the semi-major axis `a`. The equation simplifies to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1/a1)^(1/2) / (1/a2)^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)`\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n### 3. Relating Observational Data to the Semi-Major Axis\nThe problem provides the radial velocity (RV) data in the form of Doppler shifts (Δλ). The RV semi-amplitude, K, is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift, Δλ_max.\n`K ∝ Δλ_max`\nTherefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n`K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4`\n\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n(This assumes the planet's mass, M_p, is much smaller than the star's mass, M_star, and that the orbital inclination is close to 90°, which is a safe assumption for a system detected by both transit and RV methods).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to express the semi-major axis `a` in terms of the other variables:\n`K² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)`\n`a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes\nNow we can set up the ratio for `a2 / a1`:\n`a2 / a1 = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K2²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K1²) ]`\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` are the same for both and cancel out:\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) * (K1² / M_p1²)`\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²`\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nWe have the necessary ratios:\n*   Mass ratio: `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n*   RV semi-amplitude ratio: `K1 / K2 = 3 / 4`\n\nSubstitute these into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n`a2 / a1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784`\n\nNow, substitute this result back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n### 6.

Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe result is closest to option C.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The problem provides a lot of extraneous information (star's mass, radius, temperature, planets' radii, and the specific wavelength of the spectral line). This is common in physics problems to test the understanding of which variables are relevant. As shown in the derivation, these values cancel out when calculating the ratio.\n*   The relationship between equilibrium temperature and semi-major axis is `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`.\n*   The relationship between RV semi-amplitude, planet mass, and semi-major axis is `K ∝ M_p / √a`.\n*   Combining these relationships leads to the final formula: `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)`. It is crucial to keep the indices (1 and 2) in the correct positions.\n*   The Doppler shift `Δλ` is directly proportional to the radial velocity `K`, so the ratio `K1/K2` is equal to the ratio `Δλ1/Δλ2`.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most derived the correct formula, several made errors in selecting the final option. The correct calculation consistently yields a value of approximately 0.536.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided answers.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Identify Key Information and Formulas**\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity (L_star) and the planet's distance from the star (semi-major axis, `a`). The formula is:\n    T_eq ∝ (L_star / a²)^(1/4)\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, L_star is constant. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n    This means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n*   **Radial Velocity (RV) Semi-amplitude (K):** The RV method measures the wobble of the star caused by the planet's gravity. For a circular orbit (as stated in the problem) and assuming the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n    Where G is the gravitational constant.\n    Since G and M_star are constant for both planets, we can establish the proportionality:\n    K ∝ M_p / √a\n\n*   **Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The observed Doppler shift is directly proportional to the radial velocity. Therefore, the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts is equal to the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n*   **Step A: Express the temperature ratio in terms of the semi-major axes.**\n    As derived above, since the star and albedo are the same for both planets:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n*   **Step B: Relate the semi-major axis to the given quantities.**\n    From the RV semi-amplitude proportionality, K ∝ M_p / √a.\n    We can rearrange this to solve for √a:\n    √a ∝ M_p / K\n    So, for our two planets:\n    √a₁ ∝ M_p1 / K₁\n    √a₂ ∝ M_p2 / K₂\n\n*   **Step C: Find the ratio √(a₂ / a₁).**\n    √(a₂ / a₁) = (√a₂) / (√a₁) = (M_p2 / K₂) / (M_p1 / K₁)\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    √(a₂ / a₁) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)\n\n*   **Step D: Combine the equations.**\n    From Step A and Step C, we get:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)\n\n*   **Step E: Substitute the Doppler shift ratio for the RV semi-amplitude ratio.**\n    Since K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂, the final formula is:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n**4.

As shown in the derivation, these values are not needed to calculate the *ratio* of the temperatures, as they cancel out. This is a common feature in physics problems to test understanding of the underlying principles.\n*   **Assumptions:** The derivation relies on the assumption that the orbital inclination `i` is the same for both planets, or that sin(i) ≈ 1 for both. The problem states that both planets were detected by the transit method, which makes this a very strong and reasonable assumption, as transits are only observable for inclinations very close to 90°.\n*   **Consistency of Agent Calculations:** Most of the provided answers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10) arrive at the same numerical result of ~0.536. This shows a strong consensus on the correct physical formulas and calculation steps.\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Choice:** Several agents (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8) calculate the correct numerical value but select the wrong lettered option. This is likely due to a variation in the option lettering (e.g., A, B, C, D) they were presented with. However, their reasoning and calculation are sound.\n*   **Correctly Matched Answers:** Agents 4, 7, and 10 correctly perform the calculation and match the result (~0.53) to the correct option letter (A).\n\nBased on the consistent calculation across the majority of the agents and a careful step-by-step analysis, the correct numerical answer is ~0.536, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 to Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Relationship\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties (Radius R_star, Temperature T_star), the planet's albedo (A), and its distance from the star (semi-major axis, a). The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a))\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we can write:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, all terms cancel out except for the semi-major axis 'a'.\n\nThe simplified relationship is:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a₂/a₁.\n\n### 3. Radial Velocity and Orbital Parameters\nThe radial velocity (RV) method provides information about the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K), which is caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. For a circular orbit, and assuming the planet's mass (M_p) is much less than the star's mass (M_star), the formula is:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere G is the gravitational constant. The problem states that the planets were detected by the transit method, which implies the orbital inclination is close to 90 degrees (sin(i) ≈ 1), validating the use of this formula.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ₀), where c and λ₀ are constants. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n### 4. Deriving the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nWe can rearrange the radial velocity formula to express the semi-major axis 'a' in terms of the other variables:\nK ∝ M_p / √a\n√a ∝ M_p / K\na ∝ (M_p / K)²\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio for a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / K₂)² / (M_p1 / K₁)²\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 5. Calculation\nWe can now substitute the given values into the derived formulas.\n\n*   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n    M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **Radial Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K₁ / K₂):**\n    Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n*   **Semi-Major Axis Ratio (a₂ / a₁):**\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n    a₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio (T_eq1 / T_eq2):**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n### 6.

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Relationship**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we can set up the following equation:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, all terms cancel out except for the semi-major axis 'a'. The equation simplifies to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n**3. Relate Observational Data to the Semi-Major Axis**\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method. The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and G is the gravitational constant. (We assume sin(i) ≈ 1 because the planets are detected by the transit method, implying an edge-on orbit).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, 'a':\n√a ∝ M_p / K\na ∝ (M_p / K)²\n\n**4. Determine the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\nUsing the proportionality from the previous step:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / K₂)² / (M_p₁ / K₁)²\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**5. Connect Doppler Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity (K)**\nThe Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (K). Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**6. Combine the Formulas**\nSubstitute the expression for a₂ / a₁ from step 4 into the temperature ratio equation from step 2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √[ (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)² ]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (K₁ / K₂)\n\nNow, substitute the Doppler shift ratio from step 5:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n**7. Perform the Calculation**\nUsing the values given in the problem:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n**8. Conclusion**\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. This value is closest to option C.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while most agents correctly derived the formula and calculated the value of ~0.536, several made errors in selecting the final corresponding letter option. The calculation is robust and consistently points to ~0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem and determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2. This ratio is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties (Temperature T_star, Radius R_star), the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis 'a'), and its albedo (A). The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a))\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio**\nWe can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets as:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both. It also states that they have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, all terms except the semi-major axis 'a' cancel out.\n\nThe simplified ratio is:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, a₂/a₁.\n\n**4. Relate Radial Velocity (RV) Data to Semi-Major Axis**\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude (K) of a star, induced by an orbiting planet of mass M_p in a circular orbit, is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n(This formula assumes the planet's mass is much less than the star's mass, M_p << M_star, and the orbital inclination `i` is close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1. The detection by both transit and RV methods makes this a very strong assumption).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to express the semi-major axis 'a' in terms of K and M_p:\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nNow we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) / (M_p₁² / K₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**6. Substitute Observational Data**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift Δλ (since K = c * Δλ / λ₀, and c and λ₀ are constants). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is equal to the ratio of the Δλ values.\n\nGiven values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nCalculate the required ratios:\n*   Mass ratio: M_p₂ / M_p₁ = 5 / 7\n*   RV ratio: K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)² = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\nFinally, substitute the value of a₂ / a₁ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 3:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √225 / √784 = 15 / 28\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.

T_eq ∝ 1/√a  =>  T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂/a₁)\n2. K ∝ M_p / √a  =>  √a ∝ M_p / K\n3. So, √(a₂/a₁) = (M_p2 / K₂) / (M_p1 / K₁) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)\n4. Therefore, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)\n5. Plugging in the values: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5/7) * (0.03/0.04) = (5/7) * (3/4) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357.\nThis confirms the previous result.\n\nThe final answer is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.

Equilibrium Temperature Relationship**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star. For a given star and assuming the same albedo (A) for both planets, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`).\n\nThe formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet 1 ($T_{eq1}$) and Planet 2 ($T_{eq2}$), we can write:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{R_{star} / (2a_1)}}{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{R_{star} / (2a_2)}}$\n\nSince the planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), the equation simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n**2. Radial Velocity and Orbital Parameters**\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the wobble of a star caused by an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of this velocity (K) for a circular orbit is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n(This assumes the planet's mass, $M_p$, is much smaller than the star's mass, $M_{star}$, and the orbital inclination is close to 90°, which is a reasonable assumption for a transiting planet).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to express the semi-major axis (`a`) in terms of the other variables:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K}$\n$a \\propto \\left(\\frac{M_p}{K}\\right)^2$\n\n**3. Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the proportionality from Step 2, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{(M_{p2}/K_2)^2}{(M_{p1}/K_1)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**4. Relating Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity**\nThe Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($v_r$). Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n**5. Calculation**\nNow we can substitute the known values into the equations.\n\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ M_earth}}{7 \\text{ M_earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio (and thus RV semi-amplitude ratio): $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nFirst, calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nNow, use this ratio to find the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the provided answers shows a strong consensus on the calculation method, even though the final letter choice varies. The correct approach involves relating the equilibrium temperature to the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis) and then relating that distance to the given observational data (planet mass and radial velocity shift).\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the star's properties (Radius $R_{star}$, Temperature $T_{star}$), the planet's albedo ($A$), and its semi-major axis ($a$). The relationship is $T_{eq} \\propto \\sqrt{R_{star}/a}$. Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:\n    $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2} = \\sqrt{a_2 / a_1}$\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity and Semi-Major Axis**: The radial velocity (RV) method measures the wobble of the star caused by the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of this velocity ($K$) for a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, and G is the gravitational constant. This can be rearranged to show the relationship between the semi-major axis, the planet's mass, and the RV semi-amplitude:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n3.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: Using the relationship from step 2, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Relating Doppler Shift to RV Amplitude**: The observed Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($K$). Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n5.  **Combining the Equations**: We can now substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio (from step 3) into the temperature ratio equation (from step 1):\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\n6.  **Calculation**: Now, we insert the given values into the final equation:\n    *   Mass ratio ($M_{p2} / M_{p1}$) = 5 / 7\n    *   Doppler shift ratio ($K_1 / K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~ 1.05\n    B) ~ 0.53\n    C) ~ 1.30\n    D) ~ 0.98\n\nThe result is closest to option B. The extraneous information, such as the star's mass, radius, temperature, and the planets' radii, is not needed to solve for the ratio.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, denoted as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties (its effective temperature, T_star, and radius, R_star), the planet's distance from the star (semi-major axis, a), and the planet's albedo (A). The relationship is:\nT_eq ∝ T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / a)\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we can write:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / a₁)] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / a₂)]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same for both) and have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, all terms cancel out except for the semi-major axis 'a'. The equation simplifies to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis means the ratio of the temperatures is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes. To solve the problem, we need to find the ratio a₂ / a₁.\n\n**3. Radial Velocity and Semi-Major Axis**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude (K) induced by a planet on its star is given by the formula (for a circular orbit and assuming the planet's mass, M_p, is much less than the star's mass, M_star):\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere G is the gravitational constant. The problem states the planets were also detected by the transit method, which implies the orbital inclination is close to 90 degrees (sin(i) ≈ 1), validating the use of this formula.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to express the semi-major axis 'a' in terms of the other variables:\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\nUsing the expression for 'a', we can form the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) / (M_p₁² / K₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratios of Mass and Radial Velocity**\nThe problem gives us the necessary values:\n*   Mass ratio: M_p₂ / M_p₁ = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5/7\n*   The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n**6. Substitute and Solve**\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equations from the previous steps.\n\nFirst, find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\na₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\nNext, use this ratio to find the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √(225 / 784)\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √225 / √784 = 15 / 28\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculation consistently yields a result of approximately 0.536.

Several of the provided candidate answers perform the calculation correctly but make a mistake in selecting the final lettered option.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown to confirm the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the stellar luminosity and its distance from the star (semi-major axis, $a$). For two planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo (A), the formula for the equilibrium temperature ratio simplifies to:\n    $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2} = \\sqrt{a_2 / a_1}$\n    This is because all other factors, such as the star's radius and temperature, and the planets' albedos, cancel out in the ratio.\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity and Orbital Parameters**: The radial velocity (RV) method measures the wobble of the star caused by an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of this velocity (K) for a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, $P$ is the orbital period, $i$ is the orbital inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n    Using Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3$), we can substitute the period $P$ with the semi-major axis $a$. This leads to the relationship:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    (This assumes $M_{star}$ is constant and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, which is a safe assumption for transiting planets).\n\n3.  **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**: From the relationship $K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$, we can rearrange to find $\\sqrt{a} \\propto M_p / K$. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    $\\sqrt{a_2 / a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2} / K_2}{M_{p1} / K_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n4.  **Combining Ratios**: We can now substitute this expression back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n    $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2} = \\sqrt{a_2 / a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n5.  **Calculating the Final Value**: The problem provides the necessary values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $M_{p2} / M_{p1} = 5 / 7$\n    *   The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n        $K_1 / K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.03 \\, \\text{Å} / 0.04 \\, \\text{Å} = 3 / 4$\n\n    Plugging these ratios into the equation:\n    $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2} = (5 / 7) \\times (3 / 4) = 15 / 28$\n\n6.  **Final Result**:\n    $15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The star's mass, radius, effective temperature, the planets' radii, and the specific wavelength of the spectral line are all unnecessary for calculating the *ratio* of the equilibrium temperatures, as these terms cancel out.\n*   **Correct Proportionalities**: The key is correctly identifying that $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$ and $K \\propto M_p/\\sqrt{a}$. Combining these directly yields $T_{eq} \\propto K/M_p$, which leads to the final ratio.\n*   **Index Management**: It is crucial to keep track of which planet is \"1\" and which is \"2\" to avoid inverting the ratios. The question asks for $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n*   **Option Matching**: The calculated value of ~0.536 must be correctly matched to the given options. Several of the provided candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed at this final step.\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a result of approximately 0.536, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
