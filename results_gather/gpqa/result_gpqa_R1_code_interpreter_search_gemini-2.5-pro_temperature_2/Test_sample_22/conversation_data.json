    "*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants and reaction conditions.**\n    *   The first reactant is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let's determine its structure from the IUPAC name.\n        *   The base name is `benzene` with an `oxy` group, so it's a phenoxy group (Ph-O-).\n        *   Attached to the oxygen is a `(2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)` group.\n        *   Let's build this group: The parent chain is `but-` (4 carbons). It's a `-en` so there is a double bond, at position 3 (`-3-en`). It's a `-yl` group attached at position 1 (`-1-yl`).\n        *   Numbering the chain from the attachment point: `C1-C2-C3=C4`.\n        *   So, the chain is `-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2`.\n        *   Now, we add the substituents: `2,2-dimethyl`. These are on carbon 2.\n        *   The final substituent group is `-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2`.\n        *   Therefore, the full structure of the reactant is `Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2`.\n    *   The second reactant is hydrogen bromide (HBr), a strong acid. The reaction is likely acid-catalyzed.\n\n*   **Step 2: Consider the possible reaction mechanisms.**\n    *   The reactant has two main functional groups that can react with HBr: the ether linkage and the alkene double bond.\n    *   Cleavage of the aryl-alkyl ether bond with HBr is possible, but usually requires harsher conditions. It would produce phenol (Ph-OH) and an alkyl bromide. This doesn't directly match the options well.\n    *   Electrophilic addition of HBr across the C=C double bond is a very common reaction and is expected to be fast. The HBr provides a proton (H+) which acts as an electrophile.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the electrophilic addition of H+ to the alkene.**\n    *   The alkene is `...-CH=CH2`. The H+ will add to the double bond to form a carbocation.\n    *   According to Markovnikov's rule, the proton will add to the carbon atom that has more hydrogen atoms. In `-CH=CH2`, the H+ adds to the terminal `CH2`.\n    *   `Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2` + H+  →  `Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-C+H-CH3`\n    *   This generates a secondary carbocation. This carbocation is a key intermediate.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the fate of the carbocation intermediate.**\n    *   The phenyl ring is attached to an oxygen atom (-O-R), which is an activating group and an ortho-, para-director for electrophilic aromatic substitution. The carbocation formed in the side chain is an electrophile. Thus, an intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction can occur.\n    *   The intermediate carbocation has two principal competing reaction pathways, which explains the formation of two products.\n\n*   **Pathway 1: Direct cyclization of the secondary carbocation.**\n    *   The secondary carbocation (`...C+H-CH3`) can directly attack the activated benzene ring at the ortho position.\n    *   Let's count the atoms that will form the new ring: O -> C1 (of the side chain) -> C2 -> C3 (the carbocation) -> C(ortho) of benzene -> C(ipso) of benzene. This forms a 6-membered ring fused to the benzene ring.\n    *   The resulting structure is a chromane (a benzodihydropyran). Let's determine the substituents. The new heterocyclic ring is -O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH(CH3)-.\n    *   Numbering the chromane skeleton (O=1), the C2 position has no substituent, C3 has two methyl groups, and C4 has one methyl group. The product is **3,3,4-trimethylchromane**. This matches the first product in option B.\n\n*   **Pathway 2: Rearrangement followed by cyclization.**\n    *   Carbocations can rearrange to form more stable carbocations. The secondary carbocation `Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-C+H-CH3` is adjacent to a quaternary carbon (`C(CH3)2`).\n    *   A 1,2-methyl shift from the C2 of the chain to the C3 carbocation will occur.\n    *   `Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-C+H-CH3`  →  `Ph-O-CH2-C+(CH3)-CH(CH3)2`\n    *   This rearrangement forms a more stable tertiary carbocation.\n    *   This new tertiary carbocation can now act as the electrophile in an intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation, attacking the ortho-position of the ring.\n    *   Let's count the atoms forming this new ring: O -> C1 (of the chain) -> C2 (the carbocation) -> C(ortho) of benzene -> C(ipso) of benzene. This forms a 5-membered ring.\n    *   The resulting structure is a 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. Let's determine the substituents. The new heterocyclic ring is -O-CH2-C(CH3)(CH(CH3)2)-.\n    *   Numbering the dihydrobenzofuran skeleton (O=1), the C2 position has no substituent, and the C3 position has a methyl group and an isopropyl group (`-CH(CH3)2`). The product is **3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran**. This matches the second product in option B.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate the other options.**\n    *   **A) 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol:** These structures would require a Claisen-type rearrangement and saturation of the double bond, which is inconsistent with the reagent (HBr).\n    *   **C) (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene:** These are products of HBr addition to the double bond without cyclization. While the Markovnikov product (`3-bromo...`) is a plausible intermediate, the anti-Markovnikov product (`4-bromo...`) would require radical conditions (e.g., peroxides), which were not stated. Also, this option ignores the likely intramolecular Friedel-Crafts reaction.\n    *   **D) (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene:** This option combines the unlikely anti-Markovnikov addition product with an elimination product from the rearranged carbocation, which is a mechanistically inconsistent pairing.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The formation of the two products described in option B is perfectly explained by a well-established mechanism involving electrophilic addition of H+ to the alkene, followed by two competing pathways for the resulting carbocation: direct intramolecular cyclization or rearrangement to a more stable carbocation followed by intramolecular cyclization.\n\n<<<B>>>"
