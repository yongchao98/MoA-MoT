    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of electrostatics, specifically concerning conductors and electrostatic shielding.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the spherical conductor, it induces an electric field. Since the electric field inside the material of a conductor must be zero in electrostatic equilibrium, charges within the conductor redistribute to cancel this field. Specifically, a negative charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if you imagine a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material enclosing the cavity, the net electric flux through it must be zero (since $\\vec{E}=0$ inside the conductor). This implies the total charge enclosed by this surface must be zero. Thus, the induced charge on the cavity wall must be `-q` to cancel the `+q` charge placed inside.\n\n2.  **Charge Conservation:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, to conserve the total charge of the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding and Charge Distribution:** A key property of a conductor is that it shields its exterior from the electrostatic effects of charges placed inside a cavity within it. The combined electric field produced by the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall is zero for all points outside the cavity. Consequently, the charge `+q` on the outer surface behaves as if the charges inside the cavity do not exist. Since the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, this `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over the surface to achieve electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's law (or Newton's Shell Theorem for gravitation, which is analogous), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at a single point at the center of the sphere.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. The point P is located at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P is given by the formula for a point charge:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{Q_{outer}}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n\n    Substituting the values:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n    The information provided about the cavity's radius `r`, its displacement from the center `s`, the distance from P to the cavity's center `l`, and the angle `Î¸` are all distractors. They do not affect the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\nComparing our result with the given options, we find that it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
