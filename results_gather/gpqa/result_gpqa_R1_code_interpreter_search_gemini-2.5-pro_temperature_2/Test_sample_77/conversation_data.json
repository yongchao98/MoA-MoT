    "This question asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's break down the derivation and concepts involved.\n\n### 1. Key Concepts\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`.\n*   **Observer:** The potential is measured at a position `r` at time `t`.\n*   **Retardation:** Electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, `c`. The field measured at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**.\n*   **Relationship between times:** The time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observer's position `r` is `|r - s(tr)| / c`. This leads to the retarded time condition:\n    `t = tr + |r - s(tr)| / c`\n\n### 2. Defining the Vectors\n\nThe problem provides a clear notation:\n*   `s(tr)`: Position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `v`: Velocity of the charge `q` at the retarded time `tr`, i.e., `v = d(s(t))/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   `r`: Position of the field observation point.\n*   `d`: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point. So, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n*   `d`: The magnitude of the vector `d`, i.e., `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n\nUsing this notation, the retarded time equation becomes:\n`c(t - tr) = d`\n\n### 3. The Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a time-varying charge distribution `ρ(r', t')` and current distribution `J(r', t')`, the general solutions for the potentials (in the Lorenz gauge) are the retarded potentials:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πεo) ∫ [ρ(r', tr')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μo / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\nFor a point charge, the densities are:\n`ρ(r', t') = q * δ(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ(r' - s(t'))`\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Integrals for a Point Charge\n\nSubstituting the point charge densities into the integral for `V(r, t)` and evaluating it is a standard but non-trivial procedure in electromagnetism. The complication arises because the retarded time `tr'` inside the delta function also depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration is the Liénard-Wiechert potential:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πεo) * [q / (R(1 - n · v/c))]` where `R = |r - s(tr)|` and `n = (r - s(tr))/R`.\n\nLet's translate this into the problem's notation:\n*   `R = d`\n*   `n = d / d`\n*   `n · v = (d/d) · v = (d · v) / d`\n\nSubstituting these into the formula for `V`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πεo) * [q / (d(1 - (d · v)/(dc)))]`\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πεo) * [q / (d - (d · v)/c)]`\n\nTo make it look like the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πεo) * [qc / (dc - d · v)]`\nThis is the **Liénard-Wiechert scalar potential**.\n\n### 5. The Vector Potential\n\nThe vector potential `A(r, t)` can be found similarly by integrating the expression for the current density. However, a simpler method is to use the relationship between `A` and `V` for a single point charge:\n`A(r, t) = (v / c²) * V(r, t)`\n\nSubstituting our expression for `V(r, t)`:\n`A(r, t) = (v / c²) * (qc / (4πεo(dc - d · v)))`\n\nNow, we use the fundamental relation `c² = 1 / (μo εo)`, which implies that `1 / (εo c²) = μo`.\n`A(r, t) = (μo / (4π)) * (qcv / (dc - d · v))`\n`A(r, t) = (μo qc v) / (4π(dc - d · v))`\nThis is the **Liénard-Wiechert vector potential**.\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's compare our derived potentials with the given choices:\n\n*   **A)** Incorrect. These are non-relativistic forms and ignore retardation.\n*   **B)** Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong (`+` instead of `-`).\n*   **C)** `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`\n    *   The expression for `V` matches our derived scalar potential.\n    *   The expression for `A` matches our derived vector potential.\n    This option is correct.\n*   **D)** Incorrect. `V` is the simple Coulomb potential, and the expression for `A` is dimensionally and vectorially wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
