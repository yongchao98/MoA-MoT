    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM), organized as an expansion in powers of 1/Λ, where Λ is the scale of new physics. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian respects the fundamental principles of quantum field theory and the observed symmetries of the Standard Model itself.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** The SMEFT is a relativistic quantum field theory. As such, it is fundamentally required to be invariant under Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations). This ensures that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is the full spacetime symmetry group of special relativity, which includes Lorentz transformations as well as spacetime translations. Since the Lagrangian density in a local quantum field theory is a Lorentz scalar and does not depend explicitly on spacetime coordinates (to ensure conservation of energy-momentum), it must be invariant under the full Poincare group. All operators in the SMEFT are constructed to be Poincare invariant.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P). It is known that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, most famously in the weak interactions involving quarks (seen in the CKM matrix). Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it naturally contains the SM's CP violation. Furthermore, higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT can introduce new sources of CP violation. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories. It states that any such theory is automatically symmetric under the combined action of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. All operators in the SMEFT are CPT-invariant.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n-   Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n-   Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected.\n-   CP symmetry (3) is not required to be respected.\n-   CPT symmetry (4) must be respected.\n\nThe correct set of required symmetries is {1, 2, 4}.\n\n<<<B>>>"
