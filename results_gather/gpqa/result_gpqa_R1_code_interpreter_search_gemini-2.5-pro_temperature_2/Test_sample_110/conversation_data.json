    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1 Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, bulky base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction. A strong base deprotonates the alpha-carbon of a carbonyl compound to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (the Michael acceptor).\n\n**Step 1: Enolate Formation**\n1.  The substrate is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n2.  The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3), so it has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen atom, C1, and C5), so it has **one α-proton**.\n3.  The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the only available α-proton at the C6 position to form a nucleophilic enolate. The steric bulk of t-BuOK is not a deciding factor here as there is only one possible site for deprotonation.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition)**\n1.  The enolate formed at C6 will attack the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`).\n2.  The nucleophilic attack occurs at the β-carbon (the `CH2` group) of ethyl acrylate, which is electron-deficient due to conjugation with the ester group.\n3.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n**Step 3: Protonation**\n1.  The intermediate anion formed after the attack is protonated (e.g., by tert-butanol formed in the first step or during aqueous workup) to yield the final neutral product.\n2.  The new substituent attached to C6 is `-CH2CH2COOEt`.\n\n**Step 4: Naming the Product (A)**\n1.  The question provides product names where the propanoate chain is considered the parent molecule, and the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent.\n2.  The product is named as an `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`. This means the cyclohexyl ring is attached to carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n3.  We need to name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the ring is numbered starting from the point of attachment to the parent chain.\n    *   **C1'**: The point of attachment (originally C6 of the ketone). It has a **methyl** group.\n    *   **C2'**: The adjacent carbon with the carbonyl group (originally C1). It is an **oxo** group.\n    *   **C3'**: The next carbon (originally C2). It has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n4.  Putting the substituent name together in alphabetical order: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n5.  Therefore, the full name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches options A and C.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction 2 Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2CH2NO2`) and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3CH=CHCN`, also known as crotononitrile).\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) and water (H2O).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is another Michael addition. The α-protons of a nitroalkane are acidic and can be removed by a base to form a nitronate anion, which is a good Michael donor.\n\n**Step 1: Carbanion (Nitronate) Formation**\n1.  The substrate is 1-nitropropane. The protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the `-NO2` group) are acidic (pKa ≈ 10).\n2.  The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nucleophilic nitronate anion: `[CH3CH2CHNO2]⁻`.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition)**\n1.  The nitronate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`).\n2.  The attack occurs at the β-carbon of the nitrile (the `CH` group bonded to the methyl group), which is electron-deficient due to conjugation with the nitrile (`-CN`) group.\n3.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n\n**Step 3: Protonation**\n1.  The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final neutral product.\n2.  The resulting structure is: `(CH3CH2)(NO2)CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`\n\n**Step 4: Naming the Product (B)**\n1.  The principal functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`), so the parent chain is a nitrile.\n2.  We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n    `NC-C2H2-C3H(CH3)-C4H(NO2)-C5H2-C6H3`\n3.  The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n4.  Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   A **methyl** group is on **C3**.\n    *   A **nitro** group is on **C4**.\n5.  The full name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches options A and B.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This eliminates options B and D.\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`. This eliminates options C and D.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products A and B is **Option A**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
