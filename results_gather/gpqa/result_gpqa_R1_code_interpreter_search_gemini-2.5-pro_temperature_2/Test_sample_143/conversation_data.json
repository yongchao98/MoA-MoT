    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem of finding the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics Principles\n\nThe problem asks for the **mean decay distance** ($L$) of a relativistic particle. This involves combining concepts from special relativity and particle physics.\n\n*   **Mean Lifetime at Rest ($\\tau_0$):** A particle's instability is characterized by its decay width ($\\Gamma$). The mean lifetime in its own rest frame is related to the decay width by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The particle is produced with high energy ($E_X = 8$ GeV) compared to its mass ($m_X = 1.2$ GeV), which means it travels at a relativistic speed (close to the speed of light, $c$). Due to time dilation, its lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) will be longer than its lifetime at rest. The two are related by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n    $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\n*   **Mean Decay Distance:** The mean distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before decaying is its speed ($v$) multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$):\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n\n### 2. Formulate the Calculation\n\nCombining the principles above, we can derive a single formula for the mean decay distance $L$.\n\n1.  Start with $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n2.  Substitute $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$:\n    $L = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\n3.  Substitute $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma$:\n    $L = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n4.  It's convenient to work with the particle's velocity as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = v/c$. So, $v = \\beta c$.\n    $L = \\beta c \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = \\beta \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\nThe term $\\beta\\gamma$ can be calculated from the particle's energy ($E_X$) and mass ($m_X$). From the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n*   $E_X = \\gamma m_X c^2$\n*   $p c = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\n*   Also, $p = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X (\\beta c)$\n\nFrom the last two points, we can express $\\beta\\gamma$ as:\n$\\beta \\gamma = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the formula for $L$:\n$L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nThis formula is very convenient as it uses the given energy, mass, and decay width directly.\n\n### 3. Perform the Calculation using a Python Script\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a Python script. We will use the following standard physical constants:\n*   Reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar = 6.582119569 \\times 10^{-22}$ MeV·s\n*   Speed of light, $c = 299792458$ m/s\n*   A useful combination is $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327$ MeV·fm, where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m.\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Define the given values, making sure the units are consistent (we will use MeV for energy).\n2.  Calculate the term $\\beta\\gamma$ (or $pc/mc^2$).\n3.  Calculate the mean lifetime in the rest frame, $\\tau_0$.\n4.  Calculate the final mean decay distance $L = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau_0$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nE_X_GeV = 8.0     # Production energy in GeV\nm_X_GeV = 1.2     # Mass in GeV\nGamma_X_MeV = 320.0 # Decay width in MeV\n\n# Convert all energy units to MeV for consistency\nE_X = E_X_GeV * 1000  # MeV\nm_X = m_X_GeV * 1000  # MeV\nGamma_X = Gamma_X_MeV   # MeV\n\n# Physical constants\nhbar_c_MeV_fm = 197.3269804 # MeV*fm\nfm_to_m = 1e-15 # conversion factor from femtometers to meters\n\n# --- Calculation using the final derived formula ---\n# L = (sqrt(E^2 - m^2) / m) * (hbar*c / Gamma)\n\n# Calculate the term pc = sqrt(E^2 - m^2)\npc_sq = E_X**2 - m_X**2\npc = math.sqrt(pc_sq)\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor gamma and beta*gamma\ngamma = E_X / m_X\nbeta_gamma = pc / m_X\n\n# Calculate the mean decay distance in femtometers (fm)\nL_fm = beta_gamma * (hbar_c_MeV_fm / Gamma_X)\n\n# Convert the distance to meters\nL_m = L_fm * fm_to_m\n\nprint(f\"{L_m:.15e}\")\n\n```\n```output\n4.064467131855533e-15\n```\n\n### 4. Conclusion and Final Answer\n\nThe Python script calculates the mean decay distance to be approximately $4.064467 \\times 10^{-15}$ meters.\n\nLet's compare this result to the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nOur calculated value ($4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m) is extremely close to option D ($4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m). The very small difference (about 0.025%) is likely due to the use of slightly different rounded values for the physical constants when the problem options were created. Based on the calculation, D is clearly the intended correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The calculation has been performed, and the output is approximately $4.064 \\times 10^{-15}$ meters. Let's analyze this result against the provided options.\n\n### Calculation Breakdown:\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Total Energy of the meson, $E_X = 8$ GeV.\n    *   Rest mass of the meson, $m_X = 1.2$ GeV.\n    *   Decay width of the meson, $\\Gamma_X = 320$ MeV.\n\n2.  **Determine Physical Principles:**\n    *   The **mean lifetime ($\\tau$)** of a particle in its own rest frame is inversely related to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: $\\tau = \\hbar/\\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   Because the particle is moving at a relativistic speed, its lifetime in the laboratory frame is longer due to **time dilation**. The lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau_{lab}$) is given by $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma\\tau$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The **mean decay distance ($L$)** is the distance the particle travels in the lab frame during its lab-frame lifetime: $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n\n3.  **Formulate and Compute:**\n    *   We can combine the formulas: $L = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau = (\\beta c) \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot (\\hbar/\\Gamma)$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   A more direct approach is to express the product $\\beta\\gamma$ in terms of energy and mass. From relativistic kinematics, the momentum ($p$) is related by $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$ and also by $pc = (\\beta\\gamma)mc^2$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$.\n    *   Let's plug in the values (using energy units consistently):\n        $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{(8 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\text{ GeV})^2}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{64 - 1.44}}{1.2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56}}{1.2} \\approx 6.5912$\n    *   Now, calculate the mean decay distance $L = \\beta\\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   Using the standard value $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m):\n        $L \\approx 6.5912 \\times \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n        $L \\approx 6.5912 \\times 0.6166 \\text{ fm} \\approx 4.0644 \\text{ fm}$\n    *   Converting femtometers to meters:\n        $L \\approx 4.0644 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Comparison with Options:\n\n*   Calculated Value: $\\approx 4.064 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n*   Option A: $5.0223 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n*   Option B: $4.0655 \\times 10^{-16}$ m\n*   Option C: $5.0223 \\times 10^{-16}$ m\n*   Option D: $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n\nThe calculated value is virtually identical to option D. The minor difference in the fourth significant figure is negligible and is attributed to the specific precision of physical constants used when formulating the problem's options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
