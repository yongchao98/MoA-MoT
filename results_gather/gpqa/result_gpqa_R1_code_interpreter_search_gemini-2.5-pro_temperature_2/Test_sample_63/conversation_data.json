    "Here is my reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Experimental Data**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B, and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products. I'll analyze the path of the gases step-by-step to identify their composition and quantity.\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   Mixture of Salt A and Salt B.\n    *   Total mass = 7.20 g.\n    *   `moles of A = moles of B` (equimolar).\n    *   Heating to 200°C produces only gases, meaning no solid residue is left.\n\n*   **Gas Analysis Train:**\n    1.  **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n        *   This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n        *   Mass increase = mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = `mass / molar mass` = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol H₂O.\n\n    2.  **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n        *   This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ (by forming a CaCO₃ precipitate).\n        *   The mass of the tube did not change.\n        *   This is a crucial clue: **No acidic gases (CO₂, SO₂, etc.) were produced** in the decomposition.\n\n    3.  **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n        *   Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, meaning the gas supplied oxygen atoms to the copper.\n        *   Mass increase = mass of Oxygen (O) that reacted = 0.80 g.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = `mass / atomic mass` = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol O.\n        *   What gas could provide this oxygen? It must not have been absorbed by the previous tubes. Candidates include O₂, NO, N₂O.\n            *   If O₂: `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. To get 0.05 mol O, we would need 0.025 mol O₂.\n            *   If N₂O: `Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂`. To get 0.05 mol O, we would need **0.05 mol N₂O**. This reaction also produces **0.05 mol of N₂**.\n        *   Let's keep the N₂O hypothesis in mind as it's a common decomposition product of ammonium salts.\n\n    4.  **Remaining Gas C:**\n        *   The gas that survives all three tubes.\n        *   Volume = 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = `Volume / Molar Volume` = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   Gas C must be inert to water, limewater, and hot copper. The most plausible product from the decomposition of salts containing nitrogen (implied by the later reaction with Cu) is **Nitrogen gas (N₂) **.\n\n### **2. Reconstruct the Gas Mixture**\n\nLet's consolidate what we've found about the gas mixture produced by heating the salts.\n\n*   The total N₂ collected at the end (Gas C) is 0.10 mol.\n*   If we assume the gas that reacted with copper was N₂O, this reaction produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   Therefore, the original gas mixture must have contained:\n    *   Initial N₂ = Total N₂ - N₂ produced from N₂O = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol N₂**.\n    *   The amount of N₂O that reacted was **0.05 mol N₂O**.\n    *   The amount of H₂O absorbed was **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n\nSo, the decomposition of the 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B produced:\n`0.20 mol H₂O + 0.05 mol N₂O + 0.05 mol N₂`\n\n### **3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe gaseous products contain Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and Oxygen. This strongly suggests the original salts were ammonium salts with oxygen-containing anions. Let's look for common thermal decomposition reactions that produce our gas mixture.\n\n*   Ammonium nitrite decomposition: `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n*   Ammonium nitrate decomposition (at ~200°C): `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n\nThis looks very promising. Let's test the hypothesis that **Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃**.\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let `n` be the number of moles of each salt.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nThe total products would be:\n*   Moles of N₂ = `n`\n*   Moles of N₂O = `n`\n*   Moles of H₂O = `2n + 2n = 4n`\n\nNow, we match this with the amounts we calculated from the experiment:\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol  → `n = 0.05`\n*   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol → `n = 0.05`\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol → `4n = 0.20` → `n = 0.05`\n\nThe value `n = 0.05` is consistent across all three products. Our hypothesis is correct. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n### **4. Verify the Initial Mass**\n\nLet's perform a final check by calculating the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n\n*   Mass of A (NH₄NO₂) = `moles × molar mass` = 0.05 mol × 64 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n*   Mass of B (NH₄NO₃) = `moles × molar mass` = 0.05 mol × 80 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g**.\nThis perfectly matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the **total number of all atoms in salts A and B**. This refers to the number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n```python\n# The following code verifies the calculations made in the reasoning process.\n\n# ---- Molar masses (approximate values are sufficient) ----\nH_mass = 1\nN_mass = 14\nO_mass = 16\n\n# ---- Moles of products calculated from experimental data ----\nmass_H2O = 3.60  # g\nM_H2O = 2 * H_mass + O_mass # 18 g/mol\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O  # 0.2 mol\n\nmass_O_increase = 0.80 # g\nM_O = O_mass # 16 g/mol\nmoles_O_atoms = mass_O_increase / M_O # 0.05 mol\n\nvolume_C = 2.24 # L\nmolar_volume_STP = 22.4 # L/mol\nmoles_C = volume_C / molar_volume_STP # 0.1 mol\n\n# ---- Reconstruct the gas mixture composition based on hypotheses ----\n# Hypothesis: Gas reacting with Cu is N2O (producing N2), and gas C is N2.\nmoles_N2O = moles_O_atoms # 0.05 mol\nmoles_N2_produced = moles_O_atoms # 0.05 mol\nmoles_N2_initial = moles_C - moles_N2_produced # 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol\n\n# The decomposition yielded: 0.2 mol H2O, 0.05 mol N2O, 0.05 mol N2.\n\n# ---- Test the hypothesis of NH4NO2 and NH4NO3 salts ----\n# From our derived gas quantities, we found that we must have had\n# n = 0.05 mol of each salt.\n\n# ---- Verify total mass ----\nM_NH4NO2 = 2 * N_mass + 4 * H_mass + 2 * O_mass # 64 g/mol\nM_NH4NO3 = 2 * N_mass + 4 * H_mass + 3 * O_mass # 80 g/mol\n\nn = 0.05 # moles\ntotal_mass = n * M_NH4NO2 + n * M_NH4NO3\n# total_mass = 0.05 * 64 + 0.05 * 80 = 3.2 + 4.0 = 7.2 g. This is correct.\n\n# ---- Calculate the final answer ----\natoms_in_A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 # Atoms in NH4NO2\natoms_in_B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3 # Atoms in NH4NO3\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\n\nprint(f\"Total number of all atoms in salts A and B is: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",

Analyze the Gas Mixture**\nFirst, let's identify the gases produced during the decomposition by analyzing their journey through the tubes.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a desiccant that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = `mass / molar mass` = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which means **no acidic gases** were produced.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, which means the gas supplied oxygen to the copper. The mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = `mass / atomic mass` = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol O**.\n    *   The most common nitrogen-based gas that provides oxygen to hot copper and is not absorbed by the previous tubes is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂. According to this stoichiometry, 0.05 moles of N₂O would provide 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms. This reaction also produces 0.05 moles of N₂ gas.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The final volume of gas is 2.24 L at STP. This gas is inert to all previous traps. Nitrogen (N₂) fits this description.\n    *   Moles of final gas = `Volume / Molar Volume` = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **2. Reconstruct the Initial Gas Mixture**\nThe final gas, C, is N₂, and its total amount is 0.10 mol. We know that 0.05 mol of N₂ was produced in tube №3 from the decomposition of N₂O.\n*   Total N₂ at the end = 0.10 mol.\n*   N₂ produced from N₂O = 0.05 mol.\n*   Therefore, N₂ in the original gas mixture = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol N₂**.\n\nSo, the decomposition of the salts produced a mixture of:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n\n### **3. Identify Salts A and B**\nThe products (H₂O, N₂O, N₂) are characteristic of the thermal decomposition of certain ammonium salts. Let's consider these reactions:\n*   `NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite) → N₂ + 2H₂O`\n*   `NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate) → N₂O + 2H₂O` (at ~200-250°C)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let's assume there were `n` moles of Salt A and `n` moles of Salt B. If we identify Salt A as `NH₄NO₂` and Salt B as `NH₄NO₃`, the decomposition would yield:\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃: `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   Total products: `n` moles of N₂, `n` moles of N₂O, and `(2n + 2n) = 4n` moles of H₂O.\n\nNow we match these with the amounts we calculated from the experiment:\n*   Moles of N₂ = `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂O = `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = `4n` = 4 × 0.05 = 0.20 mol\n\nThese values perfectly match our findings. Thus, the mixture consisted of **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂** and **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃**.\n\n### **4. Final Verification and Calculation**\nLet's verify the initial mass.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol × 80.04 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g**. This matches the problem statement.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their formula units).\n*   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n*   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n*   The total number of all atoms is the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt: 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n<<<C>>>"
