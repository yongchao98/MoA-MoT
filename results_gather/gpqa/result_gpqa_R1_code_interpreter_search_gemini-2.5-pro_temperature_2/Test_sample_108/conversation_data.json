    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. We can extract its quantum numbers from the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S_initial = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` corresponds to the total orbital angular momentum `L_initial = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` is the total angular momentum `J_initial = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_initial = (-1)^L_initial`. With `L_initial = 0`, the parity is `P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\nSo, for the initial state: `J^P = 0^+`.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Conservation Laws\n\nThe decay is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`. We must apply the laws of conservation of total angular momentum and parity.\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state is `J_initial = 0`. The final state consists of the final NN system (with total angular momentum `J_final`) and the particle X (with orbital angular momentum `L(X)` relative to the NN system). The total angular momentum of the final state is the vector sum `J_final + L(X)`.\n    Conservation requires: `J_initial = J_final + L(X)` (vector sum).\n    Since `J_initial = 0`, the vectors `J_final` and `L(X)` must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. This gives us the condition:\n    **`J_final = L(X)`**\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity (P):**\n    The parity of the initial state is `P_initial = +1`.\n    The parity of the final state is the product of the parities of its components: `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P_orbital`.\n    *   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_final`\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given in the problem).\n    *   `P_orbital = (-1)^L(X)` (parity of the wavefunction describing the relative motion).\n    So, `P_final = (-1)^L_final * (-1) * (-1)^L(X) = (-1)^(L_final + L(X) + 1)`.\n    Conservation requires `P_initial = P_final`, so `+1 = (-1)^(L_final + L(X) + 1)`.\n    This means the exponent must be an even number: `L_final + L(X) + 1` is even. This simplifies to the condition:\n    **`L_final + L(X)` is odd.**\n\n### 3. Apply the Pauli Statistics Rule\n\nThe problem provides a rule based on the Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon state:\n`T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nWe are given that the isospin of the final NN state is `T(NN)_final = 0`. Substituting this into the rule:\n`0 = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\nFor this equation to hold, `S_final + L_final + 1` must be an even number. This simplifies to the condition:\n**`S_final + L_final` is odd.**\n\n### 4. Check Each Option\n\nWe now test each of the given options against our three derived conditions:\n1.  `J_final = L(X)`\n2.  `L_final + L(X)` is odd\n3.  `S_final + L_final` is odd\n\nThe quantum numbers for the final NN states `(2S+1)L(J)` and particle X orbital angular momentum states (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3) are:\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 2`, `J_final = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `L(X) = 3`.\n*   **Condition 1 (J):** `J_final = 3`, `L(X) = 3`. `3 = 3`. (OK)\n*   **Condition 2 (Parity):** `L_final + L(X) = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Condition 3 (Pauli):** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Result:** Permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_final = 3`, `L_final = 2`, `J_final = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L(X) = 1`.\n*   **Condition 1 (J):** `J_final = 1`, `L(X) = 1`. `1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   **Condition 2 (Parity):** `L_final + L(X) = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Condition 3 (Pauli):** `S_final + L_final = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Result:** Permitted.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 1`, `J_final = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `L(X) = 0`.\n*   **Condition 1 (J):** `J_final = 0`, `L(X) = 0`. `0 = 0`. (OK)\n*   **Condition 2 (Parity):** `L_final + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Condition 3 (Pauli):** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **(VIOLATION)**\n*   **Result:** Not permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 0`, `J_final = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L(X) = 1`.\n*   **Condition 1 (J):** `J_final = 1`, `L(X) = 1`. `1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   **Condition 2 (Parity):** `L_final + L(X) = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Condition 3 (Pauli):** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Result:** Permitted.\n\nThe reaction `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` violates the Pauli statistics rule for the final two-nucleon state and is therefore not permitted.\n\n<<<C>>>"
