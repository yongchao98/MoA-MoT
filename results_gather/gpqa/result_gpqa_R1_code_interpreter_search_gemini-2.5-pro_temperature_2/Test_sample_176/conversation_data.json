    "Here's my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, denoted as $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:**\n    *   The problem states to assume the stars radiate as **black bodies**. The luminosity (total power radiated) of a spherical black body is given by the **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**:\n        $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n        where A is the surface area, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature.\n    *   For a spherical star of radius R, the surface area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$. So, the formula becomes:\n        $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    *   The problem mentions the \"wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest.\" This refers to the peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max}$) of the black body radiation spectrum. The relationship between this peak wavelength and temperature is given by **Wien's Displacement Law**:\n        $\\lambda_{max} \\cdot T = b$\n        where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant.\n    *   The problem also provides radial velocities. The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is affected by the **Doppler effect**. The formula for the relativistic Doppler shift for light is:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} \\sqrt{(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)}$\n        However, for non-relativistic speeds (where v << c), the classical approximation is usually sufficient:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} \\approx \\lambda_{emit} (1 + v_r / c)$\n        where $\\lambda_{obs}$ is the observed wavelength, $\\lambda_{emit}$ is the emitted wavelength, $v_r$ is the radial velocity (positive for receding, negative for approaching), and 'c' is the speed of light. Let's check the speed: 700 km/s is much less than c (300,000 km/s), so the approximation is valid.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:\n    $L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n    $L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\n    The ratio is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Ratios:**\n\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n        $R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2 \\implies \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$\n\n    *   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the trickiest part. It depends on the peak wavelengths.\n        *   From Wien's Law, the temperature is inversely proportional to the *emitted* peak wavelength: $T = b / \\lambda_{max, emit}$.\n        *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{b / \\lambda_{max, emit, 1}}{b / \\lambda_{max, emit, 2}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{max, emit, 2}}{\\lambda_{max, emit, 1}}$\n        *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\n        *   Now, I must relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths using the Doppler shift.\n        *   For Star_1: $v_{r,1} = 0$. So, $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 1} (1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{max, emit, 1}$.\n        *   For Star_2: $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s. The star is moving away (positive velocity is conventionally taken as recession), so its light is redshifted.\n            $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} (1 + v_{r,2} / c)$.\n        *   Since $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$, we can set the expressions equal:\n            $\\lambda_{max, emit, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} (1 + v_{r,2} / c)$\n        *   Rearranging this gives the ratio of emitted wavelengths:\n            $\\frac{\\lambda_{max, emit, 2}}{\\lambda_{max, emit, 1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2} / c}$\n        *   This is exactly the temperature ratio we need: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2} / c}$.\n\n5.  **Combine Everything and Calculate:**\n    Now substitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2} / c} \\right)^4$\n\n    Let's plug in the numbers.\n    *   $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$\n    *   $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s = $7 \\times 10^5$ m/s\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s (using a more precise value for the calculation)\n\n    The calculation is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{7 \\times 10^5}{3 \\times 10^8}} \\right)^4$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + 0.002333...} \\right)^4$\n\n    This calculation is sensitive to the values used, so using a computer is best. I'll use Python for this. Note that the mass information ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is extra information not needed for this specific calculation method, which is based on the black body laws.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Given values from the problem ---\n# Radius ratio\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\n# Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nvr2 = 700 * 1000\n# Speed of light in m/s (using a standard precise value)\nc = 299792458\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the temperature ratio (T1/T2) ---\n# The observed peak wavelengths are the same: lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2\n# For Star 1 (vr1=0): lambda_emit1 = lambda_obs1\n# For Star 2 (vr2=700km/s): lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + vr2/c)\n# So, lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + vr2/c)\n# Rearranging gives: lambda_emit2 / lambda_emit1 = 1 / (1 + vr2/c)\n# From Wien's Law (T is proportional to 1/lambda_emit), we have:\n# T1/T2 = lambda_emit2 / lambda_emit1\nT1_over_T2 = 1 / (1 + vr2 / c)\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the luminosity ratio (L1/L2) ---\n# From the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, L is proportional to R^2 * T^4\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nL1_over_L2 = (R1_over_R2)**2 * (T1_over_T2)**4\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(L1_over_L2)\n```\n\n2.229156024926514\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.229.\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.23\n\nThe value 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall Key Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (total energy radiated per second) of a star behaving as a black body is given by $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$, where $A$ is the surface area, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the surface temperature. For a spherical star of radius $R$, the surface area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$. Therefore, $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature $T$ of a black body is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max}$) of its emitted radiation: $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{max, emit}$.\n    *   **Doppler Effect for Light:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) from a source is different from its emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$) if there is relative radial motion. For speeds much less than the speed of light ($c$), the non-relativistic formula is accurate: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit}(1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity (positive for motion away from the observer).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of luminosities is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n4.  **Determine the Component Ratios from the Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2$, so $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio:**\n        *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is related to the ratio of *emitted* peak wavelengths: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{max, emit, 2}}{\\lambda_{max, emit, 1}}$.\n        *   We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\n        *   Now, we must use the Doppler effect to relate the observed and emitted wavelengths.\n            *   For Star_1: $v_{r,1} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 1}$.\n            *   For Star_2: $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s, so its light is redshifted. $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n        *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal:\n            $\\lambda_{max, emit, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n        *   Rearranging this gives the ratio we need for temperature:\n            $\\frac{\\lambda_{max, emit, 2}}{\\lambda_{max, emit, 1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$.\n        *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Result:**\n    Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c})^4$\n\n    The Python code executed this calculation with the given values:\n    *   $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$\n    *   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c \\approx 299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n    The result of the calculation is approximately **2.229**. Rounding this to two decimal places gives 2.23.\n\n(Note: The information about the mass of the stars is irrelevant to solving this problem, which is based on the properties of black-body radiation.)\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.23\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
