    "To solve this problem, I will systematically analyze the provided DNA sequence and evaluate the given options.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and the Problem:**\n*   The researcher wants to express a recombinant GADD45G protein with an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag.\n*   The expression vector was created and transfected into CHO cells for a preliminary test.\n*   The problem is a failure to detect the overexpressed protein.\n*   The cause is suspected to be within the provided DNA sequence, which represents the coding strand of the construct.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided DNA Sequence:**\nThe sequence starts with `ATG`, which is the universal start codon for translation, coding for Methionine. This is correct.\nThe construct is designed to have the HA tag at the N-terminus, right after the start codon. A common amino acid sequence for the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. Let's see if the DNA sequence correctly encodes this.\n\n*   DNA: `ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC ...`\n*   Translate this:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (M, the start codon)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\nThe translated peptide so far is M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A. The sequence YPYDVPDYA is the HA tag. So, the tag is encoded correctly.\n\n**3. Examine What Follows the Tag Sequence:**\nThe sequence continues immediately after `GCC` (Alanine): `... GCC AAA TGA ...`\nLet's analyze the codons in order:\n*   Codon 1-10: `ATG`...`GCC` (encodes M-HA tag)\n*   Codon 11: `AAA`. This codes for the amino acid Lysine (K).\n*   Codon 12: `TGA`. `TGA` is one of the three standard stop codons (along with `TAA` and `TAG`).\n\nWhen the ribosome encounters this `TGA` codon, it will recruit a release factor, and translation will be terminated. This will result in the production of a very short peptide (M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K) instead of the full-length GADD45G fusion protein. This explains why the full-length protein was not observed.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options:**\n*   **A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** The stop codon in the sequence is `TGA` (transcribed to UGA in mRNA), not `TAA` (UAA). Furthermore, the experiment is in Chinese hamster ovary cells, not mouse cells. Most importantly, stop codons are *supposed* to lack a corresponding tRNA; this is fundamental to how termination works and is not an error. This option is incorrect.\n*   **B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While a missing linker can sometimes cause misfolding and degradation, the presence of a premature stop codon is a far more direct and definitive cause for the lack of full-length protein synthesis. The protein isn't being made in the first place, so subsequent proteolysis isn't the primary issue.\n*   **C) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** As demonstrated above, there is a premature stop codon (`TGA`) right after the tag sequence. This would cause the ribosome to fall off the mRNA and stop translation, perfectly explaining the experimental failure. This option is correct.\n*   **D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** As shown in the translation analysis, the DNA sequence correctly encodes the standard HA tag `YPYDVPDYA`. There is no missense mutation. This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the presence of an early stop codon (`TGA`) in the reading frame is the unambiguous reason for the failed protein expression.\n\n<<<C>>>"
