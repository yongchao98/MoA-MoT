    "Here is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the initial assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere in space. The units of `ρ` would be stars per unit volume (e.g., stars/parsec³).\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars to distance:** Let's consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the Sun. The volume of this sphere is given by the formula `V = (4/3)πd³`. Since the density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` within this distance `d` is the density multiplied by the volume:\n    `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n\n3.  **Introduce parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`). The relationship is `d = 1/plx`. We can substitute this into our equation for `N` to express the number of stars as a function of parallax.\n    `N(plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4/3)πρ * (1/plx³) = (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³`\n    This equation `N(plx)` represents the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx` (since they are within the distance `d = 1/plx`).\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars in a small range of distance:** Let's find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell `dV` is approximately the surface area of the sphere (`4πd²`) times the thickness of the shell (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   The number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`.\n\n5.  **Convert the expression to parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of *parallax*, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We need to convert our expression for `dN` from being in terms of `d` and `dd` to being in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We know `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n6.  **Substitute back into the equation for dN:** Now substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)` into the equation `dN = 4πρd² dd`.\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * [-(1/plx²) d(plx)]`\n    `dN = -4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the final relationship:** The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can rearrange to find it:\n    `dN/d(plx) = -4πρ * (1/plx⁴)`\n\n    The negative sign indicates that as parallax increases (distance decreases), the differential count increases for a fixed interval size `d(plx)`. The magnitude of the number of stars per unit parallax range is what's important for the proportionality.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 1/plx³\nB) ~ 1/plx²\nC) ~ 1/plx⁴\nD) ~ 1/plx¹\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
