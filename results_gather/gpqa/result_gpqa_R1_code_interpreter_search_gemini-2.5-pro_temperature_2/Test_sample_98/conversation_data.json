    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but doesn't distinguish between the choices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   \"None of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\" indicates that there are no protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all of them.\n    *   The crucial information lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicities) of two specific signals:\n        *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This means the corresponding proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet, d), a group of two equivalent protons (giving the triplet, t), and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet, q). The neighbors are: 1H, 2H, and 3H.\n        *   A different signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This means the corresponding proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet, d), a group of two equivalent protons (giving the first triplet, t), and another different group of two equivalent protons (giving the second triplet, t). The neighbors are: 1H, 2H, and 2H.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of Each Candidate:**\n    We need to examine the structure of each option to see which one has protons with the required sets of neighbors to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. Let's systematically draw each structure and analyze the protons on the carbon backbone.\n\n    **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    ```\n             CH₃(c')   CH₃(b')\n              |         |\n      CH₃(e)-CH₂(d)-CH(c)----CH(b)-COOH(a)\n    ```\n    *   H at C3 (Hc): Neighbors are H at C2 (Hb, 1H), H's at C4 (Hd, 2H), H's on methyl group C' (Hc', 3H). **This is a `dtq`**.\n    *   Is there a `dtt`? A proton with 1H, 2H, and 2H neighbors. No proton in this structure has this combination of neighbors. So, A is incorrect.\n\n    **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    ```\n              C₂H₅(c')   C₂H₅(b')\n               |          |\n      CH₃(e)-CH₂(d)--CH(c)-----CH(b)-COOH(a)\n    ```\n    *   H at C3 (Hc): Neighbors are H at C2 (Hb, 1H), H's at C4 (Hd, 2H), and H's on the CH₂ of its ethyl group (Hc', 2H). **This is a `dtt`**.\n    *   Is there a `dtq`? A proton with 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors. No proton in this structure has this combination. The protons on the CH₂ groups of the ethyl side chains are coupled to one backbone proton and three methyl protons, giving `dq`-like signals (doublet of quartets), not a `dtq`. So, B is incorrect.\n\n    **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    ```\n       (CH₃)₂CH(d)----CH(c)(CH₃)----CH₂(b)----COOH(a)\n    ```\n    Let's draw it fully:\n    ```\n          CH₃       CH₃(c')\n           |         |\n      CH₃--CH(d)----CH(c)----CH₂(b)----COOH(a)\n    ```\n    *   H at C3 (Hc): Neighbors are H at C4 (Hd, 1H), H's at C2 (Hb, 2H), H's on methyl group C' (Hc', 3H). **This is a `dtq`**.\n    *   Is there a `dtt`? A proton with 1H, 2H, and 2H neighbors. No proton in this structure fits this description. So, C is incorrect.\n\n    **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    This formula describes a pentanoic acid chain with ethyl groups at positions 3 and 4.\n    ```\n                 C₂H₅ (on C4, protons g,h)    C₂H₅ (on C3, protons d,i)\n                  |                            |\n      CH₃(f)-----CH(e)------------------------CH(c)-----CH₂(b)-----COOH(a)\n    ```\n    Let's expand the ethyl groups to see the protons: `C₂H₅` is `-CH₂-CH₃`\n    ```\n                 CH₂(g)-CH₃(h)\n                 |\n      CH₃(f)-----CH(e)----CH(c)----CH₂(b)-----COOH(a)\n                            |\n                            CH₂(d)-CH₃(i)\n    ```\n    Now, let's analyze the key protons:\n    *   **Proton at C3 (Hc):** This proton has three different neighboring groups of protons:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (He): 1H → splits the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n        2.  The two protons at C2 (Hb): 2H → splits the signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n        3.  The two protons on its ethyl group side chain (Hd): 2H → splits the signal into another **triplet (t)**.\n        Therefore, the signal for Hc is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second piece of NMR data.\n    *   **Proton at C4 (He):** This proton also has three different neighboring groups of protons:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (Hc): 1H → splits the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n        2.  The two protons on its ethyl group side chain (Hg): 2H → splits the signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n        3.  The three protons on the terminal methyl group at C5 (Hf): 3H → splits the signal into a **quartet (q)**.\n        Therefore, the signal for He is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first piece of NMR data.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Molecule D is the only candidate that has a proton structure consistent with a `dtt` signal (at C3) and another proton consistent with a `dtq` signal (at C4). Therefore, the unknown compound is `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
