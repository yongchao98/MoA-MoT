    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms among different energy states is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (let's call its energy E_j and population N_j) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (energy E_i, population N_i) is given by:\n\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\n    Where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to both stars:** We can write the population ratio for each star using its respective temperature (T_1 and T_2). Let's denote the ratio `N_j / N_i` as `R`.\n\n    *   For star_1 (temperature T_1):\n        R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\n    *   For star_2 (temperature T_2):\n        R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    Note that the statistical weights (`g_j`, `g_i`) and the energy difference (`ΔE`) are the same for both stars because we are considering the same transition in the same type of atom (iron).\n\n4.  **Use the information from the problem:** The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the population ratio in star_1 is twice the population ratio in star_2.\n\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n5.  **Set up and simplify the equation:** Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship `R_1 = 2 * R_2`.\n\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n    The term for the statistical weights, `(g_j / g_i)`, is on both sides, so it cancels out:\n\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n6.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To isolate the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides.\n\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(exp(x)) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n    Now, rearrange the equation to solve for `ln(2)`:\n\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T_2) - (1 / T_1) ] = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the brackets:\n\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Calculate the value of ΔE / k:** The problem gives the energy difference `ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is a fundamental physical constant with the value `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio is:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K\n\n8.  **Finalize the equation:** Substitute this value back into the equation from step 6.\n\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
