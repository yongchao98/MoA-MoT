    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance, which we can call N(r), and the distance, r.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:** We are given the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax, N(plx), and the parallax, plx.\n    *   N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5\n\n3.  **Recall the Fundamental Relationship:** Parallax (plx) and distance (r) are inversely related.\n    *   plx = 1/r\n\n4.  **Connect the Distributions:** We need to find a way to convert the distribution with respect to parallax, N(plx), to a distribution with respect to distance, N(r).\n\n    The number of stars (dN) in a small interval is the number density multiplied by the size of the interval. The number of stars is a physical quantity and must be the same whether we count them in a parallax interval or the corresponding distance interval. Therefore, the number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` must be equal in magnitude to the number of stars in the corresponding distance interval `d(r)`.\n\n    *   |dN| = N(plx) * |d(plx)|\n    *   |dN| = N(r) * |d(r)|\n\n    From this, we can write:\n    *   N(r) * |d(r)| = N(plx) * |d(plx)|\n    *   N(r) = N(plx) * |d(plx) / d(r)|\n\n5.  **Calculate the Conversion Factor |d(plx) / d(r)|:** We need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance.\n    *   plx = 1/r = r⁻¹\n    *   d(plx) / d(r) = d(r⁻¹) / d(r) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n\n    Since we are dealing with number densities (which are positive), we take the absolute value of the derivative:\n    *   |d(plx) / d(r)| = |-1/r²| = 1/r²\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Relationship for N(r):** Now substitute this conversion factor back into the equation from step 4.\n    *   N(r) = N(plx) * (1/r²)\n\n7.  **Express N(plx) in terms of r:** We are given N(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵. Let's substitute plx = 1/r into this proportionality.\n    *   N(plx) ∝ 1 / (1/r)⁵\n    *   N(plx) ∝ 1 / (1/r⁵)\n    *   N(plx) ∝ r⁵\n\n8.  **Combine the Proportionalities:** Now, substitute the expression for N(plx) from step 7 into the equation for N(r) from step 6.\n    *   N(r) ∝ N(plx) * (1/r²)\n    *   N(r) ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)\n    *   N(r) ∝ r⁵⁻²\n    *   N(r) ∝ r³\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance, N(r), is proportional to r³. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
