    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Epoxide Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The name `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` corresponds to the structure of cyclohexene oxide. The bicyclo numbering designates the two carbons of the epoxide bond as C1 and C6. The oxygen is atom 7.\n    *   The molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across the C1-C6 bond.\n    *   There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The absolute stereochemistry is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). We will work with these labels as given.\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. This reagent acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity of the Attack**\n\nThe problem statement provides the rule for regioselectivity: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by O, C1, and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a tertiary carbon center.\n*   Carbon C6 has no substituent other than hydrogen, making it a secondary carbon center.\n*   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon.\n*   The nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi will attack at C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Attack**\n\nThe problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction mechanism.\n\n*   The attack occurs at C6. The configuration at C6 will be inverted.\n*   The original configuration at C6 is given as (6S). After inversion, the configuration at this carbon will become (R).\n*   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not involved in the reaction. They will remain unchanged.\n    *   C1 remains (R).\n    *   C3 remains (R).\n    *   C4 remains (R).\n\n**4. Determine the Structure and Naming of the Product**\n\n*   The attack of the methyl group at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The C1-O bond remains intact.\n*   After an aqueous workup (which is standard and implied in such problems), the oxygen atom is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The resulting product is a cyclohexane ring with the following substituents:\n    *   An -OH group at the position of the original C1.\n    *   A methyl group at the position of the original C1.\n    *   A methyl group at the position of the original C3.\n    *   A methyl group at the position of the original C4.\n    *   A new methyl group (from the reagent) at the position of the original C6.\n\n*   To name the product correctly according to IUPAC rules, we must re-number the cyclohexane ring:\n    1.  The carbon bearing the hydroxyl group gets the highest priority and is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant.\n    2.  We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locant numbers.\n    *   The methyl groups are located at the positions of the original C1, C3, C4, and C6.\n    *   Let's see the two possible numbering directions starting from the new C1 (old C1):\n        *   Clockwise (old C1 -> C2 -> C3...): Methyls at new C1, new C3(old C3), new C4(old C4), new C6(old C6). This gives the locant set {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n        *   Counter-clockwise (old C1 -> C6 -> C5...): Methyls are at new C1(old C1), new C2(old C6), new C4(old C4), new C5(old C3). This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Comparing the sets {1,3,4,6} and {1,2,4,5}, the latter is lower (based on the first point of difference: 2 is lower than 3).\n    *   Therefore, the product is named as a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n*   This constitutional name eliminates options C and D, which are 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol derivatives (these would result from attack at C1).\n\n**5. Assign the Stereochemistry to the Product**\n\nWe now map the stereochemical descriptors from the old numbering to the new IUPAC numbering.\n\n*   **New C1 (Old C1):** Configuration is retained. It was (1R) and remains (R). -> **(1R)**\n*   **New C2 (Old C6):** Configuration is inverted. It was (6S) and becomes (R). -> **(2R)**\n*   **New C4 (Old C4):** Configuration is retained. It was (4R) and remains (R). -> **(4R)**\n*   **New C5 (Old C3):** Configuration is retained. It was (3R) and remains (R). -> **(5R)**\n\nCombining the name and the stereochemistry, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
