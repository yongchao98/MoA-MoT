    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination, Ar-H + Br₂ → Ar-Br + HBr, catalyzed by FeBr₃). The substituent already present on the benzene ring (C₆H₅-) determines the position (ortho, meta, or para) where the new bromine atom will attach.\n\nSubstituents are classified based on their effect on the reaction rate and directing properties:\n1.  **Activating, Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive. They direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho (o-) and para (p-) positions. These will produce a high yield of o- and p-isomers.\n2.  **Deactivating, Meta-directing groups:** These withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta (m-) position. These will produce a very low yield of the p-isomer.\n3.  **Deactivating, Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** Halogens are an exception. They withdraw electron density (deactivating) but direct the incoming electrophile to the o- and p-positions.\n\n### **Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nLet's classify the substituent for each of the six substances:\n*   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** -CH₃ is an activating, o,p-directing group.\n*   **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC₂H₅ is a deactivating, m-directing group.\n*   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a deactivating, o,p-directing group.\n*   **4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** -NO₂ is a strongly deactivating, m-directing group.\n*   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** -C₂H₅ is an activating, o,p-directing group.\n*   **6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a deactivating, m-directing group.\n\n### **Step 3: Separate into Low and High Para-Yield Groups**\n\nThe substances that are m-directing will produce a very small amount of the para-isomer. The substances that are o,p-directing will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n*   **Low Para-Yield Group (m-directors):** Nitrobenzene (4), Benzoic acid (6), Ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   **High Para-Yield Group (o,p-directors):** Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nTherefore, the final ordered list will have substances {4, 6, 2} appearing before {1, 5, 3}.\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Substances within the Low-Yield Group**\n\nFor the m-directing groups (4, 6, 2), the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is more strongly m-directing, leaving a smaller fraction for the o- and p-positions.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n*   -NO₂ is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It will give the highest proportion of meta-product and thus the lowest proportion of para-product. (Para-isomer yield for bromination is ~0.7%).\n*   -COOH is a strong deactivator, but less so than -NO₂. (Para-isomer yield is ~2%).\n*   -COOC₂H₅ is also a strong deactivator, very similar to -COOH but generally considered slightly weaker. Thus, it will be slightly less meta-selective, yielding a bit more para-product than benzoic acid. (Para-isomer yield is typically around 4-8%).\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\nThe beginning of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 5: Order the Substances within the High-Yield Group**\n\nFor the o,p-directing groups (1, 3, 5), we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho substitution. The para-isomer is generally favored over the ortho-isomer due to steric hindrance, where the substituent blocks access to the adjacent ortho positions.\n\n*   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The -CH₃ group has moderate steric bulk. The approximate para-isomer yield for bromination is **~67%**.\n*   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The -C₂H₅ group is sterically larger than the -CH₃ group. This increased steric hindrance will favor the para position even more. Therefore, the para-yield for ethylbenzene will be higher than for toluene. Let's estimate it to be **~75%**.\n*   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl group directs o,p. Although it's a deactivating group, it has a high preference for para-substitution. This is due to a combination of its steric size and a strong deactivating inductive effect, which is felt more strongly at the ortho positions than the para position, making para-attack more favorable. The para-isomer yield for bromination is very high, at **~88%**.\n\nComparing the para-yield percentages:\nToluene (1) ≈ 67%\nEthylbenzene (5) ≈ 75%\nChlorobenzene (3) ≈ 88%\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nThe end of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 6: Combine the Groups to Get the Final Order**\n\nCombining the ordered low-yield and high-yield groups gives the complete sequence for increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the following substances:\nNitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
