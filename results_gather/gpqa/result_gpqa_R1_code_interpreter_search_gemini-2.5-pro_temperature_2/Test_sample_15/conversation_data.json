    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image and will rotate plane-polarized light. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a stereocenter (like a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal planes of symmetry or centers of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond. A planar molecule always has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), making it superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors: (3aR, 7aS) for chiral centers and (E) for the double bond geometry. Naming a compound with specific R/S configurations indicates a single, specific stereoisomer. For a complex, bridged molecule like this, it is almost certain to be chiral unless it is a special case of a meso compound. A molecule given as a specific enantiomer (e.g., the (3aR, 7aS) form) is, by definition, chiral. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3). The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other chiral center group). When a molecule has two identical chiral centers with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making them achiral despite having chiral centers. Thus, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. Here, both chiral centers have the same configuration (R,R). This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, existing as one of a pair of enantiomers (its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer). Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the -CH=CH-CH2- part of the ring, and (4) the -CH2-CH=CH- part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer. Since this is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    This name specifies the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis). In this highly symmetric molecule, the carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not chiral centers because the two paths around the ring from any of these carbons are identical. The molecule has multiple planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane containing one C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond). Due to this symmetry, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers. No carbon atom in this molecule is bonded to four different groups. For instance, C3 of the chain is bonded to H, two identical methyl groups (-CH3), and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it has two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, there are three optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThus, the total number of optically active compounds is 3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
