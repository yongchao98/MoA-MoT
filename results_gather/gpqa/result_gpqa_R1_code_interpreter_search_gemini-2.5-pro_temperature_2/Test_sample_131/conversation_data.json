    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Information Given in the Question**\n\nFirst, let's break down the data from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the number of signals, their splitting patterns (multiplicity), and their relative integrations for each of the four possible compounds. This depends on the chemical equivalence of the protons, which is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are *para* to each other, so their coupling is negligible (J ≈ 0 Hz). This will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at 1, 2, 4, 5) are all chemically equivalent. This will produce **one alkyl singlet** integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They are *meta* to each other, and meta-coupling is very small (J ≈ 1-3 Hz), so they will appear as **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by reflection across the plane (2 x 3H = 6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique as it lies on the plane of symmetry (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is also unique as it lies on the plane of symmetry (3H).\n        *   This results in **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H. The ratio is 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H, in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. However, they are *ortho* (adjacent) to each other. Ortho coupling is significant (J ≈ 6-10 Hz). They would split each other, producing a complex signal (an AB quartet or a pair of doublets), **not a singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** Me-1/Me-4 are equivalent (6H), and Me-2/Me-3 are equivalent (6H), giving two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is ruled out because the aromatic signal is not a singlet.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, similar to Durene.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are chemically equivalent, giving **one aromatic singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. An ethyl group gives a **quartet** (-CH2-) and a **triplet** (-CH3-), not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is ruled out because the alkyl signals are not all singlets.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify the Correct Pair and Verify the Combined Spectrum**\n\nBased on the analysis in Step 2, two of the four compounds are immediately eliminated:\n*   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is eliminated due to its non-singlet aromatic signal.\n*   1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated due to its non-singlet alkyl signals.\n\nThis leaves only **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)** as possibilities. Let's check if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the experimental data. This corresponds to **Option A**.\n\n**Verifying the mixture of Durene and Isodurene (1:1):**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   Isodurene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   If these two signals have different chemical shifts (which they will), the combined spectrum shows **two singlets**. Since the mixture is 1:1 and both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   Isodurene contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   This would give a total of four signals unless some have the same chemical shift (accidental isochronicity).\n    *   The problem states there are **three signals** with a **2:1:1** ratio. Let's calculate what integrations this corresponds to. The total number of alkyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 (from Durene) + 12 (from Isodurene) = 24H.\n    *   If the ratio is 2k:1k:1k, the total is 4k.\n    *   4k = 24H, which means k = 6H.\n    *   Therefore, the three signals in the spectrum must have integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   How can we get signals of {12H, 6H, 6H} from the individual components which contribute {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}?\n        *   The 12H signal from Durene can be the first observed signal.\n        *   The 6H signal from Isodurene can be the second observed signal.\n        *   The two 3H signals from Isodurene must have the same chemical shift, appearing as a single signal with a combined integration of 3H + 3H = 6H. This becomes the third observed signal.\n    *   Thus, we see three signals with integrations 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that is consistent with all the NMR data provided (singlet multiplicities, number of signals, and integration ratios) is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nThe correct option is **A**.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning process has logically deduced the answer without the need for code execution.\n# This code block is provided to formally represent the computational logic as explored in the reasoning.\n# It confirms the integration ratio calculation for the correct pair of compounds.\n\ndef analyze_mixture(durene_protons, isodurene_protons, overlap_hypothesis):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the resulting NMR signal ratios for a 1:1 mixture based on an overlap hypothesis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Protons from a 1:1 mixture\n    durene_h = durene_protons\n    isodurene_h1, isodurene_h2, isodurene_h3 = isodurene_protons\n\n    all_signals = [durene_h, isodurene_h1, isodurene_h2, isodurene_h3]\n    \n    final_integrals = []\n    if overlap_hypothesis == \"isodurene_3H_overlap\":\n        # Durene signal is distinct\n        final_integrals.append(durene_h)\n        # Isodurene 6H signal is distinct\n        final_integrals.append(isodurene_h1)\n        # Isodurene 3H signals overlap\n        final_integrals.append(isodurene_h2 + isodurene_h3)\n\n    if not final_integrals:\n        return None, None\n        \n    final_integrals.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Calculate the ratio\n    greatest_common_divisor = final_integrals[-1]\n    ratio = [int(h / greatest_common_divisor) for h in final_integrals]\n    \n    return final_integrals, ratio\n\n# Alkyl proton signals for each compound\ndurene_alkyl_signals = 12\nisodurene_alkyl_signals = (6, 3, 3)\n\n# Test the hypothesis for Option A\nintegrals, ratio = analyze_mixture(durene_alkyl_signals, isodurene_alkyl_signals, \"isodurene_3H_overlap\")\n\nprint(f\"Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\")\nprint(f\"Predicted integrals in mixture: {integrals}\")\nprint(f\"Predicted ratio: {ratio}\")\nprint(f\"Experimental ratio: [2, 1, 1]\")\n\nif ratio == [2, 1, 1]:\n    print(\"Conclusion: Option A is consistent with the experimental data.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Conclusion: Option A is not consistent with the experimental data.\")\n\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires us to determine which two compounds from a given list, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produce a specific 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Experimental NMR Data**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two signals observed around 6.7 ppm. Both are singlets. Their integration ratio is 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three signals observed around 2.2 ppm. All are singlets. Their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the structure and symmetry of each compound to predict its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Due to their `para` relationship, there's no significant coupling. They will appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the high symmetry.

However, they are `ortho` (adjacent) to each other, resulting in significant coupling. They would appear as a complex multiplet (e.g., an AB quartet), **not a singlet**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is inconsistent with the data and can be **eliminated**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula Check:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. This is valid.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, resulting in a **single singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The signal for the ethyl group's -CH2- protons would be a quartet, and the -CH3- protons would be a triplet. The spectrum does **not consist of only singlets** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is inconsistent with the data and can be **eliminated**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture**\nWe have eliminated 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. The only remaining possibility is a mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, which corresponds to option A. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene).\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   Isodurene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   In the mixture, we will observe **two distinct singlets** (as the chemical environments are different), each integrating to 2H. The ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   Isodurene contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The problem states that only three signals are observed in a 2:1:1 ratio. This implies an accidental overlap (isochronicity) of signals. The total number of alkyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 + 6 + 3 + 3 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   This is perfectly explained if the two 3H signals from Isodurene are isochronous (have the same chemical shift), leading to the following observed signals:\n        1.  The 12H singlet from Durene.\n        2.  The 6H singlet from Isodurene.\n        3.  A combined 6H singlet from the two 3H signals of Isodurene.\n    *   The resulting integrations are 12H, 6H, and 6H, which gives a ratio of **2:1:1**. This also matches the experimental data.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\nThe 1H NMR data is only consistent with a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n```python\n# This script confirms the calculation of the integration ratio for the alkyl protons\n# in a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n# Protons from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) alkyl groups\ndurene_alkyl_h = 12\n\n# Protons from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene) alkyl groups\nisodurene_alkyl_h = [6, 3, 3]\n\n# The experimental data shows 3 signals, implying signal overlap.\n# Hypothesis: The two 3H signals from Isodurene overlap.\nobserved_signals_integrals = [\n    durene_alkyl_h,            # Signal 1\n    isodurene_alkyl_h[0],      # Signal 2\n    isodurene_alkyl_h[1] + isodurene_alkyl_h[2] # Signal 3 (overlap)\n]\n\n# Sort the integrals to make ratio calculation easier\nobserved_signals_integrals.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Find the smallest integral to determine the ratio\nsmallest_integral = min(observed_signals_integrals)\n\n# Calculate the simplified ratio\nratio = [int(i / smallest_integral) for i in observed_signals_integrals]\n\nprint(f\"Predicted integrals in mixture: {observed_signals_integrals}\")\nprint(f\"Predicted simplified ratio: {ratio}\")\nprint(f\"The predicted ratio of {ratio} matches the experimental ratio of [2, 1, 1].\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution based on the analysis of the 1H NMR spectra for each potential compound and the resulting mixture.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Individual Compounds**\n\nFirst, let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four options to see if they fit the molecular formula and the described signal patterns.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two chemically equivalent protons. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** (for 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** (for 12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two chemically equivalent protons. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** (for 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups are not all equivalent. This leads to **three alkyl singlets**: one for the two equivalent methyl groups at C1 and C3 (6H), one for the unique methyl group at C2 (3H), and one for the unique methyl group at C5 (3H). The integration ratio is 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons are adjacent (`ortho`) to each other. They would split each other to form a multiplet (an AB quartet), **not a singlet**. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons on the ethyl groups would show a characteristic **quartet** (-CH2-) and **triplet** (-CH3-), not singlets. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Mixture**\n\nThe only two valid candidates that produce only singlet signals are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's examine if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides another singlet (2H).\n    *   A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 1:1. This perfectly matches the observation.\n\n*   **Alkyl Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H).\n    *   The problem states that only three total alkyl signals are observed. This indicates that two of the signals must accidentally overlap (have the same chemical shift). The most likely overlap is between the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n    *   If this occurs, the signals in the mixture would be:\n        1.  A singlet integrating to **12H** (from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n        2.  A singlet integrating to **6H** (from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n        3.  A singlet integrating to **6H** (from the overlap of the two 3H signals of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n    *   The integrations are 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the observation.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds in the mixture are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
