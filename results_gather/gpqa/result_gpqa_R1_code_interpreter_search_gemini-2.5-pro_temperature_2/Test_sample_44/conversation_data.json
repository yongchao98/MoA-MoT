    "This problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. System Properties**\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number `n` and the spin projection `m_s` (+1/2 or -1/2). This implies that each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L are given by:\n    `E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)` where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a unit of energy `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n\n**2. Ground State Energy**\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   The lowest energy level is `n=1`. It can hold two particles (spin up, spin down). Their combined energy is `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n*   The next two particles go into the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n*   The total energy of the ground state (`E_gs`) is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n    `E_gs = 2*E_1 + 2*E_2 = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n    The particle configuration is `(n=1)^2 (n=2)^2`.\n\n**3. First Excited State Energy**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2` and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n*   We excite one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n*   The new configuration is two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy of the first excited state (`E_1st`) is:\n    `E_1st = 2*E_1 + 1*E_2 + 1*E_3 = 2*(1^2*E) + 1*(2^2*E) + 1*(3^2*E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n    The particle configuration is `(n=1)^2 (n=2)^1 (n=3)^1`.\n\n**4. Second Excited State Energy**\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider all possible excitations from the ground state that would result in a higher energy than the first excited state and find the minimum among them.\n*   **Possibility A: Excite one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.**\n    *   Configuration: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = `1*E_1 + 2*E_2 + 1*E_3 = 1*(1^2*E) + 2*(2^2*E) + 1*(3^2*E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Possibility B: Excite two particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.**\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, two in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = `2*E_1 + 2*E_3 = 2*(1^2*E) + 2*(3^2*E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n*   **Possibility C: Excite one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.**\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy = `2*E_1 + 1*E_2 + 1*E_4 = 2*(1^2*E) + 1*(2^2*E) + 1*(4^2*E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of these possible excited states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state (`E_2nd`) is 18E.\n\nLet's write a python code to verify our calculation.\n```python\n# A simple script to calculate the energies based on the derived configurations.\n\n# Define the single-particle energy level function in terms of E=1.\ndef E_n(n):\n    return n**2\n\n# --- Ground State ---\n# Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2\nE_gs = 2 * E_n(1) + 2 * E_n(2)\nprint(f\"Ground state energy: {E_gs}E\")\n\n# --- First Excited State ---\n# Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3\nE_1st = 2 * E_n(1) + 1 * E_n(2) + 1 * E_n(3)\nprint(f\"First excited state energy: {E_1st}E\")\n\n# --- Second Excited State ---\n# We compare the possible configurations to find the lowest energy level above the first excited state.\n# Config A: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3\nE_2nd_A = 1 * E_n(1) + 2 * E_n(2) + 1 * E_n(3)\n\n# Config B: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3\nE_2nd_B = 2 * E_n(1) + 2 * E_n(3)\n\n# Config C: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4\nE_2nd_C = 2 * E_n(1) + 1 * E_n(2) + 1 * E_n(4)\n\n# The second excited state energy is the minimum of these possibilities.\nE_2nd = min(E_2nd_A, E_2nd_B, E_2nd_C)\nprint(f\"Second excited state energy: {E_2nd}E\")\n\n```\n**Summary of Results**\n*   Ground State Energy = 10E\n*   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n*   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThe energies of the three states are 10E, 15E, and 18E. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the System and Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being spin-1/2, they are fermions.\n*   **Potential Well:** They are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in this well are given by the formula:\n    `E_n = n^2 * pi^2 * hbar^2 / (2 * m * L^2)` where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit `E = pi^2 * hbar^2 / (2 * m * L^2)`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be written concisely as `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since the particles are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In this case, a state is defined by its energy level `n` and its spin (`up` or `down`). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_gs)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1:** We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n*   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles here. Their combined energy is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 8E`.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum:\n`E_gs = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   The ground state configuration is `(n=1)^2 (n=2)^2`.\n*   The highest occupied level is `n=2`. The lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n*   We promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n\nThe total energy of this state is:\n`E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)`\n`E_1st = (2 * 1^2 * E) + (1 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 3^2 * E)`\n`E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy. We must consider the different ways to create an excited state with more energy than the first excited state and find the one with the least energy.\n\n*   **Possibility A: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: `(n=1)^1 (n=2)^2 (n=3)^1`\n    *   Energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = E + 2*(4E) + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n\n*   **Possibility B: Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: `(n=1)^2 (n=3)^2`\n    *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n\n*   **Possibility C: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: `(n=1)^2 (n=2)^1 (n=4)^1`\n    *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of these possibilities (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is `18E`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<C>>>"
