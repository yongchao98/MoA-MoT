    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the given information about the compound:**\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **FTIR indicates a carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl functional group.\n*   **FTIR indicates an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** One of the substituents is a halogen atom (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I) bonded directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Propose possible chemical structures:**\n*   We have a benzene ring with a halogen substituent (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms, which are 2 carbons and at least one oxygen from the carbonyl group.\n*   The most common and simple C2 group containing a carbonyl is the **acetyl group** (-C(=O)CH3).\n*   Let's combine these pieces: The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula would be C8H7XO.\n\n**3. Consider the positional isomers (ortho, meta, para):**\n*   The problem describes the 1H NMR data. The pattern of signals for the aromatic protons is highly dependent on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n*   **Para-substitution (1,4-disubstitution):** Due to the symmetry of the molecule, there are only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons. This typically results in a simple spectrum with two signals, which appear as two doublets (an AA'BB' system), each integrating to 2H.\n*   **Ortho- and meta-substitution:** These patterns lack symmetry, resulting in four distinct aromatic protons. This leads to a more complex spectrum with four different signals, usually with complex multiplicities (e.g., doublets, triplets, doublet of doublets).\n\n**4. Analyze the provided 1H NMR data options:**\n*   Options **B** and **C** both show two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), each integrating to 2H. This strongly suggests a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n*   Options A and D have chemical shifts and patterns that are inconsistent with a di-substituted aromatic ring. The peaks around 4.6-4.8 ppm are not in the aromatic proton region (typically ~6.5-8.5 ppm).\n\n**5. Evaluate Option C:**\n*   **1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This is a classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring, representing the 4 aromatic protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** 2.3 (3H, s). This signal corresponds to a methyl group (-CH3) with 3 protons. The chemical shift (~2.3 ppm) is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (an acetyl group). The multiplicity is a singlet (s) because there are no protons on the adjacent atom (the carbonyl carbon).\n*   **Conclusion for Option C:** This data perfectly matches the expected spectrum for a **para-haloacetophenone** (structure: X-C6H4-COCH3). All features (number of signals, chemical shifts, integration, and splitting patterns) are consistent.\n\n**6. Evaluate Option B:**\n*   **1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n*   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO).\n*   The peak at 3.7 ppm could be a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   This suggests a **para-halophenylacetaldehyde** structure (X-C6H4-CH2CHO). This structure also has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n*   However, let's check the splitting (multiplicity). In the structure Ar-CH2-CHO:\n    *   The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is adjacent to the CH2 group and should be a **triplet (t)**. The data shows a singlet (s).\n    *   The methylene protons (-CH2-) are adjacent to the CHO proton and should be a **doublet (d)**. The data shows a singlet (s).\n*   **Conclusion for Option B:** The multiplicities in the data are incorrect for the proposed structure. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**7. Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data presented in Option C is the only one that correctly and completely describes the spectrum for such a molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>"
