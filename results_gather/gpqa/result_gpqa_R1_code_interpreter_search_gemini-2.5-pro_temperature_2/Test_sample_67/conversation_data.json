    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state.**\n    The particle is a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$, where $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio and $\\vec{S}$ is the spin angular momentum operator.\n    Initially, the magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field $\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}$. This means the particle is in the quantum state where the z-component of the magnetic moment has its maximum positive value. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator $S_z$ has two eigenstates:\n    *   Spin-up along z, denoted as $|+\\rangle_z$ or $|\\uparrow\\rangle_z$, with eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$.\n    *   Spin-down along z, denoted as $|-\\rangle_z$ or $|\\downarrow\\rangle_z$, with eigenvalue $-\\hbar/2$.\n    The corresponding z-component of the magnetic moment is $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$. To have the magnetic moment aligned with the +Z direction (assuming $\\gamma > 0$), the spin must be in the spin-up state.\n    So, the initial state of the system at time $t=0$ is $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |+\\rangle_z$.\n\n2.  **Identify the new Hamiltonian.**\n    At $t=0$, the magnetic field is suddenly changed to $\\vec{B} = B \\hat{y}$. The Hamiltonian of the system for $t > 0$ describes the interaction of the magnetic moment with this new field:\n    $H = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B} = -(\\gamma \\vec{S}) \\cdot (B \\hat{y}) = -\\gamma B S_y$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the time evolution of the state.**\n    The state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iHt/\\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle$.\n    To calculate this evolution, it is easiest to express the initial state $|\\psi(0)\\rangle$ in the basis of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian $H$. The eigenstates of $H$ are the eigenstates of the spin operator $S_y$. Let's call them $|+\\rangle_y$ and $|-\\rangle_y$, with eigenvalues $+\\hbar/2$ and $-\\hbar/2$ respectively.\n\n    The energy eigenvalues are:\n    $E_{\\uparrow, y} = -\\gamma B (+\\hbar/2) = -\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$ for the state $|+\\rangle_y$.\n    $E_{\\downarrow, y} = -\\gamma B (-\\hbar/2) = +\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$ for the state $|-\\rangle_y$.\n\n    We need to express the initial state $|+\\rangle_z$ in terms of $|+\\rangle_y$ and $|-\\rangle_y$. The relationship between the z-basis and y-basis eigenstates for spin-1/2 is:\n    $|+\\rangle_y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+\\rangle_z + i |-\\rangle_z)$\n    $|-\\rangle_y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+\\rangle_z - i |-\\rangle_z)$\n    By adding these two equations, we can solve for $|+\\rangle_z$:\n    $|+\\rangle_z = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+\\rangle_y + |-\\rangle_y)$.\n\n    Now we can find the time-evolved state $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$:\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iHt/\\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle = e^{-iHt/\\hbar} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+\\rangle_y + |-\\rangle_y) \\right]$\n    Since $|+\\rangle_y$ and $|-\\rangle_y$ are energy eigenstates, the evolution is simple:\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left[ e^{-iE_{\\uparrow, y}t/\\hbar} |+\\rangle_y + e^{-iE_{\\downarrow, y}t/\\hbar} |-\\rangle_y \\right]$\n    Substituting the energy values:\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left[ e^{-i(-\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2})t/\\hbar} |+\\rangle_y + e^{-i(+\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2})t/\\hbar} |-\\rangle_y \\right]$\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left[ e^{i\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t} |+\\rangle_y + e^{-i\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t} |-\\rangle_y \\right]$\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value of the observable.**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle$.\n\n    Let's express $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$ back in the z-basis to make calculating the action of $S_z$ easy.\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left[ e^{i\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+\\rangle_z + i|-\\rangle_z) + e^{-i\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+\\rangle_z - i|-\\rangle_z) \\right]$\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (e^{i\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t} + e^{-i\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t})|+\\rangle_z + i(e^{i\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t} - e^{-i\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t})|-\\rangle_z \\right]$\n    Using Euler's identities ($2\\cos\\theta = e^{i\\theta}+e^{-i\\theta}$ and $2i\\sin\\theta = e^{i\\theta}-e^{-i\\theta}$):\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 2\\cos(\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t)|+\\rangle_z + i(2i\\sin(\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t))|-\\rangle_z \\right]$\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\cos(\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t)|+\\rangle_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t)|-\\rangle_z$\n\n    Now we calculate $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle$:\n    $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle$\n    $= \\left( \\cos(\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t)\\langle+|_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t)\\langle-|_z \\right) S_z \\left( \\cos(\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t)|+\\rangle_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t)|-\\rangle_z \\right)$\n    Since $S_z|+\\rangle_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}|+\\rangle_z$ and $S_z|-\\rangle_z = -\\frac{\\hbar}{2}|-\\rangle_z$:\n    $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\left( \\dots \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\cos(\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t)|+\\rangle_z + \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sin(\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t)|-\\rangle_z \\right)$\n    Using the orthonormality of the basis states ($\\langle+|+\\rangle=1, \\langle-|\\rangle=1, \\langle-|+\\rangle=0$):\n    $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos^2(\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t) - \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sin^2(\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t)$\n    Using the trigonometric identity $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta$:\n    $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(2 \\cdot \\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$\n\n5.  **Determine the oscillation frequency.**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$\n    This is an oscillation of the form $A \\cos(\\omega t)$, where the amplitude is $A = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2}$ and the angular frequency is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n    The question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is this angular frequency $\\omega$.\n\n    **Alternative approach (Larmor Precession):**\n    Classically, a magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ in a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ experiences a torque $\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{\\mu} \\times \\vec{B}$. This torque causes a change in the angular momentum $\\vec{S}$ according to $\\frac{d\\vec{S}}{dt} = \\vec{\\tau}$. Since $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma\\vec{S}$, we have:\n    $\\frac{d\\vec{S}}{dt} = \\gamma\\vec{S} \\times \\vec{B}$\n    This equation describes the precession of the vector $\\vec{S}$ around the magnetic field vector $\\vec{B}$ at an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$.\n    In this problem, the initial spin expectation value is $\\langle \\vec{S}(0) \\rangle$ points along the Z-axis, while the new magnetic field points along the Y-axis. The spin vector will therefore precess around the Y-axis in the XZ-plane. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis will vary as a cosine function with a frequency equal to the precession frequency, $\\omega_L$.\n    Therefore, the oscillation frequency is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency is $\\gamma B$.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
