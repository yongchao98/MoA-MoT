    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid that forms an anhydride. The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (indicating two equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This description perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**, which is formed by the dehydration of *cis*-but-2-enedioic acid (maleic acid). Its formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system at positions C1 through C4. Each of these four carbons bears a methyl group. Position C5 is a CH₂ group. Its formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   The molecular formula of the adduct is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the molecular formula given for the products.\n    *   The reaction creates a bicyclic adduct, specifically a derivative of bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene.\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Major vs. Minor Product):**\n    *   The **endo rule** generally predicts that the kinetically favored product (usually the major product) is the one where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are oriented \"under\" the diene π-system (the *endo* position).\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by steric hindrance. In this case, the diene has four methyl groups on the reacting carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4). These methyl groups create significant steric bulk, particularly on the face required for the *endo* approach of the maleic anhydride.\n    *   The *exo* approach, where the anhydride approaches from the less hindered face, becomes kinetically favored.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific reaction, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *endo* adduct**. This is a crucial point for solving the problem.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures and Expected ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product structure is 1,4,5,6-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n    *   Let's predict the ¹H NMR signals for this symmetric molecule:\n        *   **Methyl protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups.\n            *   Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). These are on sp³ carbons. Let's call them **Me(bridgehead)**. They should appear as a 6H singlet at a lower chemical shift (~1.0 ppm).\n            *   Two methyl groups on the double bond carbons (C5, C6). These are on sp² carbons. Let's call them **Me(vinyl)**. They will be deshielded compared to the other methyls and appear as a 6H singlet at a higher chemical shift (~1.7 ppm).\n        *   **Anhydride protons:** There are two equivalent protons on the carbons originating from the maleic anhydride (C2, C3). They are adjacent to carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H(anhydride)**. They have no protons on adjacent carbons to couple with (C1 and C4 have methyl groups, not protons), so they should appear as a 2H singlet. Their chemical shift would be around 3-4 ppm (~3.5 ppm is given in the options).\n        *   **Bridge protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ group at C7 are diastereotopic and would likely give a complex multiplet, but they are not mentioned in the final options.\n\n5.  **Use the 2D NOESY Information to Distinguish Isomers:**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å apart).\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*exo* adduct) but absent or weak in the minor product (*endo* adduct). We need to find which pair of protons fits this description.\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C5=C6 double bond. This places the **H(anhydride)** protons spatially close to the **Me(vinyl)** groups. A NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side, tucked under the C5=C6 double bond. This places the **H(anhydride)** protons far from the **Me(vinyl)** groups. No significant NOESY correlation is expected between them.\n    *   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak connects **H(anhydride)** and **Me(vinyl)**.\n\n6.  **Match the Protons to the Signals in the Options:**\n    *   We are looking for the cross-peak between H(anhydride) and Me(vinyl).\n    *   H(anhydride) is the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   Me(vinyl) is the more deshielded methyl group, so it is the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   The cross-peak connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   Option A: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n    *   Option B: A 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n    *   Option C: A 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. Incorrect, this is between the two methyl groups.\n    *   Option D: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. **This matches our analysis perfectly.**\n\n<<<D>>>"
