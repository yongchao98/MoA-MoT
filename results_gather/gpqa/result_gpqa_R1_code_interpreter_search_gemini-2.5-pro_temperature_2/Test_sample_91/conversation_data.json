    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to calculate the enthalpy of formation.\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the given molecule: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **(CH3)2C=**: 2 C from the two CH3 groups + 1 C from the backbone = 3 C atoms. 2 * 3 = 6 H atoms.\n*   **=CH-**: 1 C atom, 1 H atom.\n*   **-CH2-**: 1 C atom, 2 H atoms.\n*   **-CH(CH3)-**: 1 C from the backbone + 1 C from the CH3 group = 2 C atoms. 1 H from the backbone + 3 H from the CH3 group = 4 H atoms.\n*   **-CH2-**: 1 C atom, 2 H atoms.\n*   **-CH=**: 1 C atom, 1 H atom.\n*   **=C(CH3)2**: 1 C from the backbone + 2 C from the two CH3 groups = 3 C atoms. 2 * 3 = 6 H atoms.\n\nLet's sum them up:\n*   **Total Carbon (C) atoms**: 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H) atoms**: 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### **2. Count the Number of Bonds**\n\nNext, we count the different types of covalent bonds in the molecule by analyzing its structure.\n\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C double bonds**: We can see two double bonds in the formula: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -C**H=C**(CH3)2. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds**: These are the bonds connecting carbon atoms that are not double bonds.\n    *   In the (CH3)2C= group: 2 bonds connecting the two CH3 groups to the main chain.\n    *   In the -CH(CH3)- group: 1 bond connecting the CH3 group to the main chain.\n    *   In the =C(CH3)2 group: 2 bonds connecting the two CH3 groups to the main chain.\n    *   Bonds along the main chain: C=**C-C**-C-**C-C**=C. There are single bonds between the C=C and -CH2-, -CH2- and -CH(CH3)-, -CH(CH3)- and -CH2-, and -CH2- and -CH=. That's 4 bonds.\n    *   Total C-C single bonds = 2 (at start) + 1 (side group) + 2 (at end) + 4 (in chain) = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nTo calculate the enthalpy of formation, we first find the energy required to break the reactants into gaseous atoms.\n*   **Atomization of Carbon**: 12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n    Energy required = 12 × (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **Atomization of Hydrogen**: 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n    This involves breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    Energy required = 11 × (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**:\n    ΔH_atom(reactants) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n### **4. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy released when one mole of the product is formed from its gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all the bond energies in the molecule.\n\n*   **Energy from C-H bonds**: 22 × (Bond energy of C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Energy from C-C bonds**: 9 × (Bond energy of C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   **Energy from C=C bonds**: 2 × (Bond energy of C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Total Bond Energy of Product**:\n    BE(product) = 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### **5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when forming the product from its atoms.\n\n*   **ΔHf = ΔH_atom(reactants) - BE(product)**\n*   ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **6. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options include answers in kJ/g. We need to convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g using the molar mass of C12H22.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22**:\n    M = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 g/mol + 22 g/mol = **166 g/mol**\n*   **Convert units**:\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the result is 11.45 kJ/g. This closely matches option D.\n\nI will use a python script to verify the arithmetic.\n```python\n# Constants from the problem statement\nenthalpy_atom_C = 1000\nbond_energy_HH = 100\nbond_energy_CC_single = 200\nbond_energy_CC_double = 300\nbond_energy_CH = 400\n\n# Atom counts for C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Bond counts for C12H22\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\nnum_CC_single_bonds = 9\nnum_CC_double_bonds = 2\n\n# Calculate enthalpy of atomization of reactants: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g)\nenthalpy_atom_reactants = (num_C * enthalpy_atom_C) + ((num_H / 2) * bond_energy_HH)\n\n# Calculate total bond energy of the product molecule C12H22\ntotal_bond_energy_product = (num_CH_bonds * bond_energy_CH) + \\\n                            (num_CC_single_bonds * bond_energy_CC_single) + \\\n                            (num_CC_double_bonds * bond_energy_CC_double)\n\n# Calculate enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_formation_per_mol = enthalpy_atom_reactants - total_bond_energy_product\n\n# Calculate molar mass of C12H22\nmolar_mass = (num_C * 12.0) + (num_H * 1.0)\n\n# Convert enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\nenthalpy_formation_per_gram = enthalpy_formation_per_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {enthalpy_formation_per_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Molar Mass (g/mol): {molar_mass}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {enthalpy_formation_per_gram}\")\n```\n>>>\nEnthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\nMolar Mass (g/mol): 166.0\nEnthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n<<<D>>>",
    "The step-by-step reasoning and calculations are as follows:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula**:\n    The chemical structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n    The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n2.  **Write the Formation Reaction**:\n    The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\n    12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n3.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants (ΔH_reactants)**:\n    This is the energy required to break the reactants into gaseous atoms.\n    *   For 12 moles of Carbon: 12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n        ΔH1 = 12 mol × (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n    *   For 11 moles of Hydrogen gas: 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n        This involves breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n        ΔH2 = 11 mol × (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n    *   Total enthalpy of atomization for reactants:\n        ΔH_reactants = ΔH1 + ΔH2 = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Bond Energy of the Product (ΔH_product)**:\n    This is the energy released when forming one mole of C12H22 from its gaseous atoms. We need to count the bonds in the molecule.\n    *   **C-H bonds**: There are 22 Hydrogen atoms, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n    *   **C=C bonds**: There are two double bonds: (CH3)2C=CH... and ...CH=C(CH3)2. So, 2 C=C bonds.\n    *   **C-C bonds**: The remaining carbon-carbon bonds are single bonds. The total number of C-C and C=C bonds is (Number of C atoms - 1) + (Number of rings) + (bonds to side groups). A simpler way is to count them from the structure:\n        - 2 C-C bonds connecting the first two CH3 groups.\n        - 1 C-C bond connecting the side CH3 group.\n        - 2 C-C bonds connecting the last two CH3 groups.\n        - 4 C-C bonds in the main chain.\n        Total C-C single bonds = 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 9.\n    *   Calculate total bond energy:\n        - Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n        - Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n        - Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n    *   Total bond energy of the product:\n        ΔH_product = 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = 11200 kJ\n\n5.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf) in kJ/mol**:\n    ΔHf = (Energy put in) - (Energy released)\n    ΔHf = ΔH_reactants - ΔH_product\n    ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n6.  **Convert to kJ/g**:\n    The question has options in kJ/g, so we need to convert the answer.\n    *   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n    *   Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g = (Enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol) / (Molar mass in g/mol)\n        ΔHf = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.445 kJ/g\n\nThis value matches the Python output and option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
