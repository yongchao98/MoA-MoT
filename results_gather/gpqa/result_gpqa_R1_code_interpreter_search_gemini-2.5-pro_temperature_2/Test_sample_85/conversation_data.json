    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Materials and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** The product for both reactions is a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester). The ring consists of one oxygen atom and five carbon atoms. The name indicates an ethyl group is at position 4. The chiral center of the product is this C4 atom.\n*   **Starting Materials (A and B):** The options suggest the starting material is an enantiomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: `(isobutyl)-O-CO-C(5)H2-C(4)H2-C(3)H(Et)-C(2)H2-C(1)OOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COO-iBu`).\n    *   The chiral center is C3, which bears the ethyl group.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reactions**\n\nThe key to this problem lies in the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, `LiBH4` and `BH3`.\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reagent:** `LiBH4` (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `LiBH4` reduces the ester group (`-COO-iBu` at C5) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH` at C1) is unaffected.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is `HO-C(5)H2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(1)OOH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid).\n    3.  The acid workup (`H+`) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization): the `-OH` group (from C5) attacks the `-COOH` group (at C1) to form the six-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not occur at the chiral center (C3). The 3D arrangement of groups around C3 is preserved (retention of 3D structure). We must check if the R/S label changes due to Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reagent:** `BH3` (borane) is also a selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, and does so much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `BH3` selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH` at C1) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group (`-COO-iBu` at C5) is unaffected.\n    2.  The intermediate is `(iBu)-O-CO-C(5)H2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(1)H2OH`.\n    3.  The acid workup (`H+`) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification: the `-OH` group (from the reduced C1) attacks the ester carbonyl (at C5) to form the same six-membered lactone product, eliminating isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to Reaction 1, the 3D structure at the chiral center is retained. We must again check the CIP priority rules.\n\n### **3. Detailed Stereochemical Analysis (CIP Priority Changes)**\n\nThis is the crucial step. We need to compare the CIP priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center in the starting material and the final product.\n\n**Starting Material Chiral Center (C3):**\nThe four groups are:\n*   `-H`\n*   `-CH2-CH3` (Ethyl)\n*   `-CH2-COOH` (Acid side)\n*   `-CH2-COO-iBu` (Ester side)\n\nTo assign priorities, we find the first point of difference moving away from C3. Comparing the acid and ester sides, `-CH2-CO-OH` vs `-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. The oxygen on the ester side is bonded to a carbon, while the oxygen on the acid side is bonded to a hydrogen. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, so the ester side gets higher priority.\nThe priority order is:\n1.  **`-CH2-COO-iBu` (Ester side)**\n2.  **`-CH2-COOH` (Acid side)**\n3.  `-CH2-CH3` (Ethyl)\n4.  `-H`\n\n**Product Chiral Center (C4):**\nThe four groups are:\n*   `-H`\n*   `-CH2-CH3` (Ethyl)\n*   `-CH2-C(=O)O-` (Path toward the lactone carbonyl)\n*   `-CH2-CH2-O-` (Path toward the lactone ether oxygen)\n\nTo assign priorities, we again look for the first point of difference. The carbon in the path to the carbonyl (`C2` in IUPAC numbering) is bonded to `(O, O, O)`. The carbon in the path to the ether oxygen (`C6` in IUPAC numbering) is bonded to `(O, H, H)`. Therefore, the path to the carbonyl has higher priority.\nThe priority order is:\n1.  **`-CH2-C(=O)O-` (Carbonyl path)**\n2.  **`-CH2-CH2-O-` (Ether path)**\n3.  `-CH2-CH3` (Ethyl)\n4.  `-H`\n\n**Connecting the Reactions:**\n\n*   **For Reaction 1 (A + LiBH4):**\n    *   The ester side (SM Prio 1) gets reduced and becomes the ether path (Product Prio 2).\n    *   The acid side (SM Prio 2) becomes the carbonyl path (Product Prio 1).\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped** (1→2 and 2→1). Swapping two groups in a chiral center inverts the configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction proceeds with formal **INVERSION** of the R/S label.\n    *   To get an (R) product, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n*   **For Reaction 2 (B + BH3):**\n    *   The ester side (SM Prio 1) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl path (Product Prio 1).\n    *   The acid side (SM Prio 2) gets reduced and becomes the ether path (Product Prio 2).\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups are **maintained** (1→1 and 2→2).\n    *   Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **RETENTION** of the R/S label.\n    *   To get an (S) product, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth reactions start with the (S) enantiomer. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
