    "*   **Analysis of the Product's Structure from NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the product from the given ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra. The starting material has the formula C₁₁H₁₂O, and the reaction with DABCO at high temperature is likely an isomerization, meaning the product has the same molecular formula.\n\n**¹H NMR Analysis:**\n*   The total number of protons is 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 12, which matches the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O.\n*   **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)**: These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This indicates the presence of two methyl (CH₃) groups that are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n*   **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, in the aromatic region is highly characteristic of a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n*   **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**: These are two doublets, each for 1 proton, in the region for vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond). The fact that they are doublets suggests they are on adjacent carbons and are splitting each other (a -CH=CH- moiety).\n\n**¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n*   The total number of carbon signals (counting carbons with the same shift) is 1+1+2+1+2+1+1+1+1 = 11, matching the formula C₁₁H₁₂O.\n*   **δ 197.7 (1C, s)**: This chemical shift is in the typical range for a carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically that of a ketone. An aldehyde carbonyl carbon would typically be further downfield (>200 ppm).\n*   **δ 21.3 (1C, s)** and **δ 28.4 (1C, s)**: These are signals for two distinct aliphatic carbons. Given the two methyl singlets in the ¹H NMR, these correspond to the two methyl group carbons. The signal at ~21 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring (a tolyl group), and the one at ~28 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl (an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH₃).\n*   **δ 126.9 (2C, s), δ 129.1 (2C, s), δ 141.5 (1C, s), δ 144.1 (1C, s), δ 130.3 (1C, s)**: These signals are in the aromatic/vinylic region.\n    *   The signals at δ 126.9 (2C) and δ 129.1 (2C) confirm the para-disubstituted ring, representing the four CH carbons on the ring.\n    *   The signals at δ 141.5 and δ 130.3 are the two quaternary carbons of the benzene ring (the ones with substituents).\n    *   The signals at δ 144.1 and δ 127.1 must be the two carbons of the C=C double bond.\n\n**Assembling the Product Structure:**\nBased on the analysis, the product contains:\n1.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  One of the substituents on the ring is a methyl group (CH₃), making it a para-tolyl group. This is supported by the ¹H NMR methyl singlet at δ 2.31 and the ¹³C NMR signal at δ 21.3.\n3.  The other major functional group is a methyl ketone (-C(=O)CH₃), supported by the C=O signal at δ 197.7, the second methyl singlet at δ 2.28, and its carbon signal at δ 28.4.\n4.  These two parts are connected by a -CH=CH- linker, identified from the vinylic proton signals.\n\nPutting it all together, the only structure that fits all the data is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\nStructure: `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\nThis structure's formula is C₁₁H₁₂O, confirming it is an isomer of the starting material.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reactant (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization of compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) to form 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This means Compound X must have the same atoms, just arranged differently. The key structural feature that is unlikely to be formed during the reaction is the p-tolyl group (p-methylphenyl). We should look for a reactant that already contains this group.\n\nLet's examine the options provided:\n*   **A) 2-styrylepoxide (2-styryloxirane):** The styryl group is C₆H₅-CH=CH-. The formula for 2-styryloxirane (C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂) is C₁₀H₁₀O, which is incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This compound (C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH₃)) contains a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), not a p-tolyl group. It cannot be the precursor to the product.\n*   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The 4-methylstyryl group is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`. The structure is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This compound has the correct formula C₁₁H₁₂O and contains the required p-tolyl group. It is a vinylic epoxide. It is well-known that vinylic epoxides can undergo rearrangement to form α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds under thermal or base-catalyzed conditions (DABCO is a base). This makes it a very plausible candidate.\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound (C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂) also contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group, so it cannot be the reactant.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\nThe product of the reaction contains a p-tolyl group. Of the choices provided, only option C, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, has a p-tolyl group and the correct molecular formula. The reaction is a base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinylic epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone. Therefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
