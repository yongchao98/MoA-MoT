    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the total mass of binary system_1 to the total mass of binary system_2. This can be expressed as finding the factor M1_total / M2_total.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1a (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1b (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2a (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2b (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    The problem involves spectroscopic binaries, as we are given radial velocity variations. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary (where spectral lines from both stars are observed), the total mass of the system (M_total = M1 + M2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2) by the following formula, which is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\n    (M1 + M2) * sin³(i) = P * (K1 + K2)³ / (2 * π * G)\n\n    Where:\n    *   M1 and M2 are the masses of the two stars.\n    *   `i` is the inclination angle of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Apply a Key Simplification:**\n    The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. For eclipses to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the binary system. This implies that the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees.\n    *   If `i` ≈ 90°, then sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1.\n    *   This simplifies the mass formula to:\n        M_total ≈ P * (K1 + K2)³ / (2 * π * G)\n\n5.  **Formulate the Ratio:**\n    We need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1_total) to the total mass of system_2 (M2_total).\n\n    M1_total / M2_total = [ P1 * (K1a + K1b)³ / (2 * π * G) ] / [ P2 * (K2a + K2b)³ / (2 * π * G) ]\n\n    The constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` is present in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. The ratio simplifies to:\n\n    M1_total / M2_total = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Required Values:**\n    *   For system_1, the total velocity amplitude is K1_total = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s.\n    *   For system_2, the total velocity amplitude is K2_total = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s.\n\n7.  **Substitute and Compute the Ratio:**\n    Now, plug the numerical values into the ratio formula. The units (years for period, km/s for velocity) are consistent for both systems, so no conversion is necessary as they will cancel out.\n\n    M1_total / M2_total = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³)\n    M1_total / M2_total = 2 * (15/25)³\n    M1_total / M2_total = 2 * (3/5)³\n    M1_total / M2_total = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M1_total / M2_total = 54 / 125\n\n    To get a decimal value for comparison with the options, perform the division. I will use a Python script for this simple calculation.\n\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_total = 10.0 + 5.0  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2_total = 15.0 + 10.0  # km/s\n\n# The total mass M is proportional to P * (K_total)^3.\n# We calculate the ratio M1/M2. The proportionality constant cancels out.\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K1_total)**3) / (P2 * (K2_total)**3)\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n\n<execute_code>\n0.432\n</execute_code>\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The calculated ratio is 0.432. This means that system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) ~ 0.7\n    B) ~ 1.2\n    C) ~ 0.4\n    D) ~ 0.6\n\n    The calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
