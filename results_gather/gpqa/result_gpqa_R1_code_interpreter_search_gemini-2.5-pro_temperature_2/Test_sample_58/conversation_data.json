    "This problem requires determining the final pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The approach involves calculating the initial moles of all acidic and basic species, neutralizing them in a specific order, and then calculating the pH from the concentration of the species remaining in excess.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = 0.400 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol HCl\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely: HCl -> H+ + Cl-.\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.08 mol\n\n*   **Moles of Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles = 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates completely: Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-.\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 * 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n**Step 2: Neutralize the strong acid and strong base.**\n\nThe H+ ions from the strong acid (HCl) will react with the OH- ions from the strong base (Ba(OH)2) first.\nThe reaction is: H+ + OH- -> H2O\n\n*   Initial moles of H+ = 0.08 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH- = 0.18 mol\n\nSince there are more moles of OH- than H+, all the H+ will be consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\nAfter this reaction, the solution contains 0.10 moles of OH- (strong base) and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH (weak acid).\n\n**Step 3: Neutralize the remaining strong base with the weak acid.**\n\nThe remaining OH- will react with the weak acid, CH3COOH.\nThe reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n\n*   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH- = 0.10 mol\n\nSince there are more moles of OH- than CH3COOH, all the CH3COOH will be consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of CH3COO- (conjugate base) formed = 0.05 mol\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH-). The pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of this excess OH-.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final concentration of OH- and the pH.**\n\nFirst, calculate the total volume of the solution.\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\nNext, calculate the concentration of the excess OH-.\n*   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n*   [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\nNow, calculate the pOH.\n*   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n*   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\nFinally, calculate the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14.\n*   pH = 14 - pOH\n*   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
