    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the final product.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the Starting Material**\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting compound is C8H9NO.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Data:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which, according to the n+1 rule, means it's adjacent to a carbon with 2 hydrogens (a -CH2- group). This confirms a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2). The broadness is due to nitrogen's quadrupole moment and chemical exchange.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a -CH2- group. It's a doublet (d), confirming it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH), which is the aldehyde proton. This supports the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an acetaldehyde group (-CH2-CHO).\n    *   Putting these pieces together in a para arrangement gives the structure of **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**, also known as p-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (benzene ring) + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) + NH2 = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n**Structure of Starting Material (A):**\n```\n      CHO\n      |\n      CH2\n      |\n      / \\\n     || ||\n    //  \\\\\n   --C C--\n  /  C C  \\\n ||  |   ||\n --C C--\n    \\\\ //\n      |\n     NH2\n```\n\n**Part 2: Analyzing the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Reaction with NaNO2 + HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n\n    **Intermediate (B):**\n    ```\n          CHO\n          |\n          CH2\n          |\n          / \\\n         || ||\n        //  \\\\\n       --C C--\n      /  C C  \\\n     ||  |   ||\n     --C C--\n        \\\\ //\n          |\n         N2+ Cl-\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reaction with H2O:** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water (hydrolysis), especially upon gentle warming. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n\n    **Intermediate (C): 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (or p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde)**\n    ```\n          CHO\n          |\n          CH2\n          |\n          / \\\n         || ||\n        //  \\\\\n       --C C--\n      /  C C  \\\n     ||  |   ||\n     --C C--\n        \\\\ //\n          |\n         OH\n    ```\n\n3.  **Reaction with aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves a base (KOH) and heat applied to an aldehyde that possesses α-hydrogens (the hydrogens on the -CH2- group next to the -CHO group). These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n\n    *   **Step 3a (Aldol Addition):** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule of the aldehyde (C) to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of aldehyde (C). Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n        *   The addition product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxybutanal**. This corresponds to option (B), but since heat is supplied, the reaction doesn't stop here.\n\n    *   **Step 3b (Dehydration):** The aldol addition product is heated in the basic solution. This causes elimination of a water molecule (dehydration). The α-hydrogen is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group leaves, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. The resulting product is a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Final Product (D):**\nThe structure after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n```\n                CHO\n                |\n(4-HO-Ph) ----- C\n               ||\n                C ----- CH2 ----- (4-HO-Ph)\n                |\n                H\n```\nLet's match this structure with the given options:\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure and stereochemistry.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating.\n*   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This perfectly matches the name of our derived final product from the aldol condensation.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure; the hydroxyl groups are missing, and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
