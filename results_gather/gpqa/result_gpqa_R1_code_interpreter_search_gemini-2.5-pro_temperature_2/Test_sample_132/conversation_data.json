    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    *   KH2PO4 dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates completely into 2 Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2 H2O.\n    *   The key species for the acid-base equilibrium are the conjugate acid-base pair H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of each species:**\n    *   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L.\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = (mass of KH2PO4) / (molar mass of KH2PO4)\n        = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = (mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O) / (molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O)\n        = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations:**\n    *   Concentration of H2PO4- ([H2PO4-]) = moles / volume\n        = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Concentration of HPO4^2- ([HPO4^2-]) = moles / volume\n        = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n4.  **Determine the [H+] of the buffer solution:**\n    *   The solution contains a conjugate acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), forming a buffer. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻      (Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸)\n    *   We can use the equilibrium expression for Ka₂ to find the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]:\n        Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] = 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻):**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This is the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid:\n        HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻      (Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²)\n    *   We can use the equilibrium expression for Ka₃:\n        Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for the orthophosphate concentration [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻]) / [H⁺]\n    *   Since the amount of HPO₄²⁻ that dissociates is very small (due to the very small Ka₃), we can assume its equilibrium concentration is approximately equal to its initial concentration (0.02809 M).\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹² * 0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nTo get a more precise value, let's use a Python script for the calculations.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\n\n# Masses\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\n\n# Volume in Liters\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000\n\n# Dissociation constants\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Calculate moles\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Calculate [H+] using the buffer equation derived from Ka2\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Calculate [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = (Ka3 * conc_HPO4_2minus) / conc_H_plus\n\nprint(f'{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}')\n```\n<execute_result>\n6.24e-07\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
