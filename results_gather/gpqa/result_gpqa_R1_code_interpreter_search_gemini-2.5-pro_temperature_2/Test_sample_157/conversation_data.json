    "*   **Analyze the core concepts:**\n    *   **Transcription Factor:** A protein that controls the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA. The one in this problem functions as a dimer.\n    *   **Dimerization:** The process where two protein subunits (monomers) bind together to form a functional complex (a dimer). This is mediated by the dimerization domain.\n    *   **Dominant-Negative Mutation:** This is a specific type of mutation.\n        *   **Dominant:** The mutation's effect is seen even when a normal, wild-type allele is present (in a heterozygote).\n        *   **Negative:** The effect is a loss of function.\n        *   **Mechanism:** A dominant-negative mutation produces a faulty protein product that not only is non-functional itself but also actively interferes with the function of the normal protein produced from the wild-type allele. In proteins that form dimers or other multimers, this often happens because the mutant subunit binds to the wild-type subunit, creating a non-functional complex. This \"poisons\" the pool of wild-type proteins.\n\n*   **Apply the concepts to the scenario:**\n    *   We have a heterozygous individual with one wild-type (WT) allele and one allele with mutation Y in the dimerization domain.\n    *   The cell produces both WT subunits and Y subunits.\n    *   For the transcription factor to work, two subunits must form a WT-WT dimer.\n    *   Because the Y subunit has a mutation in its dimerization domain and exhibits a dominant-negative effect, it interferes with the WT subunit.\n    *   Let's consider how this interference could manifest physically (the molecular phenotype).\n\n*   **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   **A) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** Incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation is by definition a *loss-of-function*, not a gain-of-function.\n    *   **B) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** Incorrect. While this would cause a loss-of-function, the primary mechanism of a dominant-negative mutation is interference, not simply causing the protein to be degraded. Degradation is more associated with recessive mutations or haploinsufficiency, where the problem is a lack of sufficient protein, not an interfering one.\n    *   **C) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** Incorrect. If mutation Y completely prevented dimerization, the Y subunits would be inert and unable to interact with the WT subunits. The WT subunits would be free to form WT-WT dimers. This might lead to reduced function (haploinsufficiency) but not a dominant-negative effect where the mutant *interferes* with the wild-type. It certainly wouldn't result in a wild-type phenotype if the effect is strong enough to be called dominant.\n    *   **D) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** This is the most likely scenario. A missense mutation in an interaction domain like the dimerization domain can cause the protein to misfold. Misfolded proteins often expose hydrophobic regions that make them \"sticky,\" leading them to clump together into non-functional aggregates. The mutant Y protein can not only self-aggregate but can also trap the functional WT protein in these aggregates through its faulty dimerization domain. This sequestration of the WT protein into useless aggregates effectively poisons the function of the WT protein, which is the hallmark of a dominant-negative effect. This leads to an overall loss of transcription factor function.\n\n<<<D>>>"
