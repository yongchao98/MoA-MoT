    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone.\n    *   It possesses a single chiral center at carbon C5, with an (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a powerful reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n\n3.  **Products' Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The original chiral center at C5 is not involved in the reaction and its (S) configuration is retained.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces (re or si face).\n    *   Since the molecule is already chiral, these two faces are diastereotopic. The attack will produce two different stereoisomers, which are diastereomers to each other.\n    *   The products are **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** and **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**.\n    *   Thus, Reaction I yields **two distinct compounds** that are diastereomers.\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a diketone with the structure CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n\n2.  **Reaction:** It's treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The \"excess\" ensures both ketone groups are reduced.\n\n3.  **Products' Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   New chiral centers are created at C2 and C4.\n    *   Three possible stereoisomers are formed:\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        *   **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. Note that (2S, 4R) is the same molecule as (2R, 4S) due to this symmetry.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n    *   Thus, Reaction II yields **three distinct compounds**: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined. The final mixture contains five different stereoisomers in total:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   The products of Reaction I are two diastereomers. They will be separated. → **2 peaks**.\n*   The products of Reaction II are a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The enantiomeric pair will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, will have a different polarity and elute separately. → **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇ ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C₅ diols) are structurally very different and will have significantly different polarities. Thus, the peaks from Reaction I will not overlap with the peaks from Reaction II.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase which interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   It can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n*   Our mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers. Each one will interact differently with the chiral column.\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol → **1 peak**\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol → **1 peak**\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol → **1 peak**\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol → **1 peak**\n*   meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol → **1 peak** (Meso compounds, though achiral, are also separated from their chiral diastereomers).\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will exhibit **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC** and **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
