    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\n*   **Vector Field (f):** The problem describes a vector field `f(r)`.\n    *   Its magnitude is `f(r) = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the radial distance from the origin.\n    *   Its direction is purely radial, pointing away from the origin.\n    *   In vector form, using spherical coordinates, this is written as `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   **Integral to Evaluate:** We need to find the value of the volume integral of the divergence of this field: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n*   **Volume of Integration (V):** The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\nThis setup is physically analogous to calculating the total charge inside a sphere of radius R given the electric field of a point charge at the origin (up to a constant factor, according to Gauss's Law in electromagnetism).\n\n### 2. Choosing the Method\n\nThere are two primary methods to solve this:\n1.  **Direct Calculation:** Compute the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then integrate it over the volume `V`.\n2.  **Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem):** Convert the volume integral of the divergence into a surface integral of the field over the boundary of the volume.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem is generally simpler for this type of problem, especially because the vector field has a singularity (it becomes infinite) at the origin (`r=0`), which is inside our volume of integration. Let's use the Divergence Theorem.\n\n### 3. Applying the Divergence Theorem\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the closed surface that bounds the volume `V`. In this case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which points outwards from the surface.\n\n### 4. Setting up the Surface Integral\n\n1.  **Field at the surface (S):** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n\n2.  **Surface Element (dS):** In spherical coordinates, the differential surface area element on a sphere of constant radius `R` is:\n    `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`\n    The direction of `dS` is `r̂` because it must point perpendicularly outwards from the spherical surface.\n\n3.  **The Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂ ]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies significantly. The `R^2` terms cancel out:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) dθ dφ * (r̂ ⋅ r̂)`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Integral\n\nNow we need to integrate this result over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for integration in spherical coordinates are:\n*   `φ` (azimuthal angle) goes from `0` to `2π`.\n*   `θ` (polar angle) goes from `0` to `π`.\n\nThe integral is:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nWe can solve this by separating the integrals:\n`= ( ∫_{0}^{2π} dφ ) * ( ∫_{0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ )`\n\n*   **First integral (φ):**\n    `∫_{0}^{2π} dφ = [φ]_{0}^{2π} = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n\n*   **Second integral (θ):**\n    `∫_{0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_{0}^{π} = (-cos(π)) - (-cos(0)) = (-(-1)) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n*   **Final Result:**\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0`), which is a characteristic feature of a `1/r^2` field originating from a point source.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 0\nC) 1\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe calculated answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
