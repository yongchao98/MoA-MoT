    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is considered the \"stationary\" frame of reference. We need to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. We are given the time elapsed in this frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Variables:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, **v** = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), **Δt₀** = 50 s. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is moving along with the event.\n    *   The speed of light, **c** ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Understand the Concept of Time Dilation:**\n    According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time passes slower for a moving object relative to a stationary observer. The relationship between the time measured in the stationary frame (Δt) and the proper time in the moving frame (Δt₀) is given by the time dilation formula:\n    \n    Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    \n    where **γ** (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n    \n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    \n    First, let's calculate the ratio v/c:\n    v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 1/5 = 0.2\n    \n    Now, square this value:\n    (v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04\n    \n    Substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time Elapsed in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    Now we can find the time that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame using the time dilation formula:\n    \n    Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √0.96) * 50 s\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame:**\n    The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d) is the velocity of the ejecta (v) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):\n    \n    d = v * Δt\n    d = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / √0.96) * 50 s]\n    d = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96\n    d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    To get the final numerical answer, we need to calculate the value of 3,000,000 / √0.96. We can use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # Velocity in km/s\ndt0 = 50     # Proper time in seconds\nc = 300000   # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta_squared = (v/c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate the dilated time in the Galaxy's frame\ndt = gamma * dt0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n>>>3061862.1784789723\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. This is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem involves concepts from special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### **1. Identify the Frames of Reference**\n*   **Galaxy Reference Frame (S):** This is considered the stationary frame. We need to calculate the distance traveled as measured by an observer in this frame.\n*   **Ejecta Reference Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame. We are given the time elapsed in this frame.\n\n### **2. Identify the Knowns and Unknowns**\n*   Relative velocity, **v** = 60,000 km/s.\n*   Speed of light, **c** ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n*   Proper time (time in the moving frame), **Δt₀** = 50 s. This is the time measured on a clock traveling with the ejecta.\n*   The unknown is the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame, **d**.\n\n### **3. Apply the Principle of Time Dilation**\nAccording to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (**Δt**) for events happening in a moving frame (the ejecta) than an observer in the moving frame. This effect is called time dilation.\n\nThe formula for the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame is:\nd = v * Δt\n\nWe first need to find **Δt**, the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame corresponding to the 50 seconds that passed in the ejecta's frame. The formula for time dilation is:\nΔt = γ * Δt₀\n\nwhere **γ** (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n### **4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nFirst, we calculate the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light, squared:\n(v/c)² = (60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s)² = (1/5)² = 0.2² = 0.04\n\nNow, we calculate γ:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n\n### **5. Calculate the Distance (d)**\nNow we can combine the formulas to find the distance **d**:\nd = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)\nd = 60,000 km/s * (1 / √0.96) * 50 s\nd = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96 km\nd = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km\n\n### **6. Compute the Final Value**\nUsing the value calculated by the Python script:\nd ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\nThis value is very close to option A. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the options provided.\n\n*   Calculated value: 3,061,862 km\n*   Option A: 3,060,000 km\n*   Option D (3,000,000 km) would be the answer if relativistic effects were ignored (d = v * t = 60,000 * 50). Since the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%), relativistic effects must be included.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the one that accounts for time dilation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
