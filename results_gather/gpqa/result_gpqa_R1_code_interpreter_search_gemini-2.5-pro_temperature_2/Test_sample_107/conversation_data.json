    "The user wants me to compare the order of magnitude of two energy values:\n1.  The paramagnetic coupling energy (Zeeman effect) for an electron in a magnetic field.\n2.  The energy of a specific electronic transition in a Hydrogen atom.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n**1. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\langle H \\rangle$)**\n\nThe energy shift due to the paramagnetic coupling (the linear Zeeman effect) is given by the formula:\n$\\langle H \\rangle = \\Delta E_B = m \\cdot \\mu_B \\cdot B$\n\nWhere:\n*   $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem states to use \"small values of m\", so we'll use $m=1$ to evaluate the order of magnitude.\n*   $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, a physical constant.\n*   $B$ is the magnitude of the external magnetic field, given as $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$.\n\nWe need the value of the Bohr magneton, which is $\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}$ (in Joules per Tesla) or $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$ (in electron-volts per Tesla).\n\nUsing $m=1$ and $B=1 \\, \\text{T}$, we can calculate the energy:\n$\\langle H \\rangle = 1 \\cdot (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\cdot 1 \\, \\text{T}$\n$\\langle H \\rangle = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nSo, the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately $10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $h$ is Planck's constant.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n*   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light, given as $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$.\n\nA useful combination for this calculation is the product $hc$, which is approximately $1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}$.\nFirst, convert the wavelength to nanometers:\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$\n\nNow, calculate the energy in electron-volts (eV):\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nSo, the order of magnitude of the transition energy is approximately $1 \\, \\text{eV}$.\n*(Note: This wavelength corresponds to the Balmer series transition from n=4 to n=2 in the Hydrogen atom, which is a typical electronic transition energy.)*\n\n**3. Compare the Two Energies**\n\nNow we compare the orders of magnitude of the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\langle H \\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n$\\frac{\\langle H \\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is very small ($ \\approx 10^{-5}$), which means that the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $\\langle H \\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
