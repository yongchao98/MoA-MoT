    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   The alkoxide intermediate, [CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃], needs a proton (H⁺) to become the final hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming the cyanohydrin product.\n    *   Reagent **A** must be a source of protons. Looking at the options for A, we have NaHSO₃ and H₃O⁺.\n    *   H₃O⁺ represents an acidic medium, which serves as the required proton source. While adding strong acid directly to NaCN can be dangerous (produces toxic HCN gas), the reaction is typically performed by either using HCN directly or by adding acid to a solution of the ketone and NaCN. Therefore, H₃O⁺ correctly represents the required acidic conditions/proton donor for the protonation step.\n    *   NaHSO₃ is sodium bisulfite. While it reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products, it is not the standard reagent for promoting cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   Thus, **A = H₃O⁺**. This narrows down our choices to B and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as **nitrile hydrolysis**.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base in the presence of water (and often heat).\n    *   The question specifies B (H₂O) as the reagent system. We need to identify reagent **B**.\n    *   Looking at the remaining options for B (from choices B and D), we have CH₃COOH (acetic acid) and HCl (hydrochloric acid).\n    *   **HCl** is a strong acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   **CH₃COOH** is a weak acid. While it could theoretically catalyze the reaction, it would be much slower and less efficient than a strong acid like HCl. For this transformation to proceed effectively, a strong acid is the standard and appropriate choice.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have determined that A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
