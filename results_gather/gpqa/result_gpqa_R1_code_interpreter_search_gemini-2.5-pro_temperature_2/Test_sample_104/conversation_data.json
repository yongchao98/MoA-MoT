    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Scenario**\n\nWe have a star that is rotating. One of its hemispheres is \"unspotted\" (pristine) and the other is \"spotty\". The spotty hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by cooler, dark spots. This rotation causes the star's observed brightness to change periodically.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk of the star has the effective temperature, T_eff.\n*   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotty hemisphere is facing the observer. In this view, 20% of the visible disk is covered by cool spots (at temperature T_spot) and the remaining 80% is at the normal effective temperature (T_eff).\n\nWe need to calculate the amplitude of this brightness variation. This amplitude is the fractional change in flux: (F_max - F_min) / F_max.\n\n**2. Formulate the Flux Calculation**\n\nAccording to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the energy radiated per unit area (flux or intensity) from a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (I ∝ T⁴). The total observed flux is this intensity integrated over the visible area of the star's disk.\n\n*   Let the area of the star's visible disk be A_disk.\n*   Let a proportionality constant be 'k'.\n\nSo, the flux expressions are:\n*   F_max = A_disk * k * T_eff⁴\n*   F_min = (Area_unspotted * k * T_eff⁴) + (Area_spotty * k * T_spot⁴)\n\nGiven the filling factor (f_spot = 20% = 0.2), when the spotty side faces us:\n*   Area_spotty = f_spot * A_disk = 0.2 * A_disk\n*   Area_unspotted = (1 - f_spot) * A_disk = 0.8 * A_disk\n\nTherefore:\n*   F_min = (0.8 * A_disk * k * T_eff⁴) + (0.2 * A_disk * k * T_spot⁴)\n*   F_min = A_disk * k * (0.8 * T_eff⁴ + 0.2 * T_spot⁴)\n\n**3. Calculate the Amplitude of Variation due to Spots**\n\nThe amplitude is the relative drop in flux:\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\nAmplitude = [ A_disk*k*T_eff⁴ - A_disk*k*(0.8*T_eff⁴ + 0.2*T_spot⁴) ] / (A_disk*k*T_eff⁴)\n\nThe terms `A_disk` and `k` cancel out:\nAmplitude = [ T_eff⁴ - 0.8*T_eff⁴ - 0.2*T_spot⁴ ] / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = [ 0.2*T_eff⁴ - 0.2*T_spot⁴ ] / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = 0.2 * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = 0.2 * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]\n\nNow, we plug in the given temperature values:\n*   T_eff = 6000 K\n*   T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\nAmplitude = 0.2 * [ 1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴ ]\nAmplitude = 0.2 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]\n\n**4. Compare with an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nThe problem asks what size exoplanet would produce the same amplitude signal. The drop in brightness during an exoplanet transit (the \"transit depth\") is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nWe set the transit depth equal to the amplitude of the spot modulation:\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.2 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]\n\nTherefore, the relative radius is:\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.2 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ] )\n\n**5. Compute the Final Value**\n\nTo get the numerical answer, we'll perform the calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Star and spot properties\nfilling_factor = 0.20\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0 # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# 1. Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)\namplitude = filling_factor * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# 2. This amplitude is equivalent to the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet\n# Transit Depth = (R_planet / R_star)^2\n# Therefore, R_planet / R_star = sqrt(Transit Depth)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\n# Print the final result, rounded to two decimal places to match the options\nprint(f\"The required relative radius (R_pl / R_star) is: {relative_radius:.2f}\")\n```\n\nExecuting the code gives the following result:\n\n```text\nThe required relative radius (R_pl / R_star) is: 0.32\n```\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks us to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (R_pl/R_star) that would produce the same dimming effect as a large spotted region on a rotating star.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Brightness Drop from Starspots**\n\nFirst, we need to quantify the periodic variation in brightness caused by the starspots. The brightness (or more accurately, the flux `F`) of the star is proportional to the area of the emitting surface and the fourth power of its temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ A * T⁴).\n\n1.  **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible disk of the star has an effective temperature `T_eff`.\n    `F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff⁴`\n    where `A_disk` is the area of the star's visible disk.\n\n2.  **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotty hemisphere faces the observer. In this view, 20% of the visible disk (the filling factor `f_spot = 0.2`) is covered by cool spots at temperature `T_spot`, and the remaining 80% is at the normal effective temperature `T_eff`.\n    `F_min ∝ ( (1 - f_spot) * A_disk * T_eff⁴ ) + ( f_spot * A_disk * T_spot⁴ )`\n    `F_min ∝ A_disk * [ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴ ]`\n\n3.  **Amplitude of Variation:** The amplitude of the signal is the fractional drop in brightness.\n    `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\n    Substituting the expressions for `F_max` and `F_min` (the proportionality constants and `A_disk` cancel out):\n    `Amplitude = ( T_eff⁴ - [ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴ ] ) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude = ( T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴ ) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude = ( f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴ ) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude = f_spot * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]`\n\n4.  **Plugging in the values:**\n    *   Effective temperature `T_eff` = 6000 K\n    *   Spot temperature `T_spot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Filling factor `f_spot` = 20% = 0.2\n\n    `Amplitude = 0.2 * [ 1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴ ]`\n    `Amplitude = 0.2 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]`\n    `Amplitude ≈ 0.2 * [ 1 - 0.48225 ]`\n    `Amplitude ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775`\n    `Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`\n\nSo, the starspots cause a brightness drop of approximately 10.36%.\n\n### **Step 2: Relate the Brightness Drop to a Planetary Transit**\n\nNext, we need to find the size of a planet that would cause this same brightness drop. When a planet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The fractional drop in brightness (the transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n`Transit Depth = Area_planet / Area_star`\n`Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)`\n`Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nwhere `R_pl` is the planet's radius and `R_star` is the star's radius.\n\n### **Step 3: Equate the two scenarios and solve**\n\nTo produce the same amplitude signal, the transit depth must equal the amplitude of the spot modulation.\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius `R_pl / R_star`:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative radius is ~0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
