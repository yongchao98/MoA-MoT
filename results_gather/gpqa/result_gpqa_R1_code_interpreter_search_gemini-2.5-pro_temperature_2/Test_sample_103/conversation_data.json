    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets, let's call it $P_2 / P_1$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   Two identical stars: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   Two identical planets: $M_{planet1} = M_{planet2}$.\n    *   Detection method: Radial Velocity (RV).\n    *   Measurement: Periodic wavelength shift of a spectral line.\n    *   Planet #1: Maximum shift $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom (mÅ).\n    *   Planet #2: Maximum shift $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom (mÅ).\n    *   Orbits are circular.\n\n3.  **Relate the Measurement to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The RV method measures the Doppler shift of starlight. The formula for the non-relativistic Doppler shift is $\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v_r / c$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity of the star and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   The maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is the amplitude of the velocity curve, denoted by $K$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max} \\propto K$.\n    *   From the given data, we can find the ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n        $K_1 / K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 5 / 7$.\n\n4.  **Find the Relationship between Velocity Amplitude (K) and Orbital Period (P):**\n    *   For a star of mass $M_s$ with a planet of mass $M_p$ in a circular orbit of period $P$, the star itself orbits the common center of mass.\n    *   The velocity amplitude of the star is given by the formula (assuming the orbital plane's inclination $i$ is the same for both systems or we are observing them edge-on, where $\\sin(i) = 1$):\n        $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p}{(M_s + M_p)^{2/3}}$\n        (This formula combines the star's orbital velocity equation with Kepler's Third Law).\n\n5.  **Simplify the Relationship using the Problem's Constraints:**\n    *   The problem states that the masses of the stars are identical ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$) and the masses of the planets are identical ($M_{p1} = M_{p2}$).\n    *   This means the mass-dependent part of the equation, $\\frac{M_p}{(M_s + M_p)^{2/3}}$, is the same constant for both systems.\n    *   The physical constants $2\\pi$ and $G$ are also the same.\n    *   Therefore, the relationship between $K$ and $P$ simplifies to a proportionality:\n        $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ or $K \\propto 1 / P^{1/3}$.\n\n6.  **Use the Proportionality to Find the Ratio of Periods:**\n    *   We can write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes in terms of the periods:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(P_2)^{-1/3}}{(P_1)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   We already know the ratio of the K values: $K_2 / K_1 = 7 / 5$.\n    *   Now, we set the two expressions for the ratio equal:\n        $\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n7.  **Solve for the Desired Ratio ($P_2 / P_1$):**\n    *   To isolate the period ratio, we need to cube both sides of the equation:\n        $\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    *   The question asks for \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which corresponds to the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. So, we need to invert the fraction:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value:**\n    *   To get the decimal value, I'll perform the calculation. This can be done with a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the final ratio P2/P1\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_code>\n\n9.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The calculation shows that $P_2 / P_1 \\approx 0.364$. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1 (i.e., it is shorter). This matches option C. The inverse relationship ($K \\propto 1/P^{1/3}$) makes physical sense: a larger velocity amplitude implies a stronger gravitational tug and thus a closer, shorter-period orbit. Since planet #2 induces a larger velocity shift ($K_2 > K_1$), it must have a shorter period ($P_2 < P_1$).\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. As a planet orbits a star, it causes the star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble results in the star moving slightly towards and away from us, causing its light to be blueshifted and redshifted, respectively. The magnitude of this shift is proportional to the star's radial velocity.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Velocity:** The observed maximum periodic shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the maximum radial velocity of the star, also known as the velocity semi-amplitude ($K$).\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda \\propto K$\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n3.  **Relate Velocity Amplitude to Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude ($K$) is given by the formula:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{(M_s + M_p)^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $M_s$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $M_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Relation Using the Problem's Constraints:** The problem states that the masses of the stars are identical ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$), and the masses of the planets are identical ($M_{p1} = M_{p2}$). We also assume the systems are observed under similar inclinations, so $\\sin(i)$ is a constant factor that cancels out. Therefore, all terms in the equation except for the period ($P$) are the same for both systems. This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n    *   $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ or $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\n5.  **Form the Ratio and Solve for the Period Ratio:** We can now write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes in terms of the periods:\n    *   $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(P_2)^{-1/3}}{(P_1)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   We already found that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$. Let's substitute this value into the equation:\n        $\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   To find the period ratio, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n        $\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    *   The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. So we need to take the reciprocal of our result:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{1}{(7/5)^3} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods (P2/P1)\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.364. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
