    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of product 4 and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Bromination of cyclohexanone**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone and Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The reaction is typically carried out under acidic conditions, but even without specified conditions, the most common outcome of treating a simple ketone like cyclohexanone with one equivalent of bromine is the substitution of one alpha-hydrogen with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** The alpha-carbons are C2 and C6, which are equivalent. Therefore, the product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n \n\n**Step 2: Heating product 1 with sodium hydroxide**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-bromocyclohexanone (an α-halo ketone) and Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** An α-halo ketone with available protons on the α'-carbon (the other alpha-carbon, C6) undergoes a classic named reaction called the **Favorskii rearrangement** when treated with a strong base like NaOH. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, which then undergoes nucleophilic attack by hydroxide and ring-opening to form a ring-contracted carboxylate salt. While an elimination reaction to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone is also possible, the Favorskii rearrangement is the characteristic reaction for this class of compounds, and the subsequent reaction steps are consistent with its product.\n*   **Mechanism Outline:**\n    1.  OH⁻ removes a proton from C6.\n    2.  The resulting enolate attacks C2, displacing Br⁻ to form a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one intermediate.\n    3.  OH⁻ attacks the carbonyl carbon.\n    4.  The tetrahedral intermediate collapses, cleaving the C1-C6 bond to form the more stable cyclopentane ring. This results in the sodium salt of cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    5.  A subsequent acidic workup (implied before the next step) protonates the carboxylate.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n \n\n**Step 3: Treatment of product 2 with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid and thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) with pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** The -COOH group is converted to a -COCl group, forming cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n \n\n**Step 4: Treatment of product 3 with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride and Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OᵗBu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlH(OᵗBu)₃ is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used for the partial reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. A stronger reducing agent like LiAlH₄ would reduce the acid chloride all the way to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** The acid chloride is reduced to an aldehyde. The product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n \n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Chemically distinct hydrogens will have different chemical shifts in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C-CHO) and the carbon it is attached to (C1), bisecting the C3-C4 bond (in a time-averaged sense).\n*   Because of this symmetry:\n    *   C2 and C5 are chemically equivalent.\n    *   C3 and C4 are chemically equivalent.\n\nNow let's count the sets of distinct protons:\n\n1.  **Aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment, attached to a carbonyl carbon. This is **one** distinct type.\n2.  **Methine proton (C1-H):** The hydrogen on the carbon to which the aldehyde is attached (C1). This hydrogen is unique. This is a **second** distinct type.\n3.  **Methylene protons on C2 and C5:** The two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because of their fixed spatial relationship (cis/trans) to the substituent on C1. The same is true for the protons on C5. Due to the plane of symmetry, the \"cis\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C5, and the \"trans\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C5. This gives **two more** distinct types of hydrogens.\n4.  **Methylene protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. Their relationship to the aldehyde group, although more distant, is different. By symmetry, the protons on C3 are equivalent to their counterparts on C4. This gives another **two** distinct types of hydrogens.\n\n**Summary of Distinct Hydrogen Environments:**\n*   Signal 1: Aldehyde-H (1H)\n*   Signal 2: C1-H (1H)\n*   Signal 3: C2/C5-H (cis-protons) (2H)\n*   Signal 4: C2/C5-H (trans-protons) (2H)\n*   Signal 5: C3/C4-H (one set of diastereotopic protons) (2H)\n*   Signal 6: C3/C4-H (the other set of diastereotopic protons) (2H)\n\nTotaling these up, we have 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms."
