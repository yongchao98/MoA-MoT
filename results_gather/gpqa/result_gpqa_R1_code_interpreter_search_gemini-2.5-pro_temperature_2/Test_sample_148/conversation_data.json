    "*   **Analyze the NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of two distinct peaks for a single proton (the alpha-proton) indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   The fact that these peaks have \"roughly equal integrals\" suggests that the two molecular species creating these environments are present in an approximately 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the splitting is not due to coupling with adjacent protons. This reinforces the conclusion that two distinct species are present.\n    *   This phenomenon is common in peptide chemistry and often points to the presence of isomers.\n\n*   **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   The LC (Liquid Chromatography) data shows two separable peaks, which confirms the presence of two distinct chemical compounds that have different interactions with the chromatography column.\n    *   The \"equal intensities\" of the LC peaks corroborates the 1:1 ratio observed in the NMR spectrum.\n    *   The MS (Mass Spectrometry) data shows that both peaks have the \"same mass spectrum,\" and this mass is consistent with the expected molecule. This is a crucial piece of information. It means the two compounds are isomersâ€”they have the same molecular formula and molecular weight but different three-dimensional arrangements of atoms.\n    *   The fact that the analysis is done at \"elevated temperature\" is a hint often related to conformational isomers (rotamers) which can interconvert. At room temperature, these might show as broad, poorly resolved peaks, but elevated temperature can either speed up interconversion to produce a single average peak (if fast enough) or sharpen the peaks of the individual isomers, leading to better separation as seen here.\n\n*   **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would mean an extra amino acid was added, resulting in a molecule with a higher mass. This is inconsistent with the MS data, which shows the expected mass.\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would have a different chemical structure and, therefore, a different mass. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. By definition, they have the same molecular formula and mass but different physical and chemical properties. This means they will have different NMR spectra (as observed) and can be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC (as observed). This explanation fits all the experimental data. The diastereomers could have formed either through racemization of one of the chiral centers during synthesis or through restricted rotation around an amide bond (creating cis/trans isomers, which are a type of diastereomeric rotamer). In either case, the result is a mixture of diastereomers.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In standard (achiral) conditions, they have identical physical properties, including identical NMR spectra and co-elution in standard LC. To see separate NMR or LC peaks for enantiomers, a chiral environment (like a chiral solvent, chiral shift reagent, or a chiral chromatography column) is required. The problem does not state that any of these were used. Therefore, this explanation is inconsistent with the observation of two distinct peaks in both NMR and LC.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the data (two NMR peaks, two LC peaks, same mass) is that the compound is a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
