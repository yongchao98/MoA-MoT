    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n- It is a benzene ring with three adjacent substituents (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern).\n- C1: ethoxy group (-OEt)\n- C2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n- C3: nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe adjacent arrangement of groups, especially with their specific directing effects, suggests a complex synthesis, likely involving a blocking group to control regiochemistry.\n\n- **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n- **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky.\n- **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nA key challenge is introducing a group meta to the powerful ortho/para-directing ethoxy group. Standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) on a precursor like 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene would not place a nitro group at position 3.\n\n**2. Develop a Plausible Synthetic Strategy (Retrosynthesis)**\n\nSynthesizing 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzenes often requires a multi-step approach with careful control of directing effects. A common strategy is to use a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a removable blocking group.\n\nLet's outline a logical synthesis:\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group can be formed via a Williamson ether synthesis from the corresponding phenol. So, our penultimate target is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. The final reaction would be with a base (like NaOH) and ethyl bromide (EtBr).\n\n*   **Synthesizing 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol:** This molecule still has the tricky 1,2,3-substitution pattern (OH at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C3). A good way to achieve this is as follows:\n    1.  **Start with benzene and add the tert-butyl group:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ gives **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **Block the para position:** The -tBu group is an o,p-director. To force subsequent reactions into the ortho position, we block the sterically accessible para position. Sulfonation with fuming H₂SO₄ yields **p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    3.  **First Nitration:** Now, the -tBu group (o,p) and the -SO₃H group (m) both direct incoming electrophiles to the positions ortho to the tBu group. Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) gives **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  **Introduce the precursor to the hydroxyl group:** The -OH group is best introduced from an -NH₂ group via diazotization. First, we reduce the nitro group just added using Fe/HCl to get **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    5.  **Convert Amine to Phenol:** The amine is converted to a diazonium salt (NaNO₂/HCl) and then hydrolyzed with hot aqueous acid (H₃O⁺/heat) to give **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    6.  **Second Nitration:** Now we nitrate this phenol. The ring has three groups: -OH (strong o,p-director), -tBu (o,p-director), and -SO₃H (m-director).\n        -   -OH at C2 directs to C3, C5.\n        -   -tBu at C4 directs to C3, C5.\n        -   -SO₃H at C1 directs to C3, C5.\n        All three groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to positions C3 and C5. Nitration yields **3-nitro-2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. We now have the desired relative 1,2,3 arrangement of the final substituents.\n    7.  **Remove the Blocking Group:** The sulfonic acid group is removed by heating with dilute sulfuric acid (desulfonation). This yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    8.  **Final Etherification:** As planned, reaction with base and ethyl bromide (NaOH/EtBr) gives the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given Options against the Logical Synthesis**\n\nNow we compare our valid synthesis with the steps provided in the options.\n\n*   **Option A:** Fails because step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline, which does not work. The sequence is also illogical.\n*   **Option B:** Fails because step (iv) attempts to diazotize a molecule without an amino group.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence leads to **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**, which is a different isomer (a 1,3,4-substituted benzene), not the target 1,2,3-isomer.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (Our step 1)\n    ii) `SO3/H2SO4` (Our step 2)\n    iii) `HNO3/H2SO4` (Our step 3)\n    iv) `Fe/HCl` (Our step 4)\n    v) `NaNO2/HCl` (Part of our step 5)\n    vi) `HNO3/H2SO4` (Our step 6 - second nitration)\n    vii) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (Part of our step 5 - hydrolysis)\n    viii) `dilute H2SO4` (Our step 7)\n    ix) `NaOH/EtBr` (Our step 8)\n\nOption C contains all the necessary reactions for the valid synthesis outlined above. However, the order of steps (vi) and (vii) is swapped. In a correct synthesis, the unstable diazonium salt formed in (v) must be immediately converted to the phenol (vii) before the second nitration (vi) is performed. Nitrating the diazonium salt directly is not a standard or viable procedure.\n\nDespite this likely typo in the question's ordering, Option C is the only one that includes the correct set of reagents and transformations required for this challenging synthesis (e.g., it's the only option with two nitration steps and the use of sulfonation as a blocking group followed by desulfonation). In the context of a multiple-choice question, this is the \"best\" and intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
