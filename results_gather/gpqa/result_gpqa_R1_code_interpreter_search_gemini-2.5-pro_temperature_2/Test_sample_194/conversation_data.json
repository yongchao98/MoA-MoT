    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Geometry and Key Relationships\n\nThe problem involves two planets orbiting the same star and sharing the same orbital plane. This means they have the same orbital inclination, `i`, relative to our line of sight.\n\nThe **impact parameter (b)** is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at mid-transit, normalized by the star's radius ($R_s$). It is given by the formula:\n`b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`\nwhere `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\nSince both planets share the same orbital inclination (`i`) and orbit the same star (constant $R_s$), for a given planet, its semi-major axis `a` is directly proportional to its impact parameter `b`. We can write this relationship for our two planets (Planet 1 and Planet 2):\n*   `a_1 / b_1 = R_s / cos(i)`\n*   `a_2 / b_2 = R_s / cos(i)`\n\nTherefore, the ratio of their semi-major axes is equal to the ratio of their impact parameters:\n`a_2 / a_1 = b_2 / b_1`\n\n### 2. Applying Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`):\n`P^2 ∝ a^3`\n\nFor our two planets orbiting the same star, we can write the ratio:\n`(P_2 / P_1)^2 = (a_2 / a_1)^3`\n\n### 3. Combining the Relationships\n\nNow we can substitute the relationship from step 1 into Kepler's Third Law from step 2:\n`(P_2 / P_1)^2 = (b_2 / b_1)^3`\n\nSolving for $P_2$, we get the key formula for this problem:\n`P_2 = P_1 * (b_2 / b_1)^(3/2)`\n\nThis formula allows us to find the orbital period of Planet 2 if we know the parameters of Planet 1 and the impact parameter of Planet 2.\n\n### 4. Determining the Parameters\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   $P_1$ = 3 days\n*   $b_1$ = 0.2\n\nWe need to find the value of $b_2$ that corresponds to the **maximum orbital period** for Planet 2 while still allowing it to transit. A larger period implies a larger semi-major axis `a`, which in turn means a larger impact parameter `b`. So we need to find the maximum possible value for $b_2$.\n\n### 5. Interpreting the Transit Condition for Planet 2\n\nA transit occurs when the planet passes in front of the star. There are a few ways to define the boundary condition for this:\n\n1.  **Partial/Grazing Transit (`b_{max} = 1 + R_{p2}/R_s`):** Any part of the planet's disk grazes the star's disk. This is the absolute physical limit for a transit.\n2.  **Central Transit (`b_{max} = 1`):** The center of the planet's disk passes in front of the star's disk. This is a common and stringent definition for a transiting system in many contexts.\n3.  **Full Ingress (`b_{max} = 1 - R_{p2}/R_s`):** The entire planet's disk is within the star's disk at mid-transit.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum period. Let's test the most common interpretation, which is that a transit implies the planet's center crosses the star's disk (`b ≤ 1`). The maximum value for the impact parameter under this condition is `b_2 = 1`. If we use this interpretation, the radius of Planet 2 ($R_{p2}$) becomes distractor information, which is a common feature in physics and astronomy problems.\n\nLet's assume the intended condition is `b_2 = 1`.\n\n### 6. Calculation\n\nWe will use the derived formula and the determined parameters:\n*   `P_1` = 3 days\n*   `b_1` = 0.2\n*   `b_2` = 1\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Known parameters\nP1 = 3.0  # days\nb1 = 0.2\n\n# Determine the maximum impact parameter for Planet 2.\n# We interpret \"exhibit transit events\" as the standard astronomical definition\n# where the center of the planet crosses the star's disk, meaning b <= 1.\n# To find the maximum period, we use the maximum impact parameter.\nb2_max = 1.0\n\n# Calculate P2 using the derived formula: P2 = P1 * (b2 / b1)^(3/2)\nP2 = P1 * (b2_max / b1)**(1.5)\n\nprint(f\"The maximum orbital period for Planet 2 is: {P2:.2f} days\")\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately **33.54 days**. This matches option C almost exactly. If we were to use the other interpretations for the transit condition, the results would be:\n*   For `b_max = 1 + R_p/R_s` (~1.015), `P_2` ≈ 34.2 days.\n*   For `b_max = 1 - R_p/R_s` (~0.985), `P_2` ≈ 32.7 days.\n\nThe `b_max = 1` assumption provides the closest match to the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Relationship Between Orbital Parameters**\n\n*   **Impact Parameter (b):** The impact parameter is the apparent closest distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star during a transit, measured in units of the star's radius ($R_s$). It's defined by the geometry of the orbit:\n    `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`\n    where `a` is the semi-major axis (the radius of the circular orbit) and `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight (i=90° is an edge-on orbit).\n\n*   **Shared Orbital Plane:** The problem states that both planets share the same orbital plane. This is a crucial piece of information because it means they have the **same orbital inclination, `i`**. They also orbit the same star, so $R_s$ is also the same for both.\n\n*   **Deriving a Ratio:** Since `cos(i)` and $R_s$ are constant for both planets, we can rearrange the impact parameter formula to see the relationship between `a` and `b`:\n    `a / b = R_s / cos(i) = constant`\n    This means the semi-major axis `a` is directly proportional to the impact parameter `b`. We can write this as a ratio for the two planets (Planet 1 and Planet 2):\n    `a₂ / a₁ = b₂ / b₁`\n\n### **2. Apply Kepler's Third Law**\n\n*   Kepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its semi-major axis (`a`). For two planets orbiting the same star, the law is:\n    `(P₂ / P₁)² = (a₂ / a₁)`³\n\n### **3. Combine the Equations**\n\n*   We can now substitute the relationship from step 1 into Kepler's Third Law from step 2:\n    `(P₂ / P₁)² = (b₂ / b₁)`³\n\n*   Solving for the period of the second planet, $P_2$, gives us the main equation we need:\n    **`P₂ = P₁ * (b₂ / b₁)^(3/2)`**\n\n### **4. Determine the Maximum Impact Parameter (b₂)**\n\n*   The question asks for the **maximum** orbital period for Planet 2. A larger period implies a larger semi-major axis (`a₂`), which in turn corresponds to a larger impact parameter (`b₂`). Therefore, we need to find the maximum possible value for `b₂`.\n*   A planet \"exhibits transit and occultation events\" as long as it passes in front of the star. The standard definition of a transit, which gives a clear upper limit, is that the center of the planet must pass over the star's disk.\n*   This means the impact parameter `b` must be between 0 (a central transit) and 1 (a \"grazing\" transit where the planet's center passes exactly over the star's limb). Any value of `b` > 1 means the planet's center misses the star entirely.\n*   Therefore, the maximum impact parameter for a transit to occur is **`b₂,max = 1`**.\n*   *Note: The radii of the star and the planets are not needed for this calculation, as this standard definition of a transit (`b` ≤ 1) makes them distractor information.*\n\n### **5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   Now we plug the known values into our combined equation:\n    *   $P₁ = 3$ days\n    *   $b₁ = 0.2$\n    *   $b₂ = 1$\n\n*   $P₂ = 3 * (1 / 0.2)^(1.5)$\n*   $P₂ = 3 * (5)^(1.5)$\n*   $P₂ = 3 * √(5³) = 3 * √(125)$\n*   $P₂ ≈ 3 * 11.18$\n*   **$P₂ ≈ 33.54$ days**\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
