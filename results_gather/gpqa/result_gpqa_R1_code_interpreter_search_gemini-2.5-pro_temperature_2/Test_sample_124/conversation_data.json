    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical system:** The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. In Cartesian coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, so the potential is $V(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations in the x, y, and z directions.\n\n2.  **Determine the energy eigenvalues:** The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates. The total Hamiltonian is the sum of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians: $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$.\n    The energy eigenvalues of a 1D harmonic oscillator with quantum number $n$ are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n    Therefore, the total energy of the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is the sum of the energies from the three independent dimensions:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Define the principal quantum number and energy levels:** Let's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers. The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, for $N = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots$\n\n4.  **Identify the energy states:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, which corresponds to $N=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=3$.\n        The energy of the third excited state is:\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the degeneracy of the third excited state:** Degeneracy is the number of different quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have the same energy. For the third excited state ($N=3$), we need to find the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that satisfy the equation $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\n    To find these combinations, we can list them systematically:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3)  --> 3 states\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n        (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2)  --> 6 states\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        (1, 1, 1)  --> 1 state\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, this is a combinatorial problem known as \"stars and bars\". The number of non-negative integer solutions to $n_1 + n_2 + \\dots + n_k = N$ is given by the formula $\\binom{N+k-1}{k-1}$. In our case, $N=3$ (energy level) and $k=3$ (dimensions).\n    Degeneracy $g_N = \\binom{N+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{N+2}{2} = \\frac{(N+2)(N+1)}{2}$.\n    For the third excited state, $N=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n\n6.  **Compare the results with the given options:**\n    *   Energy of the third excited state: $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   Degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions): $g_3 = 10$.\n\n    This matches option A.\n\n    Let's check the other options:\n    *   A) (9/2) ħω , 10 --> Matches our calculation.\n    *   B) 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 10 --> Incorrect energy formula. The energy for an oscillator doesn't have this form.\n    *   C) 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 3 --> Incorrect energy formula and incorrect degeneracy.\n    *   D) (9/2) ħω, 3 --> Correct energy but incorrect degeneracy.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
