    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is DoU = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n*   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** These two medium-to-strong bands in the >3300 cm-1 region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a primary amide (-CONH2) would also show two bands in this region.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is typical for an ester, particularly a conjugated ester (an ester attached to an aromatic ring or a double bond). The conjugation slightly lowers the frequency from that of a saturated aliphatic ester (around 1735-1750 cm-1). It is too high for a typical amide (~1680 cm-1).\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   Integration (3H) indicates a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   Multiplicity (t, triplet) indicates it's adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group (n=2 protons, n+1=3 peaks).\n    *   This pattern (-CH2-CH3) is characteristic of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   Integration (2H) indicates a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   Multiplicity (q, quartet) indicates it's adjacent to a methyl (-CH3) group (n=3 protons, n+1=4 peaks).\n    *   The high chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) means this -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen.\n    *   Putting this together with the signal at 1.20 ppm, we have a -O-CH2-CH3 (ethoxy) group. Since we have a carbonyl from the IR, this suggests an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   Integration (2H) and the broad nature of the singlet (bs) are classic signs of amine protons (-NH2). These protons are exchangeable, which often results in a broad signal with no observable coupling. This confirms the primary amine found in the IR.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The ring has two different substituents. The protons next to one substituent are at 7.0 ppm, and the protons next to the other are at 8.0 ppm. Electron-donating groups (like -NH2) shield aromatic protons (shift to lower ppm/upfield), while electron-withdrawing groups (like -COOR) deshield them (shift to higher ppm/downfield).\n    *   Therefore, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the 2 protons ortho to the donating -NH2 group.\n    *   The doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the 2 protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOEt group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has the wrong ester group. It's a phenyl ester of propanoic acid. The NMR would show a -CH2- group of the propionate at ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide (not an ester, inconsistent IR) and is 1,3- (meta) substituted (inconsistent NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine (inconsistent IR with two N-H bands and NMR -NH2 peak). It would also have a very downfield formyl proton (-CHO) signal in the NMR, which is not present.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data: the correct formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the ethyl ester, primary amine, and 1,4-disubstituted aromatic pattern in the NMR.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
