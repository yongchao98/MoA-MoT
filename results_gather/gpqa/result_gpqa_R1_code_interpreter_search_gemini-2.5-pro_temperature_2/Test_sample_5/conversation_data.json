    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum.\n\n**1. Understand the Potential**\n\nThe given potential is:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\nThis potential is expressed in 2D polar coordinates (r, θ). To solve the Schrödinger equation for this potential, it is often advantageous to switch to a coordinate system where the potential becomes separable. Let's convert it to Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\n**2. Convert to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\nx = r * cos(θ)\ny = r * sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nFrom these relationships, we can see that:\nr^2 * cos^2(θ) = (r * cos(θ))^2 = x^2\n\nNow, substitute these into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (x^2)\n\nCombine the terms with x^2 and y^2:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2) * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n**3. Recognize the Separable Potential**\n\nThe potential in Cartesian coordinates is:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\nThis is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be separated into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator equations, one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction.\n\n**4. Solve the 1D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Problems**\n\nThe general energy eigenvalue for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with potential V(z) = 1/2 * k_eff * z^2 is given by:\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω\nwhere the angular frequency ω is given by ω = sqrt(k_eff / m).\n\n**For the x-direction:**\nThe potential is V_x(x) = 2kx^2. We can write this in the standard form V_x(x) = 1/2 * k_eff,x * x^2, which gives k_eff,x = 4k.\nThe angular frequency for the x-motion is:\nω_x = sqrt(k_eff,x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-direction are:\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k / m)) = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n**For the y-direction:**\nThe potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2. This is already in the standard form, so k_eff,y = k.\nThe angular frequency for the y-motion is:\nω_y = sqrt(k_eff,y / m) = sqrt(k / m)\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-direction are:\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n**5. Find the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E of the 2D system is the sum of the energies for the independent x and y motions:\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nNow, factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k / m):\nE = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nwhere n_x = 0, 1, 2, ... and n_y = 0, 1, 2, ... are the quantum numbers.\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m). This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
