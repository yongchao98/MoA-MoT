    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe provided data is:\n*   **7.0 ppm:** 1H, doublet (d), J = 16.0 Hz\n*   **5.5 ppm:** 1H, doublet of quartets (dq)\n*   **2.1 ppm:** 3H, singlet (s)\n*   **1.6 ppm:** 3H, doublet (d)\n\nLet's interpret each signal:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, singlet):** A singlet integrating to 3 hydrogens typically represents a methyl group (CH₃) with no adjacent protons. The chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate ester (-O-C(=O)-CH₃). All four possible compounds contain an acetate group, so this signal is consistent with all of them.\n\n*   **Signals in the Alkene Region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):** These two signals, each for one proton (1H), are in the chemical shift range for vinylic protons (protons attached to a C=C double bond). This confirms a disubstituted double bond of the type R-CH=CH-R'.\n\n*   **The Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. The J-value for coupling between two vinylic protons is stereochemically diagnostic:\n    *   **Trans coupling (protons on opposite sides):** Typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n    *   **Cis coupling (protons on the same side):** Typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    The observed J-value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a **trans** configuration for the double bond. This immediately eliminates the *cis* isomers.\n    *   Ruled out: Cis-propenyl acetate (C) and Cis-butenyl acetate (D).\n\n*   **Distinguishing between Propenyl and Butenyl (The Remaining Signals):** Now we must choose between Trans-propenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate. We need to analyze the alkyl group attached to the double bond.\n\n    *   **Trans-propenyl acetate:** The structure is CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃. The group attached to the double bond is a **methyl group (CH₃)**.\n    *   **Trans-butenyl acetate:** The structure is CH₃CH₂-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃. The group attached to the double bond is an **ethyl group (CH₃CH₂)**.\n\n    Let's look at the remaining signals and their splitting patterns:\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, doublet):** This signal represents a methyl group (3H) that is split into a doublet. According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group must be adjacent to a single proton (-CH-). This matches the CH₃-CH= structure of a propenyl group.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quartets, dq):** This represents a single vinylic proton. It is split into a doublet by the other vinylic proton (the one at 7.0 ppm). It is further split into a quartet by an adjacent methyl group (3 neighboring protons, 3+1=4 lines). This perfectly describes the vinylic proton in the CH₃-CH= fragment.\n\n    If the compound were Trans-butenyl acetate, we would expect to see signals for an ethyl group (CH₃CH₂-), which would consist of a triplet (for the CH₃) and a quartet (for the CH₂). These signals are not present in the given spectrum.\n\n**2. Final Structure Assignment**\n\nLet's assemble the fragments to confirm the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**:\n\n      H(b)      O\n       \\       /\n        C  =  C\n       /       \\\n  (1.6)CH₃      H(a) --- O --- C(=O) --- CH₃(2.1)\n  (5.5)      (7.0)\n\n*   **CH₃ (acetate) at 2.1 ppm:** A singlet, no neighbors. (Correct)\n*   **H(a) at 7.0 ppm:** Vinylic proton next to the oxygen atom (more deshielded). It's coupled only to H(b), so it's a doublet with a large trans-coupling constant. (Correct, d, J=16.0 Hz)\n*   **H(b) at 5.5 ppm:** Vinylic proton. It's coupled to H(a) (making it a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (making it a quartet). The overall pattern is a doublet of quartets. (Correct)\n*   **CH₃ (vinylic) at 1.6 ppm:** This methyl group is adjacent to H(b), which splits it into a doublet. (Correct)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1H NMR data, particularly the trans-coupling constant (J=16.0 Hz) and the splitting patterns indicating a methyl group attached to the double bond, uniquely identifies the compound as Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
