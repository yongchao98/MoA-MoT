    "This question requires identifying which of the given molecules can exhibit optical isomerism. A molecule shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable on the original molecule. This property is usually due to the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are linked by a single bond. The positions ortho to this bond (2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃) at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO₂) at positions 6 and 6'.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The steric hindrance caused by these four bulky ortho substituents prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar, adopting a twisted conformation. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, which is a type of axial chirality. The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Because it is non-planar and its mirror image is non-superimposable, it is chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. It is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** To determine chirality, we look for chiral centers. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group):\n    *   It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n    *   It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n    Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a chiral center and therefore exhibits optical isomerism (existing as R and S enantiomers).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. It's a symmetrical ketone with two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** We look for any source of chirality.\n    *   **Chiral Centers:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The central carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized (only bonded to three atoms).\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the C=O bond. Even if the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane, the molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of this plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on the original.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   **Chiral Centers:** There are no chiral centers. All non-methyl carbons are sp² hybridized.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, it possesses a center of inversion (or a center of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes the molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Molecule 1: Chiral (atropisomerism) -> Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Molecule 2: Chiral (chiral center) -> Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Molecule 3: Achiral (plane of symmetry) -> Does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Molecule 4: Achiral (plane and center of symmetry) -> Does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
