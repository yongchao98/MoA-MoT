    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is a tricyclic, saturated hydrocarbon cage with two bromine atoms at bridgehead positions.\n*   **Reaction:** Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh conditions, suggesting that rearrangement or fragmentation is possible.\n*   **Spectroscopic Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The total integration (2+10+2=14H) matches the number of hydrogens in the starting material, C₁₀H₁₄Br₂. This implies the reaction is a conversion of C₁₀H₁₄Br₂ to a product with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Key Clue for Structure of Product 1:** The subsequent reaction steps provide crucial information. Product 2 (formed from Product 1) undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis (O₃ followed by DMS) cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). This is a definitive indication that Product 2, and therefore Product 1, must contain a C=C double bond.\n*   **Deducing the Structure of Product 1:**\n    *   Product 1 is a ketone (from IR) and has a C=C bond (from ozonolysis step). Its formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4.\n    *   One degree of unsaturation is from the C=O group, and another is from the C=C group. This leaves two degrees of unsaturation, which means the carbon skeleton must be **bicyclic**. The original adamantane cage (tricyclic) must have opened.\n    *   The NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is highly characteristic of vinylic protons of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n    *   A plausible structure that fits all the data is **7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure results from a known fragmentation-rearrangement of the adamantane skeleton under basic conditions. The formula is C₁₀H₁₄O, it's bicyclic, contains a ketone and an exocyclic double bond. It also possesses a plane of symmetry that can explain the relatively simple NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃). This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) in Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   Product 2 is **7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**. It retains the C=C double bond.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is an ozonolysis with reductive workup. It cleaves the C=C bond and converts the carbons into carbonyl groups.\n*   **Cleavage Reaction:** The exocyclic double bond (C=CH₂) in Product 2 is cleaved. The =CH₂ part becomes formaldehyde (CH₂O), which is typically lost during workup. The carbon of the ring that was part of the double bond (C7) becomes a ketone (C=O).\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The resulting molecule retains the alcohol group at C3 and now has a new ketone group at C7.\n    *   Product 3 is **3-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Goal:** Determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding the OH proton, which exchanges with solvent).\n*   **Identifying the Most Deshielded C-H:** In Product 3 (3-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one), there are two main deshielding groups: the ketone (C=O) and the hydroxyl (-OH).\n    *   Protons alpha to a ketone (on C6 and C8) typically have a chemical shift (δ) of about 2.2-2.7 ppm.\n    *   The proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H3) is more deshielded, typically with δ ≈ 3.5-4.5 ppm.\n    *   Therefore, the **proton at the C3 position (H3)** is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n*   **Determining the Coupling Pattern of H3:**\n    *   The H3 proton is on C3. To determine its splitting pattern, we must look at its vicinal neighbors (protons on adjacent carbons). The adjacent carbons are C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are CH₂ groups. So, H3 is coupled to a total of **four** protons.\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton exists in a rigid conformation, usually a distorted chair-chair form. The ring containing C3 (-C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C9-) is chair-like.\n    *   The hydroxyl group at C3 will preferentially occupy the equatorial-like (exo) position to minimize steric strain. This places the H3 proton in the axial-like (endo) position.\n    *   According to the Karplus relationship, the coupling constant (J) depends on the dihedral angle between the coupled protons.\n        *   An axial proton (like H3) has a large coupling (J_ax-ax ≈ 10-13 Hz) to its two axial neighbors (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   An axial proton also has a small coupling (J_ax-eq ≈ 2-5 Hz) to its two equatorial neighbors (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   Although the molecule is not perfectly symmetric (due to C7=O), for the purposes of interpreting the main splitting pattern, we can approximate that the two axial neighbors are magnetically equivalent, and the two equatorial neighbors are also magnetically equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for H3 is split by two protons with a large coupling constant (J_ax), which gives a **triplet**. Each peak of this triplet is then further split by two protons with a small coupling constant (J_eq), which also results in a **triplet**.\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
