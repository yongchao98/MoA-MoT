    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Identify the Principles\n\nThis problem is a classic example of a two-body decay of a stationary particle. To solve it, we must apply the fundamental principles of **conservation of energy** and **conservation of momentum**.\n\n### 2. State the Given Information\n\n*   Decay reaction: `π+ → μ+ + ν`\n*   The initial pion (`π+`) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of the pion, `m_π * c²` = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of the muon, `m_μ * c²` = 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (`ν`) is considered massless, so its rest mass energy `m_ν * c²` = 0.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Momentum\n\n*   **Initial Momentum:** Since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. `p_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final Momentum:** After the decay, the muon (`μ+`) and the neutrino (`ν`) must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Their momentum vectors must sum to zero.\n    *   `p_μ + p_ν = 0`\n    *   This implies that their momentum magnitudes are equal: `|p_μ| = |p_ν|`. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation of Energy\n\n*   **Initial Energy:** The total energy of the stationary pion is just its rest mass energy.\n    *   `E_initial = m_π * c²` = 139.6 MeV\n*   **Final Energy:** The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    *   The total energy of any particle is given by `E_total = KE + m*c²`.\n    *   `E_final = E_μ + E_ν`\n    *   `E_μ` = Total energy of the muon\n    *   `E_ν` = Total energy of the neutrino\n\nEquating the initial and final energies:\n`m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν`\n\n### 5. Combine and Solve\n\nWe have two main equations:\n1.  `|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p`\n2.  `m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν`\n\nLet's express the energies in terms of momentum (`p`) and rest mass (`m`):\n*   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\n*   For the muon: `E_μ² = (p_μ * c)² + (m_μ * c²)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²`\n*   For the massless neutrino: `E_ν² = (p_ν * c)² + (0)² => E_ν = p_ν * c = p*c`.\n\nNow, we can substitute `E_ν = p*c` into the energy conservation equation:\n`m_π * c² = E_μ + p*c  => p*c = m_π * c² - E_μ`\n\nSubstitute this expression for `p*c` into the energy equation for the muon:\n`E_μ² = (m_π * c² - E_μ)² + (m_μ * c²)²`\n\nExpand the squared term:\n`E_μ² = (m_π * c²)² - 2 * (m_π * c²) * E_μ + E_μ² + (m_μ * c²)²`\n\nThe `E_μ²` terms on both sides cancel out. Rearranging the equation to solve for `E_μ` (the total energy of the muon):\n`2 * (m_π * c²) * E_μ = (m_π * c²)² + (m_μ * c²)²`\n`E_μ = [(m_π * c²)² + (m_μ * c²)²] / [2 * (m_π * c²)]`\n\n### 6. Calculate the Numerical Values\n\nLet's plug in the given values to find the total energy of the muon (`E_μ`).\n\n```python\n# Given values in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\nE_mu = (m_pi_c2**2 + m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the neutrino (E_nu) using energy conservation\n# E_nu = E_initial - E_mu\nE_nu = m_pi_c2 - E_mu\n\n# For a massless neutrino, its kinetic energy equals its total energy (KE_nu = E_nu)\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (μ+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (ν): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\nKE of muon (μ+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (ν): 29.78 MeV\n\nRounding the value for the neutrino's kinetic energy to one decimal place gives 29.8 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon (`μ+`): **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino (`ν`): **29.8 MeV**\n\nThese values correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary particle into two products. We can solve this by applying the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\n**1. Given Information:**\n*   Decay reaction: π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n*   The initial particle (pion, π⁺) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of π⁺, `m_π * c²` = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of μ⁺, `m_μ * c²` = 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (ν) is treated as massless, so its rest mass energy `m_ν * c²` = 0.\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\n*   Since the initial pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero.\n*   By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the two product particles, the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν), must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   Let `p` be the magnitude of the momentum for both the muon and the neutrino: `p_μ = p_ν = p`.\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy:**\n*   The total initial energy is the rest mass energy of the stationary pion: `E_initial = m_π * c²`.\n*   The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino: `E_final = E_μ + E_ν`.\n*   Conservation of energy requires `E_initial = E_final`, so:\n    `m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν`\n\n**4. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n*   The total energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) and rest mass (m) by the equation: `E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)²`.\n*   For the muon (μ⁺): `E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μ * c²)²`\n*   For the massless neutrino (ν): `E_ν² = (pc)² + (0)²` which simplifies to `E_ν = pc`.\n\n**5. Solving for the Energies:**\nWe can now combine these equations to solve for the energies of the products.\n\n*   From the energy conservation equation, we have `E_μ = m_π * c² - E_ν`.\n*   Since `E_ν = pc`, we can write `pc = m_π * c² - E_μ`.\n*   Substitute this expression for `pc` into the energy-momentum equation for the muon:\n    `E_μ² = (m_π * c² - E_μ)² + (m_μ * c²)²`\n*   Expand the squared term:\n    `E_μ² = (m_π * c²)² - 2(m_π * c²)E_μ + E_μ² + (m_μ * c²)²`\n*   The `E_μ²` term cancels out on both sides. Rearrange to solve for the total energy of the muon, `E_μ`:\n    `2(m_π * c²)E_μ = (m_π * c²)² + (m_μ * c²)²`\n    `E_μ = [(m_π * c²)² + (m_μ * c²)²] / [2(m_π * c²)]`\n\n**6. Calculating Kinetic Energies:**\nOnce we find the total energies (`E_μ` and `E_ν`), we can find their kinetic energies (`KE`).\n*   Kinetic Energy (KE) is the total energy minus the rest mass energy: `KE = E - m*c²`.\n*   `KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ * c²`\n*   Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is entirely kinetic energy: `KE_ν = E_ν`. We find `E_ν` from the energy conservation equation: `E_ν = m_π * c² - E_μ`.\n\nWe can use Python to perform the calculations accurately.\n```python\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\nE_mu = (m_pi_c2**2 + m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the neutrino (E_nu) from energy conservation\nE_nu = m_pi_c2 - E_mu\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its total energy\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (μ+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (ν): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nThe calculation yields:\n*   Kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ): **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν): **29.78 MeV**, which rounds to **29.8 MeV**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find they match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
