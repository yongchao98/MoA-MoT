    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectroscopic data.**\n    *   **Molecular structure type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached, which can be represented as `C6H4`. A benzene ring has a degree of unsaturation of 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   **FTIR data:** An absorption peak for an ester group (`-COO-`). An ester group contains a carbonyl bond (`C=O`), which adds 1 to the degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR data:** This provides the most detailed information about the structure.\n        *   **Six total signals:** This means there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (`C6H4`). Having two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, like para-substitution, where the four protons exist as two equivalent pairs. Regardless of the pattern, we have **4 aromatic hydrogens**.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** Vinyl hydrogens are attached to a non-aromatic carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C`). This C=C bond adds another 1 to the degree of unsaturation. The splitting patterns are key:\n            *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**, meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton.\n            *   The other is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**, meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and to a group of three equivalent protons (a `-CH3` group, giving the quartet).\n            *   This splitting pattern (d and dq) is characteristic of a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)** where the vinyl protons are adjacent to each other and one of them is also adjacent to a methyl group. This fragment accounts for **2 vinyl hydrogens**.\n        *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n            *   One of these methyl groups is the one identified in the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This methyl group accounts for **3 hydrogens**.\n            *   There is a second, distinct methyl group somewhere else in the molecule. This second methyl group accounts for another **3 hydrogens**.\n        *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that restricts the possible structures. We cannot have any methylene (`-CH2-`) groups.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total number of Hydrogen atoms.**\n    Based on the analysis of the 1H NMR signals, we can sum the number of protons in the molecule:\n    *   Aromatic protons: 4 H\n    *   Vinyl protons: 2 H (from the two vinyl signals)\n    *   Methyl protons: 3 H (from first CH3) + 3 H (from second CH3) = 6 H\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 H**\n\n    This result allows us to eliminate the options that do not have 12 hydrogens.\n    *   A) C12H14O2 (Incorrect H count)\n    *   B) C12H12O2 (Correct H count)\n    *   C) C11H12O2 (Correct H count)\n    *   D) C11H14O2 (Incorrect H count)\n    The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n3.  **Determine the total number of Carbon atoms.**\n    Let's identify and count the carbons from the fragments we've deduced:\n    *   **Aromatic ring:** 6 Carbons (`C6`).\n    *   **Propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`):** This fragment contains 3 Carbons.\n    *   **Second Methyl group (`-CH3`):** This fragment contains 1 Carbon.\n    *   **Ester group (`-COO-`):** This functional group contains a carbonyl carbon (`C=O`). This is a distinct carbon atom not yet counted. This adds 1 Carbon.\n    *   **Total Carbons = 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (second methyl) + 1 (ester carbonyl) = 11 Carbons.**\n\n4.  **Assemble the final molecular formula.**\n    *   Carbon atoms: 11\n    *   Hydrogen atoms: 12\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 2 (from the ester group, `-COO-`)\n    *   The complete chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Final Verification.**\n    This formula, `C11H12O2`, matches option C. We can also verify its degree of unsaturation (DoU):\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Our structural analysis predicted a DoU of 6 (4 from the benzene ring, 1 from the C=C bond, and 1 from the C=O bond). The calculated DoU matches the predicted DoU, confirming our analysis.\n\nBoth the systematic count of atoms based on NMR and the DoU calculation point to the same answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
