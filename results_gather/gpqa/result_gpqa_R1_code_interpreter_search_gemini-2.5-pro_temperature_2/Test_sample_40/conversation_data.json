    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:** We need to use the principles of special relativity, which involves different inertial frames of reference.\n    *   **Frame S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the observer's frame of reference, which is considered stationary. In this frame, the glass is moving.\n    *   **Frame S' (Glass's Frame):** This is the frame of reference moving along with the piece of glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **v:** The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S). The problem states this is `v`, and it's in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   **u'**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (frame S'). This is the speed of light within the medium itself, as measured by an observer at rest with respect to the medium.\n    *   **u**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory (frame S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n3.  **Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Frame (u'):**\n    *   The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`) when the medium is at rest.\n    *   The formula is `n = c / u'`.\n    *   The problem specifies that we should take the speed of light in a vacuum as `c = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, `u' = c / n = 1 / n`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    *   According to Einstein's special theory of relativity, when two velocities are in the same direction, they do not simply add up. Instead, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n    *   The formula is: `u = (v + u') / (1 + v*u' / c^2)`\n    *   This formula gives the velocity `u` of an object in frame S, given its velocity `u'` in frame S' and the velocity `v` of frame S' relative to S.\n\n5.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    *   We have `v = v`, `u' = 1/n`, and `c = 1`.\n    *   Substituting these into the formula:\n        `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v*(1/n) / 1^2)`\n        `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   To eliminate the fractions within the numerator and the denominator, we can multiply the entire expression by `n/n`.\n        `u = [n * (v + 1/n)] / [n * (1 + v/n)]`\n    *   Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n        `u = (n*v + n*(1/n)) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n        `u = (n*v + 1) / (n + v)`\n    *   Rearranging the terms in the numerator to match the options:\n        `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   The calculated speed `u` is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    *   This result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
