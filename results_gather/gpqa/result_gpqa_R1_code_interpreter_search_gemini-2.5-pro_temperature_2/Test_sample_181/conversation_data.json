    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Mott-Gurney Equation and its context.**\n    The given equation, $J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$, describes the current-voltage relationship in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The key feature is that the current density ($J$) is proportional to the square of the voltage ($V^2$). This relationship arises under specific physical conditions in a semiconductor or insulator. Let's break down the fundamental assumptions required to derive this equation.\n\n*   **Step 2: Deconstruct the physical assumptions for the Mott-Gurney Law.**\n    1.  **Carrier Type:** The model assumes that charge is transported by only one type of carrier (either electrons or holes). The contribution from the other carrier type is considered negligible. This means it must be a **single-carrier device** (unipolar injection).\n    2.  **Traps:** The derivation in its simplest form, leading to the $V^2$ dependence, assumes that there are no electronic states (traps) in the bandgap that can immobilize the injected carriers. Therefore, the material is considered **trap-free**. If traps were present, the current would follow a different, more complex voltage dependence.\n    3.  **Carrier Injection:** For a space-charge-limited current to exist, the contacts must be able to inject more carriers into the device than the material's bulk can transport. This requires at least one injecting contact, known as an Ohmic contact. An Ohmic contact, in this context, is one that poses **no (or a negligible) energy barrier to carrier injection**. A Schottky contact, by contrast, is a rectifying contact with a significant energy barrier and would limit the current injection, preventing the SCLC condition.\n    4.  **Transport Mechanism:** The model assumes that the injected carriers move under the influence of the applied electric field. This is called **drift current**. The current arising from the concentration gradient of carriers, known as **diffusion current**, is assumed to be **negligible** in comparison to the drift current. This assumption is valid as long as the device is not too thin and the voltage is not too low.\n    5.  **Intrinsic Carriers:** The model assumes the concentration of injected carriers is far greater than the concentration of intrinsic (thermally generated) carriers. This is why the law is often applied to insulators or wide-bandgap semiconductors.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate each option against the derived assumptions.**\n    *   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n        *   This statement is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law describes a drift-dominated current. The drift current is the primary mechanism, not negligible.\n\n    *   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   This statement is incorrect because a Schottky contact creates an injection barrier, which is contrary to the requirement of a freely injecting (Ohmic) contact needed for SCLC.\n\n    *   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   This statement aligns perfectly with our analysis.\n        *   `trap-free`: Correct.\n        *   `single-carrier device`: Correct.\n        *   `no carrier injection barrier`: Correct, this is the functional description of the required Ohmic contact.\n        *   `negligible diffusion current`: Correct.\n\n    *   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   This statement is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law is derived for a single-carrier (unipolar) device. The presence of two mobile carrier types would introduce recombination and change the underlying physics and the resulting equation.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the correct option.**\n    Based on the analysis, option C provides the most accurate and complete set of conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
