    "This problem requires calculating the molar fraction of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or [Co(SCN)2], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    The species containing cobalt are the free Co(II) ion and the complexes it forms with thiocyanate (SCN-). Let L represent the ligand SCN-. The species are:\n    *   Co^2+ (free ion)\n    *   [Co(L)]+\n    *   [Co(L)2]\n    *   [Co(L)3]-\n    *   [Co(L)4]2-\n\n2.  **Formulate the expressions for concentrations:**\n    The formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β):\n    *   β1 = [[Co(L)]+] / ([Co^2+] * [L]) = 9\n    *   β2 = [[Co(L)2]] / ([Co^2+] * [L]^2) = 40\n    *   β3 = [[Co(L)3]-] / ([Co^2+] * [L]^3) = 63\n    *   β4 = [[Co(L)4]2-] / ([Co^2+] * [L]^4) = 16\n\n    We can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration, [Co^2+], and the free ligand concentration, [L]:\n    *   [[Co(L)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [L]\n    *   [[Co(L)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [L]^2\n    *   [[Co(L)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [L]^3\n    *   [[Co(L)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [L]^4\n\n3.  **Define the total cobalt concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(L)]+] + [[Co(L)2]] + [[Co(L)3]-] + [[Co(L)4]2-]\n\n    Substituting the expressions from step 2:\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][L] + β2[Co^2+][L]^2 + β3[Co^2+][L]^3 + β4[Co^2+][L]^4\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4)\n\n4.  **Calculate the fraction of the [Co(L)2] complex:**\n    The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(L)2]. The fraction (α2) of this complex is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    α2 = [[Co(L)2]] / c(Co)\n    α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [L]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4))\n\n    The [Co^2+] term cancels out, leaving:\n    α2 = (β2 * [L]^2) / (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4)\n\n5.  **Estimate the free ligand concentration [L]:**\n    The total thiocyanate concentration is given as 0.1 M, and the total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M. Since the ligand concentration is 10 times greater than the metal ion concentration, we can make the common and reasonable approximation that the concentration of the free ligand [L] is nearly equal to its total initial concentration.\n    So, we'll use [L] = [SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M.\n\n6.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    Now, we plug the given values into the formula for α2:\n    *   [L] = 0.1 M\n    *   β1 = 9\n    *   β2 = 40\n    *   β3 = 63\n    *   β4 = 16\n\n    Calculate the terms in the denominator first:\n    *   1\n    *   β1 * [L] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   β2 * [L]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   β3 * [L]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   β4 * [L]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n    The denominator (the sum of all terms) is:\n    Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n    The numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(L)2] complex:\n    Numerator = β2 * [L]^2 = 0.4\n\n    Now, calculate the fraction α2:\n    α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    To get the percentage, multiply by 100:\n    Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.92%\n\nThis value is very close to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
