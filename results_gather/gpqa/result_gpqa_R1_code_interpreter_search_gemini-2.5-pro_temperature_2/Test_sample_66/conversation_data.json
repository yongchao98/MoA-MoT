    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket `|l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    *   `l1 = 1`: Orbital angular momentum quantum number for electron 1 (since it's in a p orbital).\n    *   `l2 = 1`: Orbital angular momentum quantum number for electron 2 (also in a p orbital).\n    *   `l = 2`: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   `m = -1`: The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number. The eigenvalue of the total `Lz` operator is `m*hbar = -1*hbar`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Final (Measured) State:**\n    We want to find the joint probability of a measurement of `L1z` and `L2z` yielding specific eigenvalues.\n    *   The eigenvalue of `L1z` is given as `-hbar`. This means the magnetic quantum number for electron 1 is `m1 = -1`.\n    *   The eigenvalue of `L2z` is given as `-hbar`. This means the magnetic quantum number for electron 2 is `m2 = -1`.\n    This corresponds to the uncoupled state described by the ket `|l1, m1> |l2, m2> = |1, -1> |1, -1>`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle of Angular Momentum Addition:**\n    A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. The corresponding quantum numbers must satisfy the same relationship:\n    `Lz = L1z + L2z`\n    This implies a strict selection rule for the magnetic quantum numbers:\n    `m = m1 + m2`\n\n4.  **Check the Selection Rule:**\n    Let's check if this rule is satisfied for the transition from the initial state to the final measured state.\n    *   From the initial coupled state `|2, -1>`, the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n    *   From the final measured state `|1, -1>|1, -1>`, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is `m1 + m2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state `|l1, m1; l2, m2>` when it is in the coupled state `|l, m>` is given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    `P(m1, m2) = |<l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>|^2`\n\n    However, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients `<l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>` are non-zero only if the selection rule `m = m1 + m2` is met.\n    In our case, `m = -1` and `m1 + m2 = -2`. Since `-1 â‰  -2`, the selection rule is violated.\n\n    Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this specific transition is zero:\n    `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0`\n\n    The probability is the square of this coefficient:\n    `P(m1=-1, m2=-1) = |0|^2 = 0`\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIt is impossible to measure `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1` when the system is in a state where the total `m` is `-1`, because the z-component of angular momentum must be conserved. The sum of the measured individual z-components (`-2*hbar`) must equal the total z-component of the system (`-1*hbar`), which is not the case. Thus, the probability of this specific measurement outcome is zero.\n\n<<<B>>>"
