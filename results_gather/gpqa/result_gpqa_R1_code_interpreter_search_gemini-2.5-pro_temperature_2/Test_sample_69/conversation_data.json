    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3: The Hydrolysis Reaction**\n    *   C + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)\n    *   This is the most chemically specific clue. The formation of a strong acid and a weak acid from the hydrolysis of a single substance (the 'B' part of C) strongly suggests the hydrolysis of an interhalogen compound where the halogens have different electronegativities.\n    *   Let's consider the hydrolysis of chlorine monofluoride (ClF). The chlorine atom is less electronegative than the fluorine atom.\n        ClF + H₂O → HCl + HFO\n    *   Here, HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid (F), and HFO (hypofluorous acid) is a weak acid (G). This is a perfect match.\n    *   This leads to the identification:\n        *   **B = ClF** (chlorine monofluoride), which is a gas at room temperature (b.p. -100 °C).\n        *   **F = HCl**\n        *   **G = HFO**\n    *   The clue also states that solid A is reformed. This means C is composed of A and components of B (Cl and F), and upon hydrolysis, A is released while the Cl and F parts react with water. This suggests C is likely an adduct or a complex, like A·(ClF)₈.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 4: The Solvent Formation**\n    *   D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   We have identified B = ClF. So, D(g) + ClF(g) → H(solvent).\n    *   We need to find a gas D that reacts with ClF in a 1:1 ratio to produce a liquid solvent H. Fluorine gas (F₂) fits this description perfectly.\n        F₂ + ClF → ClF₃\n    *   Chlorine trifluoride (ClF₃) is a liquid at room temperature (b.p. 12 °C) and is used as a powerful fluorinating agent and solvent.\n    *   This identifies:\n        *   **D = F₂** (fluorine gas)\n        *   **H = ClF₃** (chlorine trifluoride)\n\n3.  **Analyze Clues 1 & 2 to Identify A, C, and E**\n    *   Clue 1: A(s) + 8 ClF(g) → C (bright red product)\n    *   Clue 2: C + 2 F₂(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n    *   From Clue 3, we know C must contain A, and upon hydrolysis, A is regenerated. This suggests that the Xe(0) element is likely A. Although Xenon is a gas at STP, it is a solid below -111.8 °C. Riddles can sometimes take liberties with standard conditions, or refer to the element itself. Let's hypothesize A = Xe.\n    *   So, Xe(s) + 8 ClF(g) → C (red). This reaction would form a complex or adduct, which we can denote as **C = Xe(ClF)₈**. While this specific compound is not well-known, its existence as an unstable, colored intermediate is plausible within the context of a puzzle. The hydrolysis of this adduct (C) would regenerate Xenon (A) and produce HCl (F) and HFO (G), as established in step 1.\n    *   Now, let's test Clue 2 with our identified species.\n        C + 2D → E\n        Xe(ClF)₈ + 2F₂ → E\n    *   This reaction involves the fluorination of the central Xenon atom by fluorine gas, likely displacing the ClF ligands. Let's try to form a stable xenon fluoride as product E. The most common xenon fluorides are XeF₂, XeF₄, and XeF₆.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that E = XeF₄, a well-known hazardous substance (it hydrolyzes to form explosive XeO₃).\n        Xe(ClF)₈ + 2F₂ → XeF₄ + 8ClF\n    *   Let's check the atom balance for this reaction:\n        *   Reactants: 1 Xe, 8 Cl, (8 F from ClF + 4 F from 2F₂) = 14 F.\n        *   Products: 1 Xe, 4 F (in XeF₄) + 8 Cl + (8 F from ClF) = 1 Xe, 8 Cl, 12 F.\n    *   The equation does not balance. Let me re-evaluate the reaction. Perhaps the F₂ helps form E, and the ClF ligands are simply released. Let's reconsider the core reaction on the central atom: A + 2D -> E.\n        Xe + 2F₂ -> XeF₄. This reaction has the correct C+2D->E stoichiometry if we consider C=Xe, which we already identified with A. The surrounding ClF ligands in C must be spectators that are released.\n        Let's rewrite reaction 2 as: The Xe core of C reacts with 2F₂, so that the overall reaction is Xe(ClF)₈ + 2F₂ → XeF₄ + 8ClF. Let me re-check the balance.\n        Reactants: 1 Xe, 8 Cl, 8 F from ClF, 4 F from 2F₂ --> **1 Xe, 8 Cl, 12 F**\n        Products: 1 Xe, 4 F from XeF₄, 8 Cl, 8 F from 8ClF --> **1 Xe, 8 Cl, 12 F**\n    *   My previous balancing check was incorrect. The equation **does balance perfectly!** This strongly supports the identification of E = XeF₄.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n    *   We have identified E as Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄).\n    *   According to VSEPR theory, Xe has 8 valence electrons. It forms 4 single bonds with F and has 2 lone pairs ((8-4)/2 = 2).\n    *   A central atom with 4 bonding pairs and 2 lone pairs (AX₄E₂) adopts a square planar molecular geometry to minimize repulsion between the lone pairs, which are placed in the axial positions.\n    *   A square planar molecule has a principal C₄ axis, four perpendicular C₂ axes, a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ), two dihedral mirror planes (σd), and two vertical mirror planes (σv). It also has a center of inversion (i).\n    *   The point group for this high degree of symmetry is **D4h**.\n\n**Summary of Identities:**\n*   A = Xe (Xenon)\n*   B = ClF (Chlorine monofluoride)\n*   C = Xe(ClF)₈ (A postulated bright red complex)\n*   D = F₂ (Fluorine)\n*   E = XeF₄ (Xenon tetrafluoride)\n*   F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n*   G = HFO (Hypofluorous acid)\n*   H = ClF₃ (Chlorine trifluoride)\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (XeF₄) is D4h.\n\n<<<D>>>"
