    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle relates the uncertainty in a quantum state's energy ($\\Delta E$) to its lifetime ($\\Delta t$ or $\\tau$). The relationship is given by:\n    $\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. For practical calculations involving the energy width (or natural linewidth) of a state, this is often approximated as:\n    $\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau}$\n\n*   **Energy Uncertainty of Each State:** We need to calculate the inherent energy uncertainty for each quantum state based on its lifetime.\n    *   State 1: Lifetime $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ sec\n    *   State 2: Lifetime $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ sec\n    *   The value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s is $\\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s.\n\n    The energy uncertainty (width) for State 1 is:\n    $\\Delta E_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n\n    The energy uncertainty (width) for State 2 is:\n    $\\Delta E_2 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV\n\n*   **Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their energies, $|E_1 - E_2|$, must be significantly larger than their combined energy uncertainties. A common criterion (analogous to the Rayleigh criterion) is that the energy separation must be at least equal to the sum of the individual energy widths (full width at half maximum).\n    $|E_1 - E_2| \\ge \\Delta E_{total} = \\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2$\n\n*   **Calculate Minimum Energy Difference:**\n    $\\Delta E_{total} = (6.582 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}) + (6.582 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ eV})$\n    $\\Delta E_{total} \\approx (6.58 \\times 10^{-7}) + (0.658 \\times 10^{-7}) \\text{ eV} = 7.238 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n\n    Therefore, to clearly distinguish the two levels, their energy difference $|E_1 - E_2|$ must be greater than approximately $7.2 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n*   **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) $10^{-11}$ eV  (Much smaller than the required minimum)\n    *   B) $10^{-9}$ eV  (Much smaller than the required minimum)\n    *   C) $10^{-4}$ eV  (Much larger than the required minimum)\n    *   D) $10^{-8}$ eV  (Smaller than the required minimum)\n\n    Only option C, $10^{-4}$ eV, provides an energy separation that is large enough to clearly resolve the two states, as it is several orders of magnitude greater than the combined energy uncertainty.\n\n**2. Python Code for Verification**\nHere is a Python script to perform the calculation precisely.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV.s\nhbar = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state using the formula delta_E = hbar / tau\ndelta_E1 = hbar / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar / tau2\n\n# The condition for the levels to be resolved is that their energy difference\n# must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths.\nmin_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (delta_E1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (delta_E2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum energy difference required for resolution: {min_energy_difference:.4e} eV\")\n\n# Given options\noptions = {\n    'A': 1e-11,\n    'B': 1e-9,\n    'C': 1e-4,\n    'D': 1e-8\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > min_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is large enough for resolution.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT large enough for resolution.\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nEnergy width of state 1 (delta_E1): 6.5821e-07 eV\nEnergy width of state 2 (delta_E2): 6.5821e-08 eV\nMinimum energy difference required for resolution: 7.2403e-07 eV\n\nComparing with options:\nOption A (1.0e-11 eV) is NOT large enough for resolution.\nOption B (1.0e-09 eV) is NOT large enough for resolution.\nOption C (1.0e-04 eV) is large enough for resolution.\nOption D (1.0e-08 eV) is NOT large enough for resolution.\n```\n\n**3. Final Answer**\n\nThe calculation confirms that the required energy difference must be greater than approximately $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. Out of the given choices, only $10^{-4}$ eV satisfies this condition.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem is solved using the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that for a quantum state with a lifetime $\\tau$, there is an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy level, given by $\\Delta E \\approx \\hbar/\\tau$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s).\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:**\n    *   For the first state, with a lifetime $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s, the energy uncertainty is:\n        $\\Delta E_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}$\n    *   For the second state, with a lifetime $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s, the energy uncertainty is:\n        $\\Delta E_2 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ eV}$\n\n2.  **Determine the condition for resolution:**\n    *   To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference between their energies, $|E_1 - E_2|$, must be significantly greater than the energy widths of the levels. A common criterion is that the energy difference should be at least as large as the sum of the individual energy widths.\n    *   Minimum required energy difference = $\\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2 \\approx (6.58 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}) + (6.58 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ eV}) = 7.238 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n3.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   We need an energy difference greater than approximately $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   A) $10^{-11}$ eV is much smaller.\n    *   B) $10^{-9}$ eV is smaller.\n    *   C) $10^{-4}$ eV is much larger.\n    *   D) $10^{-8}$ eV is smaller.\n\nOnly option C provides an energy separation that is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<C>>>"
