    "*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for \"vinyl-hydrogens\" confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]+.\n        *   Mass of C = 12\n        *   Mass of O x 2 = 16 x 2 = 32\n        *   Mass of H = 1\n        *   Total mass = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n\n*   **Synthesizing the Information:**\n    *   The combined spectral data indicates that the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This means it must contain both a C=C double bond and a -COOH group.\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen.\n    *   We are left with C (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2).\n\n*   **Calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The DoU tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   Our structure requires at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=C bond and one for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **For C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 is not enough to have both a C=C and a C=O double bond. This would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid).\n    *   **For D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 is exactly what is needed for one C=C double bond and one C=O double bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The chemical formula C6H10O2 is the only one that satisfies all the experimental evidence: it has two oxygens for the carboxylic acid, and it has a degree of unsaturation of 2, allowing for both the alkene C=C bond and the carboxylic acid C=O bond.\n\n<<<D>>>"
