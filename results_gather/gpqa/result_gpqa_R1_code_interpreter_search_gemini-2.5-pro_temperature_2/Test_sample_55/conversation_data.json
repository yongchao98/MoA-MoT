    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the allowed transitions based on electric dipole selection rules.**\n    The electric dipole transition selection rules for a hydrogen atom are:\n    *   $\\Delta n$: no restriction (principal quantum number can change by any integer value, though decay implies $n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ (orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by 1).\n    *   $\\Delta m_l = 0, \\pm 1$ (magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or 1).\n\n2.  **Determine the intermediate state for the first transition.**\n    The initial state is $|n, l, m_l\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$. This is the 3s state.\n    The decay is a two-step process to reach the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$. Let's denote the intermediate state as $|n', l', m'_l\\rangle$.\n\n    For the first transition, $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'_l\\rangle$:\n    *   Since it is a decay, $n' < 3$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m_l = 0, \\pm 1$: $m'_l - m_l = m'_l - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'_l$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n\n    From the options provided, the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is allowed. Thus, the intermediate states must be in the $2p$ subshell, i.e., of the form $|2, 1, m'_l\\rangle$ where $m'_l \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the second transition.**\n    The second transition is from the intermediate state $|2, 1, m'_l\\rangle$ to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n    *   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$. Allowed.\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. Allowed.\n    *   $\\Delta m_l = 0 - m'_l$. Since $m'_l \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, $\\Delta m_l$ can be $0, 1, -1$, which satisfies the selection rule $\\Delta m_l = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n    Therefore, all three possible routes through the intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are valid according to the selection rules.\n    *   Route A: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route B: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route C: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the transition probabilities (branching ratios).**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This is determined by the branching ratios of the decay steps.\n    *   **First step**: The atom decays from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to one of the three states in the $|2,1,m'_l\\rangle$ manifold.\n    *   **Second step**: The atom in a state $|2,1,m'_l\\rangle$ decays. The only allowed dipole transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (as $n$ must decrease). Therefore, the branching ratio for the second step is 1, regardless of the intermediate state $m'_l$.\n\n    The overall probability of a given cascade route is thus determined entirely by the branching ratio of the first step. The branching ratio for the transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'_l\\rangle$ is given by:\n    $BR(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m'_l) = \\frac{A(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m'_l)}{\\sum_{m''_l=-1,0,1} A(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m''_l)}$\n    where $A(i \\to f)$ is the Einstein A coefficient (transition rate) for spontaneous emission. The rate is proportional to the square of the electric dipole matrix element:\n    $A(i \\to f) \\propto |\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    We need to compare the transition rates from the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the three possible final states $|f\\rangle = |2,1,m'_l\\rangle$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (its angular wave function $Y_{00}$ is a constant).\n    *   The final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate in the absence of external fields.\n\n    Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transition probabilities to the three degenerate $m'_l$ states must be equal.\n\n    Let's confirm this using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element can be written as:\n    $\\langle n' l' m'_l | T^k_q | n l m_l \\rangle = \\langle n' l' || T^k || n l \\rangle \\cdot C^{l' m'_l}_{l m_l; k q}$\n    Here, $|i\\rangle=|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m_l=0$.\n    The final state is $|f\\rangle=|2,1,m'_l\\rangle$, so $n'=2, l'=1$.\n    The electric dipole operator is a rank-1 tensor ($k=1$), and the transition to a specific $m'_l$ is driven by the operator component $T^1_{q}$ with $q = m'_l - m_l = m'_l$.\n    The rate is proportional to $|\\langle 2,1,m'_l | T^1_{m'_l} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n    The squared Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $(C^{1 m'_l}_{0 0; 1 m'_l})^2$ determines the relative angular probability.\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $C^{j m}_{j_1 m_1; j_2 m_2}$ for coupling $l_1=0$ with $l_2=1$ to get $l=1$ is always 1 (i.e., $|C^{1 m'_l}_{0 0; 1 m'_l}|=1$ for $m'_l=-1, 0, 1$).\n    The radial part $\\langle 2,1 || r || 3,0 \\rangle$ is the same for all three transitions.\n\n    Since the angular part is the same for all three values of $m'_l$, the transition rates are equal:\n    $A(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,-1) = A(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0) = A(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,1)$.\n\n    Let's call this rate $A_0$. The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of these three rates: $\\Gamma_{total} = A_0 + A_0 + A_0 = 3A_0$.\n    The branching ratio for the transition to any specific state, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n    $BR(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0) = \\frac{A_0}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{A_0}{3A_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    The probability for any of the three possible routes is the product of the branching ratios of the steps.\n    $P(\\text{route via } m'_l) = BR(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m'_l) \\times BR(2,1,m'_l \\to 1,0,0) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Now, let's examine the options:\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability)\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Correct route and probability)\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability)\n    *   D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and a probability of $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Incomplete description and incorrect probability)\n\n    Option B provides a valid decay route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<B>>>"
