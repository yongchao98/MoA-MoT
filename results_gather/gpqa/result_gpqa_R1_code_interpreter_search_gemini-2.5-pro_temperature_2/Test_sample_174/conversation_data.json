    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Physical System and Radiation Type\n\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. When a localized, non-spherically symmetric charge distribution oscillates, it radiates electromagnetic waves. The lowest order and typically most dominant form of radiation is electric dipole radiation.\n\nLet's model the system as an oscillating electric dipole. The \"spheroid in shape\" with the \"symmetry axis along z-axis\" description suggests that the oscillation happens along this symmetry axis. This creates an oscillating electric dipole moment **p**(t) aligned with the z-axis: `p(t) = p₀ cos(ωt) ẑ`.\n\n### 2. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the radiated power per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) in the radiation zone (far field) is given by the formula:\n`dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴) / (32 π² c) * sin²(θ)`\nwhere:\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that the radiated power is proportional to `sin²(θ)`.\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Fraction of Maximum Power\n\nThe problem states that the maximum radiated power per unit solid angle is `A`. We need to find the angle `θ` where the power is maximum. The function `sin²(θ)` is maximum when `sin(θ) = ±1`, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (or π/2 radians).\n\n*   **Maximum Power (A):**\n    `A = (dP/dΩ)_max ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`\n\nNow, we need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n\n*   **Power at 30°:**\n    `(dP/dΩ)_30° ∝ sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nTherefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `30°` is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the power at `90°`.\n`Fraction = (dP/dΩ)_30° / (dP/dΩ)_max = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`\n\nTo be certain about the value of `sin²(30°)`, we can use a short python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Calculate sin^2(30 degrees)\ntheta_deg = 30\ntheta_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\nfraction = np.sin(theta_rad)**2\nprint(fraction)\n```\n\nThe code will output `0.25`, which confirms our calculation of `1/4`.\n\n### 4. Determine the Wavelength Dependence\n\nThe radiated power per unit solid angle `f(λ, θ)` also depends on the wavelength `λ`. From the dipole radiation formula:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is:\n`ω = 2πf_freq = 2π(c/λ)`\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for power:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nSo, the power function `f` has a dependence on `λ` of the form `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nCombining our findings:\n*   The fraction of maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n*   The form of the wavelength dependence is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThese two results match option B.\n\n*(Note: One might consider electric quadrupole radiation as an alternative, which has `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²θcos²θ` and `P ∝ λ⁻⁶`. This would lead to a fraction of 3/4. However, dipole radiation is the lowest-order, dominant form of radiation from a simple oscillating charge distribution, and is the most reasonable physical model unless the dipole moment is explicitly stated to be zero.)*\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
    "The physical system described is an oscillating charge distribution with a defined symmetry axis (z-axis). Such a system can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, which is the lowest and most dominant order of radiation unless its moment is zero. The problem does not provide any information to suggest the dipole moment vanishes, so we proceed with the electric dipole radiation model.\n\n### Step 1: Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) in the far-field (radiation zone) is given by the Larmor formula:\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\nwhere `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the dipole moment, frequency, and fundamental constants, but not on the angle `θ`.\n\nThe radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs when `θ = 90°` (or π/2 radians).\n\nThe problem states that this maximum radiated power per unit solid angle is `A`. So,\n`A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * (1)² = C`\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Fraction of Maximum Power\n\nWe need to find the fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the power radiated at this angle:\n`(dP/dΩ) at 30° = C * sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nTherefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nSo, `(dP/dΩ) at 30° = C * (1/4) = A / 4`.\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the maximum power `A`:\n`Fraction = [(dP/dΩ) at 30°] / A = (A / 4) / A = 1/4`\n\n### Step 3: Wavelength Dependence\n\nThe radiated power `f(λ, θ)` also depends on the wavelength `λ`. The full expression for the radiated power per unit solid angle is:\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32 π² ε₀ c³) * sin²(θ)`\nwhere `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment, `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation, `c` is the speed of light, and `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n\nFrom this formula, we see the dependence on frequency:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`. Substituting this into the proportionality:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThus, a possible form for the function `f`'s dependence on wavelength is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining our results:\n1.  The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n2.  A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThese results correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
