    "This problem can be solved using the method of images, a technique in electrostatics that simplifies problems involving charges and conductors.\n\n**1. The Method of Images**\n\nThe electric field outside a grounded conducting sphere due to an external charge `q` is identical to the field produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere, if we remove the sphere.\n\n*   The grounded sphere has a potential of V = 0.\n*   The original charge is `q` at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere.\n*   The conducting sphere of radius `R` can be replaced by an image charge `q'` at a distance `b` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n*   For the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) to be zero, the image charge and its position must be:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position `d`, in the presence of the grounded sphere. There are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n\nThe force on the charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere is the same as the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. As we bring the charge `q` from infinity towards the sphere, its distance `r` from the center changes, and so do the image charge `q'(r)` and its position `b(r)`.\n\n*   At any distance `r` from the center, the force on `q` is:\n    `F(r) = k * q * q' / (r - b)^2`\n    where `q' = -qR/r` and `b = R^2/r`.\n    `F(r) = k * q * (-qR/r) / (r - R^2/r)^2 = -k * q^2 * (R/r) / ((r^2 - R^2)/r)^2 = - (k * q^2 * R * r) / (r^2 - R^2)^2`\n    This is an attractive force.\n\n*   The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge from infinity to distance `d`, which is the negative of the work done by the electric field:\n    `U = W_ext = - ∫[∞ to d] F(r) dr`\n    `U = - ∫[∞ to d] [- (k * q^2 * R * r) / (r^2 - R^2)^2] dr = k * q^2 * R * ∫[∞ to d] r / (r^2 - R^2)^2 dr`\n\n*   To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = r^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2r dr`.\n    `∫ r / (r^2 - R^2)^2 dr = (1/2) ∫ u^-2 du = -1 / (2u) = -1 / (2(r^2 - R^2))`\n\n*   Now, we evaluate the definite integral:\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(r^2 - R^2)) ]` from `r = ∞` to `r = d`.\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))) ]`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0 ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential**\n\nThe potential energy `U` of a system of a point charge `q` and a set of conductors is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_other`, where `V_other` is the potential at the location of `q` created by all other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). The contributions from the conductors themselves are zero if they are grounded (V=0).\n\n*   The potential at the position of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced charges is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that position.\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n*   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d) = - (k*q*R/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   Now calculate the energy `U`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [ - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (has R²)\nB) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct**\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (missing 1/2 and R, has d)\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect (denominator and numerator are wrong)\n\nThe correct expression for the net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
