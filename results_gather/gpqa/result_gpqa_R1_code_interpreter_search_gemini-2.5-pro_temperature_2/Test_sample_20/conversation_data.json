    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is an equilibrium between two isomers, called tautomers, which differ in the position of an atom (usually hydrogen) and a double bond. The most common type is **keto-enol tautomerism**, where a molecule containing a carbonyl group (keto form) is in equilibrium with a form containing a hydroxyl group and a C=C double bond (enol form).\n*   A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to an alpha-carbon, which is the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl carbon. The alpha-carbon must be sp³-hybridized.\n\nLet's examine the two compounds:\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   Its structure consists of a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups (C=O) at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) between positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   Let's identify the alpha-carbons. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group at C1 are C2 and C6. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group at C4 are C3 and C5.\n    *   All these alpha-carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) are part of the C=C double bonds in the ring. They are sp²-hybridized, not sp³-hybridized.\n    *   Since there are no hydrogen atoms on any sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, it **does not show tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   Let's identify the alpha-carbons. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. For example, the carbon at position 2 is alpha to both the C1 and C3 carbonyls.\n    *   These alpha-carbons (C2, C4, C6) are sp³-hybridized and each carries two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Because it has these alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism. In fact, it readily tautomerizes to its extremely stable enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic compound.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does show tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs when a molecule is **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Such molecules are capable of rotating the plane of polarized light.\n*   A common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). A chiral center is typically a carbon atom that is bonded to four different groups.\n\nLet's examine the two compounds:\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-C(=O)O-CH₃.\n    *   Let's analyze the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.\n    *   As a chiral molecule, it exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and **will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    *   Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule has a C=C double bond, so no carbon has four single bonds. More importantly, we check for overall molecular symmetry.\n    *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\nCombining our findings:\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
