    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the HPLC analyses.\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene.\n2.  **Step 1 of Reaction:** Treatment with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA). This is an epoxidation reaction. The addition of the oxygen atom is a *syn-addition*.\n    *   For a trans-alkene, syn-addition results in a trans-epoxide.\n    *   The attack of mCPBA can occur from either the top face or the bottom face of the alkene.\n    *   Attack from the top face produces (4R, 5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Attack from the bottom face produces (4S, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   These two products, (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S), are enantiomers. Since the starting material is achiral and the attack from either face is equally likely, a racemic mixture of these two enantiomeric epoxides is formed.\n3.  **Step 2 of Reaction:** Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This causes an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction is an *anti-addition* (nucleophilic attack by water from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen). The overall process is known as anti-dihydroxylation.\n    *   Let's consider the (4R, 5R)-epoxide. The backside attack by water at C4 inverts its stereocenter, leading to (4S, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol. A backside attack at C5 would lead to (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Let's analyze the product: (4S, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol. This molecule has two stereocenters with opposite configurations (S and R) and identical substituents on each stereocenter (H, OH, propyl). This molecule has a center of inversion and is a **meso compound**. (4R, 5S) is the same meso compound.\n    *   Now, let's consider the (4S, 5S)-epoxide. A backside attack by water at either C4 or C5 will also produce the same **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by acid yields a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene.\n2.  **Step 1 of Reaction:** Treatment with mCPBA (epoxidation, *syn-addition*).\n    *   For a cis-alkene, syn-addition results in a cis-epoxide.\n    *   This cis-epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane) has a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. Regardless of which face is attacked, the same single meso epoxide is formed.\n3.  **Step 2 of Reaction:** Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺, *anti-addition*).\n    *   The ring-opening of the meso-epoxide involves a backside attack by water.\n    *   Attack at one carbon (e.g., C4) will lead to the (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon (C5) will lead to the (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The products, (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S), are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the attacks on C4 and C5 are equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by acid yields a **racemic mixture** of (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Part 3: Analyze the Product Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   Isomers (2) and (3) are **enantiomers**.\n*   Isomer (1) is a **diastereomer** of isomer (2).\n*   Isomer (1) is also a **diastereomer** of isomer (3).\n\nNow, let's predict the HPLC results:\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Thus, isomers (2) and (3) will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   An achiral column *can* separate diastereomers because they have different physical properties. Thus, the meso compound (1) will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair ((2) + (3)).\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will separate isomers (2) and (3) into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound (1), being a diastereomer to both (2) and (3), will also have a unique retention time and will be separated.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will resolve all three distinct stereoisomers and show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
