    "To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X, we must compare its mass to the sum of the masses of the potential decay products.\n\nThe interaction Lagrangian is given by:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{int}=-\\lambda{f}\\bar{\\psi}{f}\\left(y\\right)\\left(\\upsilon+X\\left(y\\right)\\right)\\psi_{f}\\left(y\\right) $$\nThis Lagrangian describes the interaction between the scalar boson X and a fermion field $\\psi_f$. The term relevant for the decay of X is the interaction term:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{X\\bar{f}f} = -\\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f $$\nThis vertex allows the boson X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, denoted as $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\nFor a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the initial particle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the final particles. In this case, for the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$:\n$$ M_X \\ge m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} $$\nSince a fermion and its corresponding antifermion have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$$ M_X \\ge 2m_f $$\nWe are given that the mass of the boson X is $M_X = 6$ GeV. Therefore, the condition for an allowed decay is:\n$$ 6 \\text{ GeV} \\ge 2m_f $$\n$$ m_f \\le 3 \\text{ GeV} $$\n\nWe now need to check this condition for all fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons). Here are their approximate masses:\n\n**Quarks:**\n*   $m_u \\approx 2.2 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0022 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.0022 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is **allowed**.\n*   $m_d \\approx 4.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0047 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.0047 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is **allowed**.\n*   $m_s \\approx 95 \\text{ MeV} = 0.095 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.095 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is **allowed**.\n*   $m_c \\approx 1.27 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.27 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is **allowed**.\n*   $m_b \\approx 4.18 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $4.18 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **forbidden**.\n*   $m_t \\approx 173 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $173 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **forbidden**.\n\n**Charged Leptons:**\n*   $m_e \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.000511 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.000511 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n*   $m_\\mu \\approx 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.1057 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.1057 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n*   $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.777 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n\nThe decay into neutrinos ($X \\rightarrow \\nu\\bar{\\nu}$) is also kinematically allowed since neutrinos have very small masses. However, they are not included in the options provided, so we will focus on the listed particles.\n\nIn summary, the kinematically allowed decays into quarks and charged leptons are:\n$X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}, s\\bar{s}, u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-}$\n\nNow, let's compare this list with the given options:\n*   A) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect: includes forbidden $b\\bar{b}$ and misses $c\\bar{c}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$)\n*   B) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Correct: matches our derived list of allowed decays)\n*   C) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect: includes forbidden $b\\bar{b}$ and misses $c\\bar{c}$)\n*   D) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect: includes forbidden $t\\bar{t}$)\n\nThe only option that correctly lists all the kinematically allowed decays is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
