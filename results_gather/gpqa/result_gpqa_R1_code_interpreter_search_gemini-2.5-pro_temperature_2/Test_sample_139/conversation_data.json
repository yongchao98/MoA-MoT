    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and deduce the presence of Deuterium.**\nThe problem states that precipitate G, when heated, releases B, and the melting point of B is very close to 277 K.\n277 Kelvin is equal to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\nThe melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). However, heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier isotope of hydrogen, Deuterium (D or ²H), has a melting point of 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a very close match.\nTherefore, substance B is heavy water, D₂O. This immediately confirms the presence of the heavier hydrogen isotope, Deuterium, which aligns with the first clue about substance X.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W.**\nThe reaction of substance X with liquid Y releases a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's analyze some simple molecules:\n*   H₂ (protium): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n*   ⁴He (helium): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p = n). Helium is an inert gas and an unlikely product of a violent reaction.\n*   ¹⁴N₂ (nitrogen): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n). Possible, but less likely given the context of heavy water.\n*   **D₂ (deuterium gas):** A molecule consists of two Deuterium atoms. Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (p = n). This fits perfectly with the identification of D₂O as substance B.\nSo, gas W is D₂.\n\n**Step 3: Deduce the reaction and identify substances X, Y, and G.**\nThe reaction of X with Y produces D₂ gas and a precipitate G. For D₂ to be produced, the deuterium must come from the reactants. Since D₂O (substance B) is produced from heating G, it's highly likely that both X and Y are deuterated compounds.\nA common violent reaction in chemistry involves a strong reducing agent (like a metal hydride) reacting with a protic substance (like water). Let's hypothesize the reaction is between a deuteride (a compound containing D⁻) and heavy water (D₂O).\n`Metal-Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) -> Metal-Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`\nThe clue about the precipitate G, which upon heating yields D₂O, points towards a metal hydroxide (or in this case, deuteroxide) that dehydrates upon heating. A prime candidate for this is Aluminium Hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, which decomposes to Al₂O₃ and H₂O. Therefore, the precipitate G is likely Aluminium Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃.\nIf G is Al(OD)₃, then substance X must contain both Aluminium (Al) and Deuterium (D).\nThis leads us to consider Lithium Aluminium Deuteride, LiAlD₄, as substance X. LiAlD₄ is the deuterated version of Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), a very powerful and common reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n\n**Step 4: Verify LiAlD₄ (Substance X) with all the clues.**\n*   **\"incorporates a heavier isotope\"**: Yes, LiAlD₄ contains Deuterium.\n*   **\"reacts violently with liquid Y\"**: Let Y be D₂O. The reaction LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂ is extremely violent, just like the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water.\n*   **\"release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\"**: The reaction produces D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n*   **\"a precipitate G forms\"**: Al(OD)₃ is a gelatinous precipitate. This fits.\n*   **\"G, when heated, releases B\"**: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. So it releases D₂O (B). This fits.\n*   **\"melting point of B ... is very close to 277 K\"**: B is D₂O, whose melting point is 276.97 K. This fits perfectly.\n*   **\"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\"**: A keto acid, such as an α-keto acid (R-CO-COOH), contains 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group. R-CO-COOH would be reduced to R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH, a diol which contains 2 oxygen atoms. This fits.\n*   **\"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\"**: LiAlH₄ is a cornerstone reagent. Its close analog is Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which is also extremely common. This fits perfectly.\n\nConclusion: Substance X is unequivocally **LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄)\". It clarifies that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\" We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes.\nThe elements in LiAlD₄, ordered by atomic number (Z), are:\n*   Hydrogen (Z=1)\n*   Lithium (Z=3)\n*   Aluminium (Z=13)\n\n1.  **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements**:\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (Al).\n\n2.  **Calculate the total mass from all atoms of the lightest element**:\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen present is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of 2.\n    *   There are four atoms of Deuterium in LiAlD₄.\n    *   Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 × 2 = 8.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total mass from all atoms of the heaviest element**:\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n    *   There is one atom of Aluminium in LiAlD₄.\n    *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n4.  **Calculate the cumulative (summed) mass**:\n    *   Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminium)\n    *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
