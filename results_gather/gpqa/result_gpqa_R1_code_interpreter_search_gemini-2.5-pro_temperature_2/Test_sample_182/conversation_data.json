    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the reactant.**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    Let's break down its structure and calculate its molecular formula and Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n    *   The base structure is `cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid`. This is a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4, and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to carbon 1.\n    *   A `formyl` group (-CHO) is attached to carbon 2.\n    *   A `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) is attached to carbon 5.\n\n    Now, let's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in the -COOH group + 1 in the -CHO group + 2 in the -CH=CH₂ group = 10 carbon atoms. (C₁₀)\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):**\n        *   On the ring: C1(1H), C2(1H), C3(1H), C4(1H), C5(1H), C6(2H) = 7H\n        *   In the functional groups: -COOH(1H), -CHO(1H), -CH=CH₂(3H) = 5H\n        *   Total hydrogens = 7 + 5 = 12 hydrogens. (H₁₂)\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in the -COOH group + 1 in the -CHO group = 3 oxygen atoms. (O₃)\n\n    The molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the IHD of the reactant.**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula using:\n    IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    For C₁₀H₁₂O₃ (oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation):\n    IHD_reactant = 10 - 12/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n\n    We can also verify this by counting the rings and pi (π) bonds in the structure:\n    *   1 ring structure = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=O bond in the formyl group = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=C bond in the vinyl group = 1 IHD\n    Total IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. This confirms our calculation.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the reaction.**\n    The reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It performs a complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds).\n    *   All C=C double bonds will be reduced to C-C single bonds.\n    *   The aldehyde group (-CHO) will be reduced completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will also be reduced completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The carbocyclic ring itself is stable and will not be opened under these conditions.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the structure and formula of the product.**\n    Starting from the reactant, C₁₀H₁₂O₃:\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `-COOH` group becomes a `-CH₃` group.\n    *   The `-CHO` group becomes a `-CH₃` group.\n    *   The `-CH=CH₂` (vinyl) group becomes a `-CH₂-CH₃` (ethyl) group.\n\n    The reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms. Thus, the product will also have 10 carbon atoms.\n    The product is a saturated substituted cycloalkane. It consists of a cyclohexane ring with two methyl groups and one ethyl group attached. The resulting molecule is an isomer of ethyl-dimethyl-cyclohexane.\n    A saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n    Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula will be **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the IHD of the product.**\n    Using the molecular formula of the product, C₁₀H₂₀:\n    IHD_product = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - 20/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\n    Alternatively, by looking at the structure of the product (a substituted cyclohexane):\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of π bonds = 0 (all double/triple bonds have been reduced)\n    IHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1 for the product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
