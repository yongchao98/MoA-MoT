    "*   **Part 1: Initial State & Dilution**\n    1.  **Initial Moles of Acetic Acid (CH3COOH):**\n        *   Volume (V_acid) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n        *   Concentration (C_acid) = 0.05 M\n        *   Moles = C_acid × V_acid = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol\n\n    2.  **Dilution:**\n        *   The acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n        *   New total volume (V_total_initial) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n        *   Concentration of diluted acetic acid (C_acid_diluted) = Moles / V_total_initial = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n*   **Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n    1.  **Concept:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (a weak acid, HA) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). The remaining 75% is unreacted acid. This creates a buffer solution.\n    2.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** The pH of a buffer is calculated using this equation:\n        pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    3.  **Calculate pKa:**\n        *   Ka = 1.85 × 10⁻⁵\n        *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    4.  **Determine the Ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n        *   At 25% titration, the ratio of moles of A⁻ to moles of HA is 25:75.\n        *   [A⁻]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\n    5.  **Calculate pH:**\n        *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n        *   pH ≈ 4.73 + (-0.48) = 4.25\n        *   This value rounds to 4.26.\n\n*   **Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n    1.  **Concept:** At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base (acetate, CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, producing OH⁻ ions.\n    2.  **Volume of NaOH added:** We need to add exactly 0.001 mol of NaOH to neutralize the 0.001 mol of acetic acid.\n        *   Volume NaOH (V_NaOH) = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n    3.  **Total Volume at Equivalence Point:**\n        *   V_total_eq = V_total_initial + V_NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n    4.  **Concentration of Acetate ([A⁻]) at Equivalence Point:**\n        *   Moles of A⁻ formed = 0.001 mol (from the initial acid)\n        *   [A⁻] = Moles / V_total_eq = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n    5.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion reacts with water:\n        CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    6.  **Calculate Kb:** The equilibrium constant for this basic reaction is Kb.\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰\n    7.  **Calculate [OH⁻]:** We can set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction, where x = [OH⁻]. The equilibrium expression is Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻]/[CH₃COO⁻] = x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n        *   x² = Kb × 0.02 = (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.08 × 10⁻¹¹\n        *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.08 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M\n    8.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n        *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. This matches option B.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Part 1: pH at 25% titration\nKa = 1.85e-5\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# The ratio of conjugate base to acid is 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npH_25 = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# Part 2: pH at the equivalence point\n# Initial moles of acetic acid\ninitial_moles_acid = 0.020 * 0.05 # 0.001 mol\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_equiv = (0.020 + 0.020) + (initial_moles_acid / 0.1) # 0.050 L\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at the equivalence point\nconc_A_minus = initial_moles_acid / total_vol_equiv # 0.02 M\n\n# Kb for acetate\nKw = 1.0e-14\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-]\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus)\npOH = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_equiv = 14.0 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is {pH_25:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is {pH_equiv:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe pH at 25% titration is 4.26\nThe pH at the equivalence point is 8.52\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n**Part 1: Initial Dilution**\n\n1.  **Initial Moles of Acetic Acid (HA):**\n    *   Volume (V_initial) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration (C_initial) = 0.05 M\n    *   Initial Moles = C_initial × V_initial = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol\n\n2.  **Dilution Step:**\n    *   Water added = 20.00 cm³\n    *   New Volume before titration (V_diluted) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n    *   New Concentration of Acetic Acid (C_diluted) = Moles / V_diluted = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n**Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** CH₃COOH (HA) + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ (A⁻) + H₂O\n2.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** At any point during the titration before the equivalence point, the solution is a buffer containing both the weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A⁻). The pH is given by:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻] / [HA])\n3.  **pKa Calculation:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n4.  **Concentration Ratio:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been converted to acetate (A⁻), and 75% remains as acetic acid (HA).\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3.\n5.  **pH Calculation:**\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n    *   **pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26**\n\n**Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Condition:** At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted completely with NaOH. The solution contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), in water.\n2.  **Volume of NaOH added:** We need to add exactly 0.001 mol of NaOH to neutralize the 0.001 mol of acetic acid.\n    *   Volume of NaOH (V_NaOH) = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n3.  **Total Volume at Equivalence Point:**\n    *   V_total_eq = V_diluted + V_NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n4.  **Concentration of Acetate ([A⁻]):**\n    *   Moles of acetate formed = initial moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / V_total_eq = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n5.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion is a weak base and hydrolyzes water to produce OH⁻.\n    *   Reaction: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n6.  **Kb Calculation:** We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n7.  **[OH⁻] Calculation:** We can find the [OH⁻] from the Kb expression: Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻]. Letting x = [OH⁻] = [HA], we have:\n    *   Kb = x² / ([A⁻] - x). Since Kb is very small, we can approximate [A⁻] - x ≈ [A⁻].\n    *   x² ≈ Kb × [A⁻] = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × (0.02) = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n8.  **pOH and pH Calculation:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517\n    *   **pH at equivalence point ≈ 8.52**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and at the equivalence point, it is 8.52.
