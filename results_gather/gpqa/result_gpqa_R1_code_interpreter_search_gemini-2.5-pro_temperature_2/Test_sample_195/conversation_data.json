    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy of the relativistic harmonic oscillator system is conserved. This total energy, $E_{total}$, is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n    The relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$. This energy includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($(\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n    The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator described by Hooke's law ($F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n    Therefore, the total conserved energy of the system is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Analyze the System at Maximum Amplitude:**\n    The maximum amplitude is the point where the particle momentarily stops and changes direction.\n    *   Position: $x = A$\n    *   Velocity: $v = 0$\n    *   At this point, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The total energy of the system at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n3.  **Analyze the System at the Equilibrium Position:**\n    The equilibrium position is where the net force on the particle is zero. This is where the potential energy is minimum, and consequently, the kinetic energy (and speed) is maximum.\n    *   Position: $x = 0$\n    *   Velocity: $v = v_{max}$\n    *   At this point, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy of the system at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n4.  **Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max:**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at the maximum amplitude is equal to the energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Now, we need to solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\n    *   Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    *   To simplify, let's rearrange the equation to isolate the term with $v_{max}$. Invert both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    *   Isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This expression perfectly matches option C.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ (Incorrect signs and missing $c^2$)\n    *   B) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (This is the non-relativistic (classical) result)\n    *   C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ (Correct)\n    *   D) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ (Incorrect signs and missing square in the denominator)\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n<<<C>>>"
