    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%.\n    *   Let's determine the empirical formula of Z. The mass fraction of carbon is 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   Let's assume we have 100 g of Z. This means we have 14.28 g of H and 85.72 g of C.\n    *   Moles of H = 14.28 g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 14.17 mol.\n    *   Moles of C = 85.72 g / 12.011 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol.\n    *   The molar ratio of H to C is 14.17 / 7.14 ≈ 1.98, which is essentially 2.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2. The general formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n    *   This general formula CnH2n corresponds to either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen (\"is not hydrogenated\"), which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". Among cycloalkanes, cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common solvent. Let's check if the mass fraction of hydrogen for cyclohexane matches.\n        *   Molar mass of C6H12 = 6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008 = 72.066 + 12.096 = 84.162 g/mol.\n        *   Mass fraction of H = (12 * 1.008) / 84.162 = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437. Using integer masses (C=12, H=1): 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. This is a perfect match for 14.28%.\n    *   Thus, we can confidently identify **Z as cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Let's call them Y1 and Y2.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning both Y1 and Y2 are saturated compounds.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. Let's say Y1 = Z = cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means hydrogenating Y1 gives cyclohexane (which is trivial) and hydrogenating Y2 also gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Since Y2 is a saturated compound that yields cyclohexane upon hydrogenation, it must be an isomer of cyclohexane that can be isomerized to the more stable six-membered ring under severe conditions. The most common isomer is methylcyclopentane (also C6H12).\n    *   Therefore, **mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and an isomer like methylcyclopentane.** However, the exact identity of the second component is not necessary to find the components of mixture X. For now, let's denote the products of the disproportionation reaction.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction from X to Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B).\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B contain C=C double bonds (they are unsaturated).\n    *   X is heated with a platinum (Pt) catalyst to form mixture Y. The reaction is a disproportionation.\n    *   Hydrogenation of *both* components of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B are C6 compounds whose carbon skeletons can be reduced to a cyclohexane ring. They are likely cyclohexene or a cyclohexadiene.\n    *   A disproportionation reaction is a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In the context of catalytic hydrogenation/dehydrogenation, this usually involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms. Some molecules lose hydrogen (oxidation), and others gain hydrogen (reduction).\n    *   Let's consider the reaction. We have an equimolar mixture of A and B reacting to form an equimolar mixture of products.\n    *   Let's propose a plausible reaction. A hydrogen transfer between two C6 unsaturated cyclic compounds. One gets reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12), and the other gets oxidized to benzene (C6H6).\n        *   Reduction: Product is C6H12 (cyclohexane).\n        *   Oxidation: Product is C6H6 (benzene).\n    *   Is this product mixture consistent with the properties of Y?\n        *   Y = {Benzene, Cyclohexane}.\n        *   Are they two liquids? Yes.\n        *   Is the mixture equimolar? Let's check the reaction stoichiometry.\n        *   Does Y decolorize bromine water? No. Benzene's aromaticity makes it unreactive to Br2 water, and cyclohexane is saturated.\n        *   Does hydrogenation of Y give only Z (cyclohexane)? Yes, hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane.\n        *   Is Z (cyclohexane) a constituent of Y? Yes.\n    *   This set of products, {Benzene, Cyclohexane}, fits all the criteria for Y.\n\n4.  **Identify Components of Mixture X**\n    *   We need to find two starting materials, A and B, that can react in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12) in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   The reaction is: A + B --(Pt)--> C6H6 + C6H12.\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule (A or B) must donate hydrogen, and the other must accept it.\n    *   The most logical donor is a cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which readily aromatizes to benzene (C6H6) by losing 2H.\n    *   The most logical acceptor is cyclohexene (C6H10), which can be reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12) by accepting 2H.\n    *   Let's write the reaction:\n        **C6H8 (a diene) + C6H10 (an ene) --(Pt)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)**\n    *   This reaction is stoichiometrically balanced and produces an equimolar mixture of the products.\n    *   Now, let's check if the proposed components for X, A=C6H8 and B=C6H10, fit the final condition: \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\"\n        *   Component B is cyclohexene, which has only one double bond, so it cannot be conjugated.\n        *   Component A is a cyclohexadiene (C6H8). There are two isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene (conjugated) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (non-conjugated, or isolated).\n        *   Since the problem forbids conjugated bonds, component A must be **cyclohexa-1,4-diene**.\n    *   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of:\n        *   **A = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**\n        *   **B = Cyclohexene (C6H10)**\n    *   Both of these will decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to form cyclohexane.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8.\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
