    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Determining the Mass Dimension of κ**\n\nIn quantum field theory, we work in natural units where $\\hbar=c=1$. In these units, mass, energy, and momentum all have dimensions of mass ($M$), and length and time have dimensions of inverse mass ($M^{-1}$).\n\n1.  **Dimension of the Action and Lagrangian:** The action, $S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$, must be a dimensionless quantity. The four-volume element $d^4x$ has dimensions of $[length]^4$, so its mass dimension is $[d^4x] = (M^{-1})^4 = M^{-4}$. For the action $S$ to be dimensionless ($[S]=M^0$), the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of $[\\mathcal{L}] = M^4$. This applies to every term in the Lagrangian, including the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$.\n    Therefore, $[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = M^4$.\n\n2.  **Dimension of the Fermion Field ψ:** The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{kin,\\psi} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. Let's focus on the derivative term $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu\\psi$.\n    *   The derivative $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has mass dimension $[\\partial_\\mu] = M^1$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless.\n    *   For this term to have the same dimension as $\\mathcal{L}$, we must have $[\\bar{\\psi}\\psi][\\partial_\\mu] = M^4$.\n    *   This implies $[\\bar{\\psi}\\psi] \\cdot M^1 = M^4$, which gives $[\\bar{\\psi}\\psi] = M^3$.\n    *   Assuming the field $\\psi$ and its conjugate $\\bar{\\psi}$ have the same mass dimension, we get $[\\psi]^2 = M^3$, so the mass dimension of the fermion field is $[\\psi] = [\\bar{\\psi}] = M^{3/2}$.\n\n3.  **Dimension of the Field Strength Tensor F<sup>μν</sup>:** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{kin,A} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   This term must also have a mass dimension of $M^4$.\n    *   So, $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = M^4$.\n    *   Therefore, the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2$.\n\n4.  **Dimension of σ<sub>μν</sub>:** The matrix $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$ is constructed from dimensionless gamma matrices. Therefore, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless, i.e., $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = M^0$.\n\n5.  **Putting it all together for κ:** Now we use the interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$. We equate the dimensions of its components to the total dimension required for a Lagrangian density term.\n    $[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] [\\bar{\\psi}] [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] [\\psi] [F^{\\mu\\nu}]$\n    $M^4 = [\\kappa] \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^0) \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^2)$\n    $M^4 = [\\kappa] \\cdot M^{(3/2 + 3/2 + 2)}$\n    $M^4 = [\\kappa] \\cdot M^{(3 + 2)}$\n    $M^4 = [\\kappa] \\cdot M^5$\n\n    Solving for the mass dimension of $\\kappa$:\n    $[\\kappa] = \\frac{M^4}{M^5} = M^{-1}$.\n\n    So, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### **Part 2: Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. For a coupling constant $g$ with mass dimension $[g] = M^d$:\n\n*   If $d > 0$, the theory is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If $d = 0$, the theory is **renormalizable**. Examples include QED and QCD.\n*   If $d < 0$, the theory is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant is $\\kappa$, and we found its mass dimension to be $d = -1$. Since the mass dimension is negative, the theory is **not renormalizable**.\n\nSuch interactions with negative mass dimension couplings are characteristic of effective field theories, which are low-energy approximations of a more fundamental theory and are only valid up to a certain energy scale. The interaction term $\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$ is known as a dimension-5 operator (the total dimension of the fields is $3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 5$), which represents the anomalous magnetic moment of the fermion.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of the coupling constant is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$.\n*   Because the mass dimension of the coupling is negative, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
