    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   We are given an atomic nucleus at rest.\n*   Its initial rest mass is `M`.\n*   Its initial rest-mass energy is `M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n*   Its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy, `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Understanding the Final State\n\n*   The nucleus fissions into two fragments. Let's call their rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Let `m1` be the more massive fragment. We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Rest Masses of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for `m1` and `m2`:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nLet's express their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\nThe total rest-mass energy of the fragments is `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 198 GeV + 99 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Applying Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before must equal the total energy after. The kinetic energy created (the Q-value of the reaction) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n    Where `T1` and `T2` are the kinetic energies of the fragments.\n    The total kinetic energy released is `Q = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n    `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV = 3000 MeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: The total momentum before must equal the total momentum after.\n    `P_initial = 0`\n    `P_final = p1 + p2 = 0`\n    This means the fragments fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n### 5. Calculating T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nWe know that `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`.\nFrom the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / 2m1) / (p^2 / 2m2) = m2 / m1`\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (99 GeV/c^2) / (198 GeV/c^2) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nSubstitute this into the sum of kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### 6. Calculating T1 using Relativistic Mechanics\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nThe total energy is also `E = T + m*c^2`.\n\nFrom momentum conservation, `p1 = p2 = p`, which means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`(p*c)^2 = E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\nSo, `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n\nFrom energy conservation, `E1 + E2 = E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. So, `E2 = M*c^2 - E1`.\n\nSubstitute `E2` into the momentum equation:\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (M*c^2 - E1)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (M*c^2)^2 - 2*E1*(M*c^2) + E1^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n\nCancel `E1^2` from both sides and rearrange to solve for `E1`:\n`-(m1*c^2)^2 = (M*c^2)^2 - 2*E1*(M*c^2) - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`2*E1*(M*c^2) = (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`E1 = [(M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2] / [2 * (M*c^2)]`\n\nNow, let's execute the calculation with a Python script to ensure precision.\n\n```python\nMc2 = 300  # GeV\nm1c2 = 198 # GeV\nm2c2 = 99  # GeV\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation for T1 ---\n# First, find the total energy of the more massive fragment (m1)\nE1 = (Mc2**2 + m1c2**2 - m2c2**2) / (2 * Mc2)\n\n# The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy\nT1_relativistic = E1 - m1c2\n\n# --- Classical Calculation for T1 ---\n# Total kinetic energy released\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Kinetic energy is shared inversely proportional to mass\nT1_classical = Q * (m2c2 / (m1c2 + m2c2))\n\n# --- Calculate the Difference ---\n# The result is in GeV, so multiply by 1000 to get MeV\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic - T1_classical) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n```\n> Relativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\n> Classical T1: 1.000 GeV\n> Difference: 5.0 MeV\n\n### 7. Final Result\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is `T1 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\nThe classically calculated kinetic energy is `T1_classical = 1.000 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = `T1 - T1_classical = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, so its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy, `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`, and its initial momentum is zero.\n\nThe nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\nWe are given:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2` (Fragment 1 is the more massive one).\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nFirst, let's find the rest masses `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy:\n`Q = T1 + T2 = (M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1**\n\nBy conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p1 = p2 = p`).\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSo, the kinetic energies of the fragments are `T1 = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2 = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n`T1 / T2 = m2 / m1 = (0.33 * M) / (0.66 * M) = 1/2`.\nSo, `T2 = 2 * T1`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`\n`T1 + (2 * T1) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1 = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T1**\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, where `E = T + m*c^2` is the total energy.\nConservation of energy: `E1 + E2 = E_initial = 300 GeV`.\nConservation of momentum: `p1 = p2` means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n\nFrom the energy-momentum relation: `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\nSo, `(p1*c)^2 = E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2` and `(p2*c)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\nEquating these gives: `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n\nSubstitute `E2 = 300 - E1` into the equation:\n`E1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E1)^2 - (99)^2`\n`E1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1 + E1^2) - 9801`\n`-39204 = 90000 - 600*E1 - 9801`\n`600*E1 = 90000 - 9801 + 39204`\n`600*E1 = 119403`\n`E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`.\n\nThis `E1` is the total energy (rest mass + kinetic) of the more massive fragment. Its kinetic energy `T1` is:\n`T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**Finding the Difference**\n\nDifference = (Correct T1) - (Classical T1)\nDifference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
