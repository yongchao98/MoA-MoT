    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 (Te_4 / Te_2).\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for equilibrium temperature (Te):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is derived as follows:\n    *   Energy Absorbed ∝ (1 - A) / a², where A is the albedo and 'a' is the orbital distance.\n    *   Energy Radiated ∝ Te⁴ (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law).\n    *   Setting absorbed energy equal to radiated energy: Te⁴ ∝ (1 - A) / a².\n    *   Taking the fourth root of both sides: Te ∝ [(1 - A) / a²]¹/⁴.\n    *   The problem states that the albedo (A) is the same for all planets. The stellar properties are also constant. Therefore, we can simplify the relationship to: Te ∝ (1/a²)¹/⁴ or Te ∝ 1 / a¹/².\n\n3.  **Relate orbital distance (a) to orbital period (T):** Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    *   T² ∝ a³\n    *   Solving for 'a': a ∝ T²/³.\n\n4.  **Combine the relationships to express Te in terms of T:** Now, substitute the relationship for 'a' from Kepler's law into the temperature relationship.\n    *   We have Te ∝ 1 / a¹/² and a ∝ T²/³.\n    *   Substituting 'a' gives: Te ∝ 1 / (T²/³)¹/².\n    *   Simplifying the exponent: Te ∝ 1 / T⁽²/³⁾*⁽¹/²⁾ = 1 / T¹/³.\n\n5.  **Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:** Using the proportionality derived in the previous step, we can set up the ratio for Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n    *   Te_4 / Te_2 = (1 / T₄¹/³) / (1 / T₂¹/³)\n    *   Te_4 / Te_2 = (T₂ / T₄)¹/³\n\n6.  **Use the given orbital period ratios:** The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as T₁:T₂:T₃:T₄:T₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   From this, the ratio T₂ / T₄ is 2 / 3.5.\n\n7.  **Perform the final calculation:** Substitute the period ratio into the temperature ratio equation.\n    *   Te_4 / Te_2 = (2 / 3.5)¹/³\n    *   Te_4 / Te_2 = (4 / 7)¹/³\n    *   To get the numerical value, we compute the cube root of (4/7).\n\nI will use a short Python script to compute this value accurately.\n```python\n# The ratio of orbital periods T2/T4 is 2/3.5\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the period ratio (T2/T4)^(1/3)\ntemp_ratio = period_ratio ** (1/3)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.8298716208642951\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.8299, which rounds to 0.83. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (Te₄ / Te₂) can be determined from their orbital properties.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (Te) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (a) from its star, assuming other factors like albedo and stellar luminosity are constant.\n    Te ∝ 1 / a^(1/2)\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (T) of a planet to its orbital distance (a). The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance.\n    T² ∝ a³\n    This can be rearranged to express the orbital distance in terms of the period:\n    a ∝ T^(2/3)\n\n3.  **Relating Temperature and Period:**\n    By substituting the expression for 'a' from Kepler's Law into the temperature formula, we can find the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period:\n    Te ∝ 1 / [T^(2/3)]^(1/2)\n    Te ∝ 1 / T^[(2/3) * (1/2)]\n    Te ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio:**\n    Now we can set up the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n    Te₄ / Te₂ = [1 / T₄^(1/3)] / [1 / T₂^(1/3)]\n    Te₄ / Te₂ = (T₂ / T₄)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Using the Given Period Ratios:**\n    The problem states the orbital period ratios are T₁ : T₂ : T₃ : T₄ : T₅ = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n    From this, we can take the relative period for Planet_2 as T₂ = 2 and for Planet_4 as T₄ = 3.5.\n    The ratio T₂ / T₄ = 2 / 3.5.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the period ratio into the temperature ratio equation:\n    Te₄ / Te₂ = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    Te₄ / Te₂ = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n    Te₄ / Te₂ ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n    Te₄ / Te₂ ≈ 0.8299\n\nRounding the result to two decimal places gives 0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>"
