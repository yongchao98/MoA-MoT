  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of Compound X from the given spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm-1 (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1:** These peaks are in the region for C=C stretching, indicating the presence of an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet, very downfield, is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are characteristic of a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the doublet at 7.2 ppm is ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl Substituent Analysis:** Let's piece together the structure of the other substituent from the remaining signals:\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This is part of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with the methylene group (-CH2-) of the ethyl fragment, which is adjacent to both the methyl group and another group.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a single proton (-CH-).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is consistent with the methine proton (-CH-) which is bonded to the aromatic ring, the methyl group (at 1.4 ppm), and the ethyl group (starting at 1.7 ppm).\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are -CH- , a -CH3 attached to it, and a -CH2CH3 also attached to it. This forms a `sec`-butyl group: -CH(CH3)(CH2CH3).\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the information, Compound X is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a *sec*-butyl group in a para-arrangement. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C), which is the starting material, not the final product.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reagent Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH3). It can also reduce alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones to their corresponding alkanes.\n    *   **Applying the reaction:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3). The rest of the molecule (the benzene ring and the *sec*-butyl group) will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n    *   **Final Product:** The product will have a *sec*-butyl group and a methyl group in a para-arrangement on the benzene ring. The name of this compound is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This matches our predicted final product.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: The alkyl group is *sec*-butyl, not isobutyl.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
