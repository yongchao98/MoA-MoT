    "This problem requires calculating the total relativistic energy of a Lithium-6 (⁶Li) nucleus moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n\n### **1. Identify the Nucleus and its Properties**\n*   The problem defines nucleus X as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium's atomic number (Z) is 3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n*   The speed of the nucleus is given as v = 0.96c, where c is the speed of light.\n\n### **2. Determine the Rest Mass and Rest Energy of the Nucleus**\nTo calculate the total energy, we first need the rest mass (m₀) of the ⁶Li nucleus. We can find this value from standard nuclear data tables.\n\n*   The mass of a ⁶Li atom is approximately 6.015122795 atomic mass units (u).\n*   The mass of 3 electrons is 3 * 0.00054858 u = 0.00164574 u.\n*   The mass of the ⁶Li nucleus is the atomic mass minus the electron mass:\n    m₀ = 6.015122795 u - 0.00164574 u = 6.013477055 u.\n\nNext, we convert this rest mass into rest energy (E₀) using the mass-energy equivalence principle (E=mc²). The conversion factor from atomic mass units (u) to Giga-electron volts (GeV) is approximately 1 u = 0.931494 GeV/c².\n\n*   Rest Energy (E₀) = m₀ * c²\n    E₀ = 6.013477055 u * 0.931494 GeV/u = 5.601509 GeV.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Relativistic Energy**\nThe total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula:\nE = γ * E₀ = γ * m₀ * c²\n\nwhere γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (v²/c²))\n\nFirst, we calculate the Lorentz factor for v = 0.96c:\n*   (v/c)² = (0.96c / c)² = 0.96² = 0.9216\n*   √(1 - 0.9216) = √0.0784 = 0.28\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714\n\nNow, we can calculate the total energy E:\n*   E = γ * E₀\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.601509 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.005 GeV\n\nThis value is very close to one of the options.\n\nTo get a more precise result, we can use a computational approach to avoid rounding errors.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and given values\nspeed_ratio = 0.96  # v/c\nmass_Li6_nucleus_u = 6.013477055  # Mass of 6Li nucleus in atomic mass units (u)\nu_to_GeV = 0.931494102  # Conversion factor from u to GeV/c^2\n\n# 1. Calculate the rest energy (E0) in GeV\nrest_energy_GeV = mass_Li6_nucleus_u * u_to_GeV\n\n# 2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - speed_ratio**2)\n\n# 3. Calculate the total relativistic energy (E)\ntotal_energy_GeV = gamma * rest_energy_GeV\n\n# Print the result rounded to the required precision (1e-4)\nprint(f\"{total_energy_GeV:.4f}\")\n```\nExecuting this code gives the result:\n```\n20.0054\n```\nThis value of 20.0054 GeV is extremely close to option B, which is 20.132 GeV. The minor discrepancy (around 0.6%) likely arises from using slightly different standard values for the mass of ⁶Li or the conversion constant. Comparing our calculated result with the provided options, 20.132 GeV is the most plausible answer.\n\nLet's quickly check the calculation assuming the intended answer is exactly 20.132 GeV to see what rest energy that would imply:\nRequired Rest Energy = Total Energy / gamma = 20.132 GeV / 3.5714 = 5.637 GeV.\nThis corresponds to a nuclear mass of 5.637 GeV / 0.9315 GeV/u ≈ 6.051 u, which is reasonably close to our initial value for the ⁶Li nucleus.\n\nTherefore, the calculated energy is most consistent with option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants to find the total relativistic energy of a specific nucleus moving at a given velocity.\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Properties**\n\n*   The problem specifies the nucleus as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   The atomic number (Z) of Lithium is 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n*   Thus, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n**2. Identify the Given Velocity**\n\n*   The speed of the nucleus is v = 0.96c, where c is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Define the Relativistic Energy Formula**\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula:\nE = γ * E₀ = γ * m₀ * c²\n\nWhere:\n*   E₀ is the rest energy (m₀c²).\n*   m₀ is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\n*   Given v = 0.96c, the ratio v/c is 0.96.\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96)²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n*   γ = 1 / √0.0784\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28\n*   γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n**5. Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀)**\n\nFirst, we need the rest mass of the ⁶Li nucleus. In particle accelerators, atoms are stripped of their electrons, so we use the mass of the bare nucleus.\n\n*   The standard mass of a ⁶Li nucleus (m₀) is approximately 6.0135 atomic mass units (u).\n*   The energy equivalent of one atomic mass unit is approximately 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c² or 0.9315 GeV/c².\n*   E₀ = m₀ * c² = (6.0135 u) * (0.9315 GeV/u)\n*   E₀ ≈ 5.6015 GeV\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\n\nNow we multiply the rest energy by the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   E = γ * E₀\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6015 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.005 GeV\n\nTo refine this calculation and match the precision requested, we can use a more precise set of constants and a script. The python code generated and executed in the thinking process performed this calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and given values\nspeed_ratio = 0.96  # v/c\n# More precise mass of 6Li nucleus from literature is ~6.013477 u\nmass_Li6_nucleus_u = 6.013477055  # Mass of 6Li nucleus in atomic mass units (u)\n# More precise u-to-GeV conversion factor\nu_to_GeV = 0.931494102  # Conversion factor from u to GeV/c^2\n\n# 1. Calculate the rest energy (E0) in GeV\nrest_energy_GeV = mass_Li6_nucleus_u * u_to_GeV\n\n# 2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - speed_ratio**2)\n\n# 3. Calculate the total relativistic energy (E)\ntotal_energy_GeV = gamma * rest_energy_GeV\n\n# Print the result rounded to the required precision (1e-4)\nprint(f\"{total_energy_GeV:.4f}\")\n\n```\nThe output of this code was `20.0054`.\n\n**7. Compare with Options and Conclude**\n\nLet's compare our calculated value of 20.0054 GeV with the given options:\nA) 21.419 GeV\nB) 20.132 GeV\nC) 18.475 GeV\nD) 23.069 GeV\n\nOur calculated energy (20.0054 GeV) is closest to option B (20.132 GeV). The minor difference of about 0.6% can be attributed to the specific values of the constants (mass of ⁶Li, u-to-GeV conversion) used by the source of the problem. Among the choices provided, 20.132 GeV is the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
