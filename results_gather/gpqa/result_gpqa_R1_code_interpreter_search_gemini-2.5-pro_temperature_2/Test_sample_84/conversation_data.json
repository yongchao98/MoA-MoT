    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. The Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\nWe need to find T_eq1 / T_eq2. Let's write out the ratio using the formula above:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both. It also specifies that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a_1)) * ((2 * a_2) / R_star))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets' orbits.\n\n**4. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data:**\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift (Δλ) caused by each planet.\n\nThe maximum radial velocity of the star (the semi-amplitude, K_star) is related to the planet's properties. For a circular orbit (as stated in the problem) and assuming the orbital inclination `i` is 90° (a good assumption since the planets are detected by the transit method), the formula is:\nK_star = (M_p / M_star) * v_orbit\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `v_orbit` is the planet's orbital velocity.\n\nThe orbital velocity is given by `v_orbit = sqrt(G * M_star / a)`. Substituting this in:\nK_star = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nNow, let's solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\nK_star^2 = M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes:**\nNow we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\na_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_star2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_star1^2)]\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out:\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / M_p1^2) * (K_star1^2 / K_star2^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\n**6. Relate K_star to the Given Doppler Shift (Δλ):**\nThe radial velocity `K_star` is found from the Doppler shift using the formula:\nK_star = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength.\n\nThe ratio `K_star1 / K_star2` is:\nK_star1 / K_star2 = [c * (Δλ_1 / λ_0)] / [c * (Δλ_2 / λ_0)] = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n\n**7. Combine the Ratios:**\nSubstitute the expression for `K_star1 / K_star2` back into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\n**8. Substitute the Numerical Values:**\nFrom the problem description:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nNow, plug these into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\na_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (0.03 / 0.04)^2\na_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (3 / 4)^2\na_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\n**9. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\nWe found earlier that `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`.\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nTo get the final numerical answer, we perform the division.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes\n# a2/a1 = (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (delta_lambda1/delta_lambda2)^2\nMp_ratio = 5 / 7\nlambda_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\na_ratio = (Mp_ratio**2) * (lambda_ratio**2)\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\n# Teq1/Teq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\nTeq_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio)\n\nprint(Teq_ratio)\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature `(T_eq)` of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** Let's write down the ratio for our two planets:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem provides several key pieces of information that allow us to simplify this equation:\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (`A₁ = A₂`), so the term `(1 - A)^(1/4)` also cancels out.\n    *   The `sqrt(1 / 2)` term is common to both numerator and denominator and also cancels.\n\n    After simplification, the ratio becomes:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a₁) / sqrt(1 / a₂)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n\n    This means we only need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n5.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data:** The problem gives us data from the radial velocity (RV) method. The maximum Doppler shift `(Δλ)` is proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity `(K_star)`, which is caused by the planet's gravitational pull.\n\n    *   For a circular orbit (as stated in the problem), the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude `(K_star)` is given by:\n        `K_star = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n        where `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `a` is the semi-major axis. (This formula assumes we are viewing the system edge-on, i.e., inclination i=90°, which is a valid assumption for transiting planets).\n\n    *   The observed maximum Doppler shift `(Δλ)` is related to `K_star` by the non-relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n        `K_star / c = Δλ / λ₀`  => `K_star = c * (Δλ / λ₀)`\n        where `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n6.  **Deriving the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes `(a₂ / a₁)`:** Let's rearrange the `K_star` formula to solve for `a`:\n    `K_star² = M_p² * G / (M_star * a)`\n    `a = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K_star²)`\n\n    Now, we can form the ratio `a₂ / a₁`:\n    `a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K_star2²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K_star1²)]`\n\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out:\n    `a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / M_p1²) * (K_star1² / K_star2²)`\n\n    We also know that `K_star` is proportional to `Δλ`. So, `K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`. Substituting this in:\n    `a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²`\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Now we can substitute this expression for `a₂ / a₁` back into our simplified temperature ratio formula:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt((M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)`\n\n8.  **Plugging in the Values:**\n    *   Mass of Planet 1 `(M_p1)` = 7 Earth masses\n    *   Mass of Planet 2 `(M_p2)` = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Doppler shift from Planet 1 `(Δλ₁)` = 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift from Planet 2 `(Δλ₂)` = 0.04 Å\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\n    Calculating the decimal value:\n    `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n9.  **Comparison with Options:** The calculated value `~0.536` matches option C. The provided information about the star's mass, radius, temperature, and the planets' radii are not needed for the final ratio calculation, as they cancel out.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\n# Masses of the planets (in Earth masses)\nMp1 = 7.0\nMp2 = 5.0\n\n# Doppler shifts (in Angstroms)\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1)\n# a2 / a1 = (Mp2 / Mp1)^2 * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)^2\nmass_ratio = Mp2 / Mp1\nlambda_shift_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\nsemi_major_axis_ratio = (mass_ratio**2) * (lambda_shift_ratio**2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (Teq1 / Teq2)\n# Teq1 / Teq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n# Alternatively, from the derivation: Teq1 / Teq2 = (Mp2 / Mp1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * lambda_shift_ratio\n\n# Print the result\nprint(temp_ratio)\n\n```\n<<<C>>>",
