    "*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule containing the most abundant isotope of each element.\n    *   There is a second peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of 32% (compared to 100% for the M+ peak). The ratio of the intensities of the M+ to M+2 peaks is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a definitive indicator of the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule. Chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (75.77% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (24.23% abundance). The peak at m/z=156 corresponds to the molecule with a ³⁵Cl isotope, and the peak at m/z=158 corresponds to the molecule with a ³⁷Cl isotope.\n    *   All the given options (A, B, C, D) are isomers with the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂, and the molecular weight calculated with the ³⁵Cl isotope is indeed 156 g/mol ((7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + 35 + (2 * 16) = 156). Thus, the mass spectrum confirms the presence of one chlorine atom and is consistent with the molecular formula of all options.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with the carbonyl group in an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   These two features together provide strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate option B (aldehyde and phenol) and option C (chloroformate ester), as they do not contain a carboxylic acid group. We are left with options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, which is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. It appears as a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons and integrates to one proton (1H). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-9 ppm). We observe two signals, each a doublet (d), and each integrating to two protons (2H). This symmetrical pattern of two doublets for a total of four aromatic protons is the hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, the four protons on the ring are chemically equivalent in two sets of two. The protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent, and the protons ortho to the other substituent are equivalent. These two sets of protons are adjacent to each other, so they split each other's signals into doublets.\n    *   Comparing this pattern to our remaining options:\n        *   A) **2-chlorobenzoic acid** is ortho-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). This would result in four chemically distinct aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (four separate signals, likely multiplets), not two simple doublets.\n        *   D) **4-chlorobenzoic acid** is para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). This structure has the necessary symmetry to produce exactly the observed NMR spectrum: two doublets, each representing two protons. The protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group) are deshielded and correspond to the downfield doublet at 8.02 ppm. The protons at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to the chlorine atom) correspond to the doublet at 7.72 ppm.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular weight and the presence of chlorine. The IR confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and specifies the para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<D>>>"
