The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks.

Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\n*   **Observation**: The LC-MS experiment separates the crude compound into two distinct peaks. Crucially, the mass spectrum for *both* peaks is identical and matches the mass of the expected product molecule.\n*   **Interpretation**: This is the most definitive piece of evidence. It proves that the two compounds being observed are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Elimination**: This finding immediately allows us to rule out explanations that would result in a product with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Option (D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**: A precursor would be a starting material or intermediate from the synthesis and would have a different (usually lower) mass. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n    *   **Option (B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**: This side reaction implies the addition of an extra molecular fragment, which would result in a product with a different (higher) mass. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data\nHaving established that the mixture consists of two isomers, we must now use the remaining data to determine the specific type of isomeric relationship.\n\n*   **Observation**: The crude compound is separated into two distinct peaks by liquid chromatography (LC) and shows two distinct signals for a single alpha-proton in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **Interpretation**: These observations show that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct entities. They have different physical properties (which allows for their separation by LC) and their corresponding protons exist in different chemical environments (which causes them to have different signals in the NMR spectrum).\n\n### 3. Evaluation of the Remaining Isomer Options\nWe are left with two possibilities: a mixture of enantiomers or a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n*   **Option (A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**:\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have **identical** physical and chemical properties in a standard (achiral) analytical environment.\n    *   Because of this, enantiomers **cannot be separated** by a standard LC column and would elute as a single peak. They are also **indistinguishable** by a standard NMR spectrometer and would produce a single, identical set of signals.\n    *   These facts are in direct contradiction to the observation of two separate peaks in both the LC and NMR experiments. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option (C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**:\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. This is a common situation in peptide synthesis, often caused by the partial inversion (epimerization) of a chiral center, or by the presence of stable *cis*/*trans* isomers around an amide bond (these are known as rotamers, which are a class of diastereomer).\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   This perfectly explains all observations:\n        1.  They have the same mass, consistent with the MS data.\n        2.  Their different physical properties allow them to be separated by LC, explaining the two peaks in the chromatogram.\n        3.  Their different chemical environments cause their NMR spectra to be different, explaining the two signals for the alpha-proton.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined analytical data—the presence of two isomers (same mass) that are separable by standard chromatography and distinguishable by standard NMR—is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most logical explanation for the experimental observations.\n\n**1. Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Observation:** The LC-MS analysis reveals two separate peaks in the chromatogram, but crucially, both peaks yield the *exact same mass spectrum*. Furthermore, this mass corresponds to the expected product molecule.\n*   **Interpretation:** This is the most definitive piece of evidence. It proves that the two species in the mixture are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in the arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Elimination:** This fact immediately rules out any explanation involving a different molecular weight.\n    *   This eliminates **(B) 'Double coupling' has occurred...**, as this side reaction would produce a product with a higher mass.\n    *   This eliminates **(C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**, as a precursor molecule would have a different (usually lower) mass.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data to Differentiate Isomers**\nNow that we have established the mixture consists of isomers, we must differentiate between the remaining possibilities: enantiomers (D) and diastereoisomers (A).\n\n*   **Observation:** The crude compound gives two separate peaks in standard Liquid Chromatography (LC) and two distinct signals for a single proton in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **Interpretation:** These observations indicate that the two isomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   The separation by LC means they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, shape), causing them to interact differently with the chromatography column.\n    *   The distinct NMR signals mean a specific proton exists in a different chemical environment in each of the two isomers.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Options**\n*   **Option (D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have **identical** physical and chemical properties in a standard (achiral) environment.\n    *   Therefore, enantiomers are **not separable by standard LC** and are **indistinguishable by standard NMR**. They would appear as a single peak in both techniques.\n    *   This contradicts the experimental data, so option (D) is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option (A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images.\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   This difference in properties explains why they can be **separated by standard LC** and why they produce **distinct NMR spectra**.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the experimental evidence. Such a mixture is common in peptide synthesis, often due to epimerization (the inversion of a single stereocenter) or the presence of stable cis/trans rotamers around a peptide bond, which are also a form of diastereoisomers.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe collective evidence—the presence of two isomers (confirmed by MS) that are separable and distinguishable by standard chromatographic and spectroscopic methods (LC and NMR)—unambiguously points to a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, considering all careful points from the evidence provided.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\n\nThis is the most critical starting point as it provides the most definitive information.\n*   **Observation**: The LC-MS analysis shows two separate peaks in the chromatogram (LC). However, the mass spectrum (MS) for *both* peaks is identical and matches the mass of the expected molecule.\n*   **Careful Point**: The identity of the mass for both peaks proves they are **isomers**. Isomers are molecules that have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in the arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Conclusion**: This observation immediately rules out any explanation involving impurities with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Eliminates Option A ('Double coupling')**: This side reaction would create a product with a *higher* molecular weight. This contradicts the MS data.\n    *   **Eliminates Option C (Contamination with a precursor)**: A precursor would be a starting material or intermediate and would have a *different* (usually lower) molecular weight. This also contradicts the MS data.\n\n### Step 2: Differentiate Between the Remaining Isomer Types\n\nAfter Step 1, we are left with two possibilities for the isomeric mixture: enantiomers (Option B) or diastereoisomers (Option D). To distinguish between these, we must analyze the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **Observation from NMR and LC**:\n    1.  The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct signals for a single alpha-proton.\n    2.  The LC separates the sample into two distinct peaks.\n*   **Careful Point**: These observations indicate that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct. They can be separated by a standard chromatography column, and they give different signals in a standard NMR experiment. This means they must have different properties in a standard (achiral) environment.\n\n*   **Evaluating Option B (Mixture of Enantiomers)**:\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they possess **identical** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   Because they are identical in this context, they are **indistinguishable** by standard ¹H NMR (they would produce a single signal set) and **inseparable** by standard LC (they would elute as a single peak).\n    *   **Conclusion**: This option is in direct contradiction to both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **Evaluating Option D (Mixture of Diastereoisomers)**:\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. (A common example in peptide synthesis is the epimerization of a chiral center, for instance, a peptide containing L-Alanine and L-Leucine could partially convert to D-Alanine and L-Leucine; these two molecules, L-Ala-L-Leu and D-Ala-L-Leu, would be diastereomers).\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties in all environments (both chiral and achiral).\n    *   **Consistency with Data**:\n        *   Their different physical properties explain why they separate into two peaks on an LC column.\n        *   Their different chemical properties and 3D structures explain why their NMR spectra are different, resulting in two distinct peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   Their status as isomers explains why they have the same mass.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This explanation is perfectly consistent with every piece of experimental data provided.\n\n### Final Summary\n\nThe combination of observing two species that (1) have the same mass, (2) are separable by standard chromatography, and (3) are distinguishable by standard NMR spectroscopy is the definitive analytical signature for a mixture of **diastereoisomers**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe goal is to determine the most likely identity of a synthetic peptide sample based on ¹H NMR and LC-MS data. Let's break down the evidence systematically.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** The LC-MS analysis reveals two distinct peaks in the chromatogram, but both peaks yield the *exact same mass spectrum*. Furthermore, this mass corresponds to the expected mass of the target peptide molecule.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is the most critical piece of evidence. It definitively proves that the two species present in the sample are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in their three-dimensional arrangement.\n    *   **Elimination:** This fact immediately rules out any explanation involving a different molecular formula or mass.\n        *   **Option A ('Double coupling'):** This side reaction would create a product with a higher mass. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n        *   **Option C (Contamination with a precursor):** A precursor from an earlier synthetic step would have a different (usually lower) mass. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data to Identify the Isomer Type:**\n    *   With options A and C eliminated, we are left to decide between a mixture of enantiomers (D) or diastereoisomers (B).\n    *   **Observation:** The two isomers are separable by standard Liquid Chromatography (LC) and distinguishable by ¹H NMR spectroscopy (a single proton gives rise to two distinct signals).\n    *   **Evaluation of Option D (Enantiomers):** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   On a standard LC column, enantiomers are not separated and would elute together as a single peak.\n        *   In a standard NMR spectrometer (using an achiral solvent), enantiomers are indistinguishable and would produce a single, identical set of signals.\n        *   Since the experimental data shows two separate peaks in both LC and NMR, the mixture cannot be composed of enantiomers.\n    *   **Evaluation of Option B (Diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. A common example in peptide synthesis is the accidental inversion (epimerization) of one of the chiral centers, leading to a mix of, for example, L-L and L-D peptides.\n        *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n        *   Because they have different properties, they are readily separable by standard LC, which explains the two observed peaks in the chromatogram.\n        *   Because they are chemically distinct molecules, their corresponding protons exist in different electronic environments, which explains why a single alpha-proton would produce two different signals in the NMR spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combined experimental evidence leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion. The sample consists of two species that are isomers (same mass) but are not enantiomers (they are separable and distinguishable by standard analytical methods). By definition, these must be diastereoisomers. This explanation is fully consistent with all provided data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of the provided analytical data (<sup>1</sup>H NMR and LC-MS) to deduce the nature of the crude compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\nThe most critical piece of evidence comes from the mass spectrometer.\n*   **Observation**: The LC separates the sample into two peaks, but both peaks give the **exact same mass spectrum**. Furthermore, this mass is consistent with the **expected product molecule**.\n*   **Interpretation**: This proves that the two species in the sample are **isomers**. They have the same chemical formula and therefore the same molecular weight, but they differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Elimination**: This fact immediately rules out any options that would result in a product with a different molecular weight:\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred...**: This would create a product with a higher mass than expected. This is incorrect.\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**: A precursor from an earlier synthetic step would have a different (usually lower) mass. This is incorrect.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the NMR and Chromatography (LC) Data**\nNow that we have established the two species are isomers, we must distinguish between the remaining possibilities: enantiomers and diastereoisomers.\n*   **Observations**:\n    1.  The <sup>1</sup>H NMR shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    2.  The LC trace shows two clearly separated peaks.\n*   **Interpretation**: These observations show that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct entities. They can be separated by chromatography (meaning they have different physical properties like polarity) and are distinguishable by NMR (meaning a proton within each has a different chemical environment).\n*   **Evaluating the remaining options**:\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have **identical** physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they **cannot be separated** by standard LC (they would elute as a single peak) and are **indistinguishable** by standard NMR (they would produce a single set of signals). This explanation is in direct contradiction to both the LC and NMR data. This is incorrect.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images. They have **different** physical and chemical properties in all environments. This means they are expected to have different NMR spectra and are separable by standard LC. This explanation is perfectly consistent with all observations: two isomers with the same mass that can be separated and have distinct chemical signatures in an NMR spectrum. This is a common phenomenon in peptide synthesis, often caused by the partial inversion of a chiral center (epimerization) or by stable cis/trans isomers around a peptide bond (rotamers).\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe collective evidence points to a single, unambiguous conclusion: the crude compound is a mixture of two diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**: The most critical piece of evidence is from the LC-MS. The analysis shows two separate peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC), but both peaks produce the *exact same mass spectrum*. Furthermore, this mass spectrum is consistent with the expected product.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This definitively proves that the two species in the sample are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in their 3D atomic arrangement.\n    *   **Elimination**: This fact immediately rules out any explanation involving impurities with a different molecular weight.\n        *   Option (C) **\"contaminated with a precursor\"** is incorrect because a precursor would have a different (likely lower) mass.\n        *   Option (D) **\"'Double coupling' has occurred\"** is incorrect because this side-reaction would create a product with a different (likely higher) mass.\n\n2.  **Analyze the NMR and Chromatography (LC) Data**: With only the isomer options remaining (A and B), we use the other data to distinguish between them.\n    *   **Observation**: The sample produces two distinct peaks in both the ¹H NMR (for the same proton) and the LC chromatogram. This indicates the presence of two species that are distinguishable and separable using standard achiral analytical techniques.\n    *   **Evaluate Option (B) - Enantiomers**: Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they possess **identical** physical and chemical properties.

A common example in peptide synthesis is epimerization, where an L-amino acid center inverts to a D-center, creating a diastereomeric pair (e.g., an L-L peptide vs. an L-D peptide). Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n        *   Their different properties allow them to be separated by standard LC, explaining the **two LC peaks**.\n        *   Their different chemical environments mean their nuclei will have different resonances in NMR, explaining the **two NMR peaks**.\n        *   As isomers, they have the same mass, consistent with the **MS data**.\n        *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all experimental evidence.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe combined data provides a classic analytical signature for a mixture of diastereoisomers. The two species have the same mass (are isomers) but can be separated and distinguished by standard chromatography and spectroscopy because they have different physical and chemical properties.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers, here is a consolidated step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data.**\nThe most critical piece of evidence is from the LC-MS analysis. It shows two separate peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace, but crucially, the mass spectrometry (MS) data reveals that *both peaks have the same mass spectrum*. Furthermore, this mass is consistent with the expected target molecule.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The two chemical species in the sample must be **isomers**—molecules with the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight, but with a different spatial arrangement of atoms.\n*   **Elimination:** This fact immediately rules out options that describe impurities with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor molecule would have a different (likely lower) mass. This is incorrect.\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This describes a side reaction that would create a product with a different (likely higher) mass. This is also incorrect.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Liquid Chromatography (LC) Data.**\nNow that we know the sample is a mixture of isomers, we must use the remaining data to distinguish between the two remaining possibilities: a mixture of enantiomers or a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n*   **Observations:**\n    1.  The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct signals for a single alpha-proton.\n    2.  The LC separates the sample into two distinct peaks.\n*   **Interpretation:** For two species to be distinguishable by standard NMR and separable by standard LC, they must have **different physical and chemical properties** in a standard (achiral) environment.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Options.**\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have **identical** physical and chemical properties in achiral environments.\n    *   Therefore, enantiomers would *not* separate on a standard LC column (they would give a single peak) and would *not* be distinguishable by a standard NMR spectrometer (they would produce a single, identical set of signals).\n    *   This is in direct contradiction to the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. A common example in peptide synthesis is epimerization, where one chiral center inverts (e.g., an L-amino acid becomes a D-amino acid in a peptide that has other L-amino acids).\n    *   Diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties. This means they will separate on a standard LC column and will have different NMR spectra.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all experimental observations: two isomers (same mass) that are separable and have distinct chemical signatures.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of observing two species that are isomers (same mass), but which can be separated by standard chromatography and distinguished by standard NMR, is the classic analytical signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided evidence.\n\n### **Analysis of Experimental Data**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Evidence:**\n    *   **Observation:** The LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the chromatogram (LC). Critically, both of these peaks produce the *exact same mass spectrum*, which is consistent with the mass of the expected peptide.\n    *   **Careful Point/Conclusion:** This is the most definitive piece of information. It proves that the two species in the mixture are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in their 3D arrangement. This single fact allows us to immediately rule out explanations that involve components with different molecular weights.\n\n2.  **Chromatography (LC) and NMR Evidence:**\n    *   **Observation:** The crude sample is separated into two distinct peaks of roughly equal intensity by liquid chromatography. Likewise, the ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks of roughly equal intensity for a single type of proton (the alpha-proton).\n    *   **Careful Point/Conclusion:** These observations show that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct from each other. They have different physical properties (which allows for separation by LC) and their protons exist in different chemical environments (which causes them to have different signals in the NMR spectrum).\n\n### **Evaluation of the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can now evaluate each option:\n\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction** and **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**: Both of these scenarios describe impurities that would have a different chemical formula and therefore a **different molecular weight** than the target peptide. The mass spectrometry data, which shows both components have the same, expected mass, directly contradicts these possibilities. Therefore, options B and C are incorrect.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. A key characteristic is that they have **identical** physical and chemical properties in a standard (achiral) environment.\n    *   This means they would **not** separate on a standard LC column (producing only one peak).\n    *   This also means they are **indistinguishable** in a standard NMR spectrum (producing only one set of signals).\n    *   Since the experimental data clearly shows two peaks in both the LC and NMR, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. This is a common phenomenon in peptide synthesis, often resulting from the epimerization (inversion of a chiral center) of one amino acid or from cis/trans isomerism around a peptide bond (forming rotamers).\n    *   As isomers, they have the **same mass**, which is consistent with the MS data.\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties. This means they are **separable by standard LC** and will produce **different NMR spectra**.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all experimental observations.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of observing two species that have the same mass (isomers) but can be separated by standard chromatography and distinguished by standard NMR is the classic analytical signature of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most likely explanation for the observations.\n\n**1. Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\nThe most critical piece of evidence comes from the mass spectrometer. The problem states that the LC-MS analysis shows two clearly defined peaks, and importantly, **both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule.**\n\n*   **Interpretation:** This proves that the two species present in the sample are **isomers**. Isomers have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight, but a different spatial arrangement of atoms.\n*   **Elimination:** This fact allows us to immediately rule out any explanation that involves a product with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Option B (Double Coupling):** A \"double coupling\" side reaction would involve adding an extra chemical moiety (e.g., another amino acid), resulting in a product with a higher mass. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n    *   **Option C (Contaminated with Precursor):** A precursor from a previous synthetic step would have a different chemical formula and a different (usually lower) mass. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data to Distinguish Isomers**\n\nWe have established that the sample is a mixture of two isomers. The remaining options are a mixture of diastereoisomers (A) or enantiomers (D). We must use the other pieces of data to differentiate between them.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Observation:** A single alpha-proton appears as two separate peaks of equal integral.\n*   **LC Observation:** The two species are separable into two distinct peaks.\n*   **Interpretation:** These two observations show that the two isomers are distinguishable by standard analytical techniques. They have different physical properties (which allows for separation by LC) and their atoms exist in slightly different chemical environments (which leads to different NMR signals).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Options**\n\n*   **Option D (Mixture of enantiomers):** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images.

This is a common situation in peptide synthesis, for instance, if one of the chiral amino acids undergoes epimerization (inversion of stereochemistry at its alpha-carbon) during a reaction step.\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   Because they have different properties, they **can be separated** by standard LC, explaining the two peaks.\n    *   Because they are chemically distinct, their NMR spectra are different, explaining why a single proton can give rise to two distinct signals.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the experimental data.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the sample contains two species that have the same mass but different physical and chemical properties, allowing them to be separated by LC and distinguished by NMR. This is the definition of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most likely explanation for the given observations.\n\n### Analysis of the Experimental Evidence\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   **Observation:** The LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). Critically, both of these peaks yield the exact same mass spectrum, and this mass is consistent with the expected molecular weight of the target peptide.\n*   **Conclusion:** This is the most definitive piece of evidence. It proves that the two different species in the sample are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Elimination:** This fact immediately rules out explanations involving impurities that have a different chemical formula.\n    *   **Ruled out: B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor.** A precursor would have a different (likely lower) molecular weight.\n    *   **Ruled out: D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction.** This side reaction would create a product with a different (likely higher) molecular weight.\n\n**2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Liquid Chromatography (LC) Data:**\n*   **Observation:** The crude compound gives two distinct peaks in both the ¹H NMR spectrum (for the same proton) and the LC trace. The peak intensities are roughly equal in both analyses.\n*   **Conclusion:** This indicates that the two isomers present in the sample are physically and chemically distinct.\n    *   The two separate LC peaks mean the isomers have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, shape), which allows for their separation on a standard chromatography column.\n    *   The two separate NMR signals mean the alpha-proton exists in a different chemical environment in each isomer, making them distinguishable by NMR.\n\n### Evaluation of the Remaining Options\n\nWe are left with two possibilities for the isomeric mixture: enantiomers or diastereoisomers.\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they possess identical physical and chemical properties.\n    *   As a result, they would **not** separate into two peaks on a standard LC column and would **not** produce two distinct NMR signals for the same proton. They would appear as a single peak in both analyses.\n    *   This explanation is in direct contradiction to the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This is a common situation in molecules with multiple stereocenters, like peptides, where a synthesis step might partially invert the stereochemistry at one (but not all) of the chiral centers (a process called epimerization).\n    *   Diastereoisomers have **different physical and chemical properties**.\n    *   This difference in properties perfectly explains all the observations:\n        *   They are separable by standard LC, accounting for the two peaks in the chromatogram.\n        *   They are chemically distinct, leading to different NMR spectra and explaining why a single proton gives two signals.\n        *   As isomers, they have the same mass, consistent with the MS data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe combined experimental data—two species that have the same mass (isomers), but are separable by standard LC and distinguishable by standard NMR—is the classic analytical signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers. This is the only option that fits all the facts.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most likely explanation for the observations.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\nThis is the most critical piece of evidence.\n*   **Observation**: The LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC), but both peaks yield the **exact same mass spectrum**. This mass is also consistent with the expected product molecule.\n*   **Interpretation**: This proves that the two species in the sample are **isomers**. They have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Elimination**: This finding immediately rules out any explanation that involves a compound with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Option B (Double coupling)** is incorrect because this side reaction would produce a molecule with a higher mass.\n    *   **Option C (Contamination with a precursor)** is incorrect because a precursor from an earlier synthetic step would almost certainly have a different, likely lower, mass.\n\n### 2. Analyze the NMR and Chromatography Data to Distinguish Isomers\nWith options B and C eliminated, the mixture must be composed of isomers. The remaining options are enantiomers (D) or diastereoisomers (A). The NMR and LC data allow us to distinguish between these.\n\n*   **Observation**: The sample separates into two distinct peaks in the standard liquid chromatography (LC) and shows two distinct signals for a single proton in the standard ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **Interpretation**: These results show that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct. They have different physical properties (which allows for their separation by LC) and their atoms exist in different chemical environments (which causes them to have different signals in the NMR spectrum).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Types\n\n*   **Option D (Mixture of enantiomers)**: Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have **identical** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   Therefore, they **cannot** be separated by standard LC (they would produce a single peak).\n    *   They are also **indistinguishable** by standard NMR (they would produce a single set of signals).\n    *   This explanation is directly contradicted by both the LC and NMR data.\n\n*   **Option A (Mixture of diastereoisomers)**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. A common example in peptide synthesis is the accidental inversion of a single chiral center (epimerization), which creates a diastereomer of the intended peptide.\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties, even in an achiral environment.\n    *   This explains why they can be **separated by standard LC**, producing two peaks.\n    *   This also explains why they produce **different NMR spectra**, as the protons are in distinct chemical environments.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all pieces of experimental evidence: isomers (same mass) that are separable and distinguishable by standard analytical methods.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined analytical data—two species that have the same mass but are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR—is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Observation**: The LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). Critically, the mass spectrum (MS) for *both* peaks is identical and consistent with the mass of the expected product.\n*   **Interpretation**: This is the most definitive piece of evidence. It proves that the two chemical species present in the sample are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in the 3D arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Elimination**: This fact immediately rules out any explanation that involves a product with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Eliminate (B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**: A precursor is an unreacted starting material or an intermediate, which would have a different (usually lower) molecular weight.\n    *   **Eliminate (C) 'Double coupling' has occurred**: This describes a side reaction that adds an extra molecular group (like another amino acid), which would result in a product with a different (higher) molecular weight.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data to Identify the Isomer Type**\n\nHaving established the sample is a mixture of isomers, we must now determine what kind of isomers they are using the remaining data. The two main possibilities for stereoisomers are enantiomers and diastereoisomers.\n\n*   **Observation**: The sample separates into two distinct peaks in both the ¹H NMR spectrum (for the alpha-proton) and the liquid chromatogram (LC).\n*   **Interpretation**: This indicates that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct. They have different physical properties (which allows for their separation by LC) and their protons exist in different chemical environments (which causes them to have different signals in the NMR spectrum).\n*   **Evaluation of Remaining Options**:\n    *   **(A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they possess identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they are **indistinguishable** by standard NMR and are **inseparable** by standard LC; they would produce only a single peak in each experiment. This directly contradicts the observation of two distinct peaks.\n    *   **(D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have **different physical and chemical properties**, even in an achiral environment. This explains all the observations perfectly:\n        *   Because they have the same formula, they have the **same mass** (consistent with MS).\n        *   Because they have different physical properties, they **can be separated by standard LC** (consistent with two LC peaks).\n        *   Because they are chemically distinct, their corresponding protons have different electronic environments, causing them to produce **different signals in an NMR spectrum** (consistent with two NMR peaks).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combined analytical data—the presence of two species that are isomers (same mass), but are separable by standard chromatography and distinguishable by standard NMR—is the classic and unambiguous signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers. This is a common occurrence in peptide synthesis, often caused by epimerization at a chiral center or the presence of stable cis/trans amide bond isomers (rotamers).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a synthesis of the provided reasoning.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data.**\nThis is the most critical piece of evidence. The problem states that the LC-MS analysis yields two peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC), but both peaks have the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the expected product molecule.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** This proves that the two species in the sample are **isomers**. They have the same chemical formula and the same molecular weight.\n*   **Elimination:** This fact immediately rules out any option that would result in a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Option B (precursor contamination):** A precursor is an intermediate or starting material and would have a different, typically lower, mass. This is incorrect.\n    *   **Option C ('double coupling'):** This side reaction would add an extra chemical group, resulting in a product with a different, higher, mass. This is incorrect.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Liquid Chromatography (LC) Data.**\nWe are now left to distinguish between the two remaining types of isomers: enantiomers (Option A) and diastereoisomers (Option D).\n\n*   **Observation:** The compound gives two distinct peaks in the ¹H NMR spectrum (for the same proton) and two distinct, separable peaks in the LC analysis.\n*   **Interpretation:** This means the two isomers present in the sample have different physical and chemical properties, allowing them to be separated by chromatography and distinguished by NMR spectroscopy in a standard (achiral) environment.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Options.**\n\n*   **Option A (Mixture of enantiomers):** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment (like a standard LC column or a standard NMR solvent). Therefore, they would produce only a **single peak** in a standard LC analysis and a **single, identical set of signals** in a standard NMR spectrum. This is in direct contradiction to the observed data. Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This is a common occurrence in peptide synthesis, for example, if an amino acid with L-chirality partially converts to D-chirality during the synthesis (epimerization).\n    *   **Consistency:** Because diastereoisomers have **different physical and chemical properties**, they can be separated by standard LC (explaining the two LC peaks) and will produce distinct NMR spectra (explaining the two signals for the alpha-proton). As isomers, they have the same mass (consistent with the MS data).\n    *   This explanation perfectly accounts for all experimental observations.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe collective evidence—two species with the same mass (isomers), which are separable by standard chromatography and distinguishable by standard NMR—is the classic analytical signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning provided by the candidate answers and identifying the most critical points.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Observation**: The LC-MS analysis reveals two distinct peaks in the chromatogram (LC). Critically, the mass spectrum (MS) for *both* peaks is identical and corresponds to the mass of the expected product.\n*   **Careful Point**: This is the most definitive piece of evidence. It establishes that the two species present in the mixture are **isomers**—molecules with the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight, but different spatial arrangements of atoms.\n*   **Elimination**: This fact immediately rules out any explanation involving impurities with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Ruled out**: **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor.** A precursor from a previous synthetic step would have a different, likely lower, molecular weight.\n    *   **Ruled out**: **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction.** This side reaction would create a product with an extra molecular fragment, resulting in a higher molecular weight.\n\n**2. Analysis of the NMR and LC Data to Differentiate Isomers**\n\nHaving established the mixture consists of two isomers, we must now distinguish between the remaining possibilities: enantiomers (Option A) and diastereoisomers (Option C).\n\n*   **Observations**:\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct signals for a single proton, indicating it exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   The Liquid Chromatography (LC) physically separates the mixture into two distinct peaks, meaning the two components have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, shape).\n*   **Careful Point**: The key question is whether these observations are consistent with enantiomers or diastereoisomers. Standard NMR and LC instruments use achiral environments.\n\n*   **Evaluating Enantiomers (Option A)**:\n    *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   Therefore, they are indistinguishable by standard NMR (they would give a single, combined signal) and are not separable by a standard LC column (they would elute together as a single peak).\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is in direct contradiction to both the NMR and LC data. Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Evaluating Diastereoisomers (Option C)**:\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. A common example in peptide synthesis is the accidental inversion (epimerization) of a single chiral center, creating a mixture (e.g., an L,L-dipeptide and its D,L-diastereomer).\n    *   Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties, even in an achiral environment.\n    *   This perfectly explains all observations:\n        *   They are isomers, consistent with the MS data (same mass).\n        *   They have different physical properties, consistent with their separation into two peaks by LC.\n        *   They are chemically distinct, consistent with the alpha-proton having a different chemical shift in each, resulting in two NMR signals.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is the only explanation that fits all experimental evidence.\n\n**Final Summary**\n\nThe evidence points to a single, unambiguous conclusion. The crude compound contains a mixture of two species that (1) are isomers of each other, confirmed by MS, and (2) have different physical and chemical properties, confirmed by LC and NMR. By definition, stereoisomers that are not enantiomers are diastereomers.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided experimental evidence.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   **Observation:** The LC-MS analysis reveals two separate peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). Critically, both of these peaks produce the exact same mass spectrum (MS), and this mass is consistent with the expected product molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** This is the most powerful piece of evidence.

Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **Evaluation of Option C (Diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. A common example in peptide synthesis is the epimerization of a chiral center (e.g., one L-amino acid inverts to a D-amino acid). Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties even in an achiral environment.\n    *   **NMR Consistency:** Because they are chemically distinct molecules, their corresponding protons exist in different electronic environments and are expected to produce different NMR spectra.

Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Options**\n*   **Option (D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have **identical** physical and chemical properties in a standard (achiral) environment.\n    *   Therefore, enantiomers are **not separable by standard LC** and are **indistinguishable by standard NMR**. They would appear as a single peak in both techniques.\n    *   This contradicts the experimental data, so option (D) is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option (A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images.\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   This difference in properties explains why they can be **separated by standard LC** and why they produce **distinct NMR spectra**.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the experimental evidence. Such a mixture is common in peptide synthesis, often due to epimerization (the inversion of a single stereocenter) or the presence of stable cis/trans rotamers around a peptide bond, which are also a form of diastereoisomers.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe collective evidence—the presence of two isomers (confirmed by MS) that are separable and distinguishable by standard chromatographic and spectroscopic methods (LC and NMR)—unambiguously points to a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, considering all careful points from the evidence provided.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\n\nThis is the most critical starting point as it provides the most definitive information.\n*   **Observation**: The LC-MS analysis shows two separate peaks in the chromatogram (LC). However, the mass spectrum (MS) for *both* peaks is identical and matches the mass of the expected molecule.\n*   **Careful Point**: The identity of the mass for both peaks proves they are **isomers**. Isomers are molecules that have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in the arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Conclusion**: This observation immediately rules out any explanation involving impurities with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Eliminates Option A ('Double coupling')**: This side reaction would create a product with a *higher* molecular weight. This contradicts the MS data.\n    *   **Eliminates Option C (Contamination with a precursor)**: A precursor would be a starting material or intermediate and would have a *different* (usually lower) molecular weight. This also contradicts the MS data.\n\n### Step 2: Differentiate Between the Remaining Isomer Types\n\nAfter Step 1, we are left with two possibilities for the isomeric mixture: enantiomers (Option B) or diastereoisomers (Option D). To distinguish between these, we must analyze the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **Observation from NMR and LC**:\n    1.  The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct signals for a single alpha-proton.\n    2.  The LC separates the sample into two distinct peaks.\n*   **Careful Point**: These observations indicate that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct. They can be separated by a standard chromatography column, and they give different signals in a standard NMR experiment. This means they must have different properties in a standard (achiral) environment.\n\n*   **Evaluating Option B (Mixture of Enantiomers)**:\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they possess **identical** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   Because they are identical in this context, they are **indistinguishable** by standard ¹H NMR (they would produce a single signal set) and **inseparable** by standard LC (they would elute as a single peak).\n    *   **Conclusion**: This option is in direct contradiction to both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **Evaluating Option D (Mixture of Diastereoisomers)**:\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. (A common example in peptide synthesis is the epimerization of a chiral center, for instance, a peptide containing L-Alanine and L-Leucine could partially convert to D-Alanine and L-Leucine; these two molecules, L-Ala-L-Leu and D-Ala-L-Leu, would be diastereomers).\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties in all environments (both chiral and achiral).\n    *   **Consistency with Data**:\n        *   Their different physical properties explain why they separate into two peaks on an LC column.\n        *   Their different chemical properties and 3D structures explain why their NMR spectra are different, resulting in two distinct peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   Their status as isomers explains why they have the same mass.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This explanation is perfectly consistent with every piece of experimental data provided.\n\n### Final Summary\n\nThe combination of observing two species that (1) have the same mass, (2) are separable by standard chromatography, and (3) are distinguishable by standard NMR spectroscopy is the definitive analytical signature for a mixture of **diastereoisomers**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe goal is to determine the most likely identity of a synthetic peptide sample based on ¹H NMR and LC-MS data. Let's break down the evidence systematically.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** The LC-MS analysis reveals two distinct peaks in the chromatogram, but both peaks yield the *exact same mass spectrum*. Furthermore, this mass corresponds to the expected mass of the target peptide molecule.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is the most critical piece of evidence. It definitively proves that the two species present in the sample are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in their three-dimensional arrangement.\n    *   **Elimination:** This fact immediately rules out any explanation involving a different molecular formula or mass.\n        *   **Option A ('Double coupling'):** This side reaction would create a product with a higher mass. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n        *   **Option C (Contamination with a precursor):** A precursor from an earlier synthetic step would have a different (usually lower) mass. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data to Identify the Isomer Type:**\n    *   With options A and C eliminated, we are left to decide between a mixture of enantiomers (D) or diastereoisomers (B).\n    *   **Observation:** The two isomers are separable by standard Liquid Chromatography (LC) and distinguishable by ¹H NMR spectroscopy (a single proton gives rise to two distinct signals).\n    *   **Evaluation of Option D (Enantiomers):** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   On a standard LC column, enantiomers are not separated and would elute together as a single peak.\n        *   In a standard NMR spectrometer (using an achiral solvent), enantiomers are indistinguishable and would produce a single, identical set of signals.\n        *   Since the experimental data shows two separate peaks in both LC and NMR, the mixture cannot be composed of enantiomers.\n    *   **Evaluation of Option B (Diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. A common example in peptide synthesis is the accidental inversion (epimerization) of one of the chiral centers, leading to a mix of, for example, L-L and L-D peptides.\n        *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n        *   Because they have different properties, they are readily separable by standard LC, which explains the two observed peaks in the chromatogram.\n        *   Because they are chemically distinct molecules, their corresponding protons exist in different electronic environments, which explains why a single alpha-proton would produce two different signals in the NMR spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combined experimental evidence leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion. The sample consists of two species that are isomers (same mass) but are not enantiomers (they are separable and distinguishable by standard analytical methods). By definition, these must be diastereoisomers. This explanation is fully consistent with all provided data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of the provided analytical data (<sup>1</sup>H NMR and LC-MS) to deduce the nature of the crude compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\nThe most critical piece of evidence comes from the mass spectrometer.\n*   **Observation**: The LC separates the sample into two peaks, but both peaks give the **exact same mass spectrum**. Furthermore, this mass is consistent with the **expected product molecule**.\n*   **Interpretation**: This proves that the two species in the sample are **isomers**. They have the same chemical formula and therefore the same molecular weight, but they differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Elimination**: This fact immediately rules out any options that would result in a product with a different molecular weight:\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred...**: This would create a product with a higher mass than expected. This is incorrect.\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**: A precursor from an earlier synthetic step would have a different (usually lower) mass. This is incorrect.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the NMR and Chromatography (LC) Data**\nNow that we have established the two species are isomers, we must distinguish between the remaining possibilities: enantiomers and diastereoisomers.\n*   **Observations**:\n    1.  The <sup>1</sup>H NMR shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    2.  The LC trace shows two clearly separated peaks.\n*   **Interpretation**: These observations show that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct entities. They can be separated by chromatography (meaning they have different physical properties like polarity) and are distinguishable by NMR (meaning a proton within each has a different chemical environment).\n*   **Evaluating the remaining options**:\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have **identical** physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they **cannot be separated** by standard LC (they would elute as a single peak) and are **indistinguishable** by standard NMR (they would produce a single set of signals). This explanation is in direct contradiction to both the LC and NMR data. This is incorrect.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images. They have **different** physical and chemical properties in all environments. This means they are expected to have different NMR spectra and are separable by standard LC. This explanation is perfectly consistent with all observations: two isomers with the same mass that can be separated and have distinct chemical signatures in an NMR spectrum. This is a common phenomenon in peptide synthesis, often caused by the partial inversion of a chiral center (epimerization) or by stable cis/trans isomers around a peptide bond (rotamers).\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe collective evidence points to a single, unambiguous conclusion: the crude compound is a mixture of two diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**: The most critical piece of evidence is from the LC-MS. The analysis shows two separate peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC), but both peaks produce the *exact same mass spectrum*. Furthermore, this mass spectrum is consistent with the expected product.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This definitively proves that the two species in the sample are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in their 3D atomic arrangement.\n    *   **Elimination**: This fact immediately rules out any explanation involving impurities with a different molecular weight.\n        *   Option (C) **\"contaminated with a precursor\"** is incorrect because a precursor would have a different (likely lower) mass.\n        *   Option (D) **\"'Double coupling' has occurred\"** is incorrect because this side-reaction would create a product with a different (likely higher) mass.\n\n2.  **Analyze the NMR and Chromatography (LC) Data**: With only the isomer options remaining (A and B), we use the other data to distinguish between them.\n    *   **Observation**: The sample produces two distinct peaks in both the ¹H NMR (for the same proton) and the LC chromatogram.

A common example in peptide synthesis is epimerization, where an L-amino acid center inverts to a D-center, creating a diastereomeric pair (e.g., an L-L peptide vs. an L-D peptide). Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n        *   Their different properties allow them to be separated by standard LC, explaining the **two LC peaks**.\n        *   Their different chemical environments mean their nuclei will have different resonances in NMR, explaining the **two NMR peaks**.\n        *   As isomers, they have the same mass, consistent with the **MS data**.\n        *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all experimental evidence.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe combined data provides a classic analytical signature for a mixture of diastereoisomers. The two species have the same mass (are isomers) but can be separated and distinguished by standard chromatography and spectroscopy because they have different physical and chemical properties.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers, here is a consolidated step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data.**\nThe most critical piece of evidence is from the LC-MS analysis. It shows two separate peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace, but crucially, the mass spectrometry (MS) data reveals that *both peaks have the same mass spectrum*. Furthermore, this mass is consistent with the expected target molecule.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The two chemical species in the sample must be **isomers**—molecules with the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight, but with a different spatial arrangement of atoms.\n*   **Elimination:** This fact immediately rules out options that describe impurities with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor molecule would have a different (likely lower) mass. This is incorrect.\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This describes a side reaction that would create a product with a different (likely higher) mass. This is also incorrect.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Liquid Chromatography (LC) Data.**\nNow that we know the sample is a mixture of isomers, we must use the remaining data to distinguish between the two remaining possibilities: a mixture of enantiomers or a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n*   **Observations:**\n    1.  The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct signals for a single alpha-proton.\n    2.  The LC separates the sample into two distinct peaks.\n*   **Interpretation:** For two species to be distinguishable by standard NMR and separable by standard LC, they must have **different physical and chemical properties** in a standard (achiral) environment.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Options.**\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have **identical** physical and chemical properties in achiral environments.\n    *   Therefore, enantiomers would *not* separate on a standard LC column (they would give a single peak) and would *not* be distinguishable by a standard NMR spectrometer (they would produce a single, identical set of signals).\n    *   This is in direct contradiction to the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. A common example in peptide synthesis is epimerization, where one chiral center inverts (e.g., an L-amino acid becomes a D-amino acid in a peptide that has other L-amino acids).\n    *   Diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties. This means they will separate on a standard LC column and will have different NMR spectra.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all experimental observations: two isomers (same mass) that are separable and have distinct chemical signatures.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of observing two species that are isomers (same mass), but which can be separated by standard chromatography and distinguished by standard NMR, is the classic analytical signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided evidence.\n\n### **Analysis of Experimental Data**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Evidence:**\n    *   **Observation:** The LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the chromatogram (LC). Critically, both of these peaks produce the *exact same mass spectrum*, which is consistent with the mass of the expected peptide.\n    *   **Careful Point/Conclusion:** This is the most definitive piece of information. It proves that the two species in the mixture are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in their 3D arrangement. This single fact allows us to immediately rule out explanations that involve components with different molecular weights.\n\n2.  **Chromatography (LC) and NMR Evidence:**\n    *   **Observation:** The crude sample is separated into two distinct peaks of roughly equal intensity by liquid chromatography. Likewise, the ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks of roughly equal intensity for a single type of proton (the alpha-proton).\n    *   **Careful Point/Conclusion:** These observations show that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct from each other. They have different physical properties (which allows for separation by LC) and their protons exist in different chemical environments (which causes them to have different signals in the NMR spectrum).\n\n### **Evaluation of the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can now evaluate each option:\n\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction** and **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**: Both of these scenarios describe impurities that would have a different chemical formula and therefore a **different molecular weight** than the target peptide. The mass spectrometry data, which shows both components have the same, expected mass, directly contradicts these possibilities. Therefore, options B and C are incorrect.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. A key characteristic is that they have **identical** physical and chemical properties in a standard (achiral) environment.\n    *   This means they would **not** separate on a standard LC column (producing only one peak).\n    *   This also means they are **indistinguishable** in a standard NMR spectrum (producing only one set of signals).\n    *   Since the experimental data clearly shows two peaks in both the LC and NMR, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. This is a common phenomenon in peptide synthesis, often resulting from the epimerization (inversion of a chiral center) of one amino acid or from cis/trans isomerism around a peptide bond (forming rotamers).\n    *   As isomers, they have the **same mass**, which is consistent with the MS data.\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.

The problem states that the LC-MS analysis shows two clearly defined peaks, and importantly, **both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule.**\n\n*   **Interpretation:** This proves that the two species present in the sample are **isomers**. Isomers have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight, but a different spatial arrangement of atoms.\n*   **Elimination:** This fact allows us to immediately rule out any explanation that involves a product with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Option B (Double Coupling):** A \"double coupling\" side reaction would involve adding an extra chemical moiety (e.g., another amino acid), resulting in a product with a higher mass. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n    *   **Option C (Contaminated with Precursor):** A precursor from a previous synthetic step would have a different chemical formula and a different (usually lower) mass. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data to Distinguish Isomers**\n\nWe have established that the sample is a mixture of two isomers. The remaining options are a mixture of diastereoisomers (A) or enantiomers (D). We must use the other pieces of data to differentiate between them.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Observation:** A single alpha-proton appears as two separate peaks of equal integral.\n*   **LC Observation:** The two species are separable into two distinct peaks.\n*   **Interpretation:** These two observations show that the two isomers are distinguishable by standard analytical techniques.

This is a common situation in peptide synthesis, for instance, if one of the chiral amino acids undergoes epimerization (inversion of stereochemistry at its alpha-carbon) during a reaction step.\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   Because they have different properties, they **can be separated** by standard LC, explaining the two peaks.\n    *   Because they are chemically distinct, their NMR spectra are different, explaining why a single proton can give rise to two distinct signals.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the experimental data.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the sample contains two species that have the same mass but different physical and chemical properties, allowing them to be separated by LC and distinguished by NMR.

Critically, both of these peaks yield the exact same mass spectrum, and this mass is consistent with the expected molecular weight of the target peptide.\n*   **Conclusion:** This is the most definitive piece of evidence. It proves that the two different species in the sample are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Elimination:** This fact immediately rules out explanations involving impurities that have a different chemical formula.\n    *   **Ruled out: B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor.** A precursor would have a different (likely lower) molecular weight.\n    *   **Ruled out: D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction.** This side reaction would create a product with a different (likely higher) molecular weight.\n\n**2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Liquid Chromatography (LC) Data:**\n*   **Observation:** The crude compound gives two distinct peaks in both the ¹H NMR spectrum (for the same proton) and the LC trace. The peak intensities are roughly equal in both analyses.\n*   **Conclusion:** This indicates that the two isomers present in the sample are physically and chemically distinct.\n    *   The two separate LC peaks mean the isomers have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, shape), which allows for their separation on a standard chromatography column.\n    *   The two separate NMR signals mean the alpha-proton exists in a different chemical environment in each isomer, making them distinguishable by NMR.\n\n### Evaluation of the Remaining Options\n\nWe are left with two possibilities for the isomeric mixture: enantiomers or diastereoisomers.\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they possess identical physical and chemical properties.\n    *   As a result, they would **not** separate into two peaks on a standard LC column and would **not** produce two distinct NMR signals for the same proton. They would appear as a single peak in both analyses.\n    *   This explanation is in direct contradiction to the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This is a common situation in molecules with multiple stereocenters, like peptides, where a synthesis step might partially invert the stereochemistry at one (but not all) of the chiral centers (a process called epimerization).\n    *   Diastereoisomers have **different physical and chemical properties**.\n    *   This difference in properties perfectly explains all the observations:\n        *   They are separable by standard LC, accounting for the two peaks in the chromatogram.\n        *   They are chemically distinct, leading to different NMR spectra and explaining why a single proton gives two signals.\n        *   As isomers, they have the same mass, consistent with the MS data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe combined experimental data—two species that have the same mass (isomers), but are separable by standard LC and distinguishable by standard NMR—is the classic analytical signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers. This is the only option that fits all the facts.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most likely explanation for the observations.\n\n### 1.

Analyze the NMR and Chromatography Data to Distinguish Isomers\nWith options B and C eliminated, the mixture must be composed of isomers. The remaining options are enantiomers (D) or diastereoisomers (A). The NMR and LC data allow us to distinguish between these.\n\n*   **Observation**: The sample separates into two distinct peaks in the standard liquid chromatography (LC) and shows two distinct signals for a single proton in the standard ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **Interpretation**: These results show that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct. They have different physical properties (which allows for their separation by LC) and their atoms exist in different chemical environments (which causes them to have different signals in the NMR spectrum).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Types\n\n*   **Option D (Mixture of enantiomers)**: Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images.

A common example in peptide synthesis is the accidental inversion of a single chiral center (epimerization), which creates a diastereomer of the intended peptide.\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties, even in an achiral environment.\n    *   This explains why they can be **separated by standard LC**, producing two peaks.\n    *   This also explains why they produce **different NMR spectra**, as the protons are in distinct chemical environments.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all pieces of experimental evidence: isomers (same mass) that are separable and distinguishable by standard analytical methods.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined analytical data—two species that have the same mass but are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR—is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Observation**: The LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). Critically, the mass spectrum (MS) for *both* peaks is identical and consistent with the mass of the expected product.\n*   **Interpretation**: This is the most definitive piece of evidence. It proves that the two chemical species present in the sample are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in the 3D arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Elimination**: This fact immediately rules out any explanation that involves a product with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Eliminate (B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**: A precursor is an unreacted starting material or an intermediate, which would have a different (usually lower) molecular weight.\n    *   **Eliminate (C) 'Double coupling' has occurred**: This describes a side reaction that adds an extra molecular group (like another amino acid), which would result in a product with a different (higher) molecular weight.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data to Identify the Isomer Type**\n\nHaving established the sample is a mixture of isomers, we must now determine what kind of isomers they are using the remaining data. The two main possibilities for stereoisomers are enantiomers and diastereoisomers.\n\n*   **Observation**: The sample separates into two distinct peaks in both the ¹H NMR spectrum (for the alpha-proton) and the liquid chromatogram (LC).\n*   **Interpretation**: This indicates that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct. They have different physical properties (which allows for their separation by LC) and their protons exist in different chemical environments (which causes them to have different signals in the NMR spectrum).\n*   **Evaluation of Remaining Options**:\n    *   **(A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they possess identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they are **indistinguishable** by standard NMR and are **inseparable** by standard LC; they would produce only a single peak in each experiment. This directly contradicts the observation of two distinct peaks.\n    *   **(D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have **different physical and chemical properties**, even in an achiral environment. This explains all the observations perfectly:\n        *   Because they have the same formula, they have the **same mass** (consistent with MS).\n        *   Because they have different physical properties, they **can be separated by standard LC** (consistent with two LC peaks).\n        *   Because they are chemically distinct, their corresponding protons have different electronic environments, causing them to produce **different signals in an NMR spectrum** (consistent with two NMR peaks).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combined analytical data—the presence of two species that are isomers (same mass), but are separable by standard chromatography and distinguishable by standard NMR—is the classic and unambiguous signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers. This is a common occurrence in peptide synthesis, often caused by epimerization at a chiral center or the presence of stable cis/trans amide bond isomers (rotamers).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a synthesis of the provided reasoning.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data.**\nThis is the most critical piece of evidence. The problem states that the LC-MS analysis yields two peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC), but both peaks have the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the expected product molecule.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** This proves that the two species in the sample are **isomers**. They have the same chemical formula and the same molecular weight.\n*   **Elimination:** This fact immediately rules out any option that would result in a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Option B (precursor contamination):** A precursor is an intermediate or starting material and would have a different, typically lower, mass. This is incorrect.\n    *   **Option C ('double coupling'):** This side reaction would add an extra chemical group, resulting in a product with a different, higher, mass. This is incorrect.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Liquid Chromatography (LC) Data.**\nWe are now left to distinguish between the two remaining types of isomers: enantiomers (Option A) and diastereoisomers (Option D).\n\n*   **Observation:** The compound gives two distinct peaks in the ¹H NMR spectrum (for the same proton) and two distinct, separable peaks in the LC analysis.\n*   **Interpretation:** This means the two isomers present in the sample have different physical and chemical properties, allowing them to be separated by chromatography and distinguished by NMR spectroscopy in a standard (achiral) environment.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Options.**\n\n*   **Option A (Mixture of enantiomers):** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment (like a standard LC column or a standard NMR solvent). Therefore, they would produce only a **single peak** in a standard LC analysis and a **single, identical set of signals** in a standard NMR spectrum. This is in direct contradiction to the observed data. Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This is a common occurrence in peptide synthesis, for example, if an amino acid with L-chirality partially converts to D-chirality during the synthesis (epimerization).\n    *   **Consistency:** Because diastereoisomers have **different physical and chemical properties**, they can be separated by standard LC (explaining the two LC peaks) and will produce distinct NMR spectra (explaining the two signals for the alpha-proton). As isomers, they have the same mass (consistent with the MS data).\n    *   This explanation perfectly accounts for all experimental observations.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe collective evidence—two species with the same mass (isomers), which are separable by standard chromatography and distinguishable by standard NMR—is the classic analytical signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning provided by the candidate answers and identifying the most critical points.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Observation**: The LC-MS analysis reveals two distinct peaks in the chromatogram (LC). Critically, the mass spectrum (MS) for *both* peaks is identical and corresponds to the mass of the expected product.\n*   **Careful Point**: This is the most definitive piece of evidence. It establishes that the two species present in the mixture are **isomers**—molecules with the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight, but different spatial arrangements of atoms.\n*   **Elimination**: This fact immediately rules out any explanation involving impurities with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Ruled out**: **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor.** A precursor from a previous synthetic step would have a different, likely lower, molecular weight.\n    *   **Ruled out**: **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction.** This side reaction would create a product with an extra molecular fragment, resulting in a higher molecular weight.\n\n**2. Analysis of the NMR and LC Data to Differentiate Isomers**\n\nHaving established the mixture consists of two isomers, we must now distinguish between the remaining possibilities: enantiomers (Option A) and diastereoisomers (Option C).\n\n*   **Observations**:\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct signals for a single proton, indicating it exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   The Liquid Chromatography (LC) physically separates the mixture into two distinct peaks, meaning the two components have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, shape).\n*   **Careful Point**: The key question is whether these observations are consistent with enantiomers or diastereoisomers. Standard NMR and LC instruments use achiral environments.\n\n*   **Evaluating Enantiomers (Option A)**:\n    *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   Therefore, they are indistinguishable by standard NMR (they would give a single, combined signal) and are not separable by a standard LC column (they would elute together as a single peak).\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is in direct contradiction to both the NMR and LC data. Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Evaluating Diastereoisomers (Option C)**:\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. A common example in peptide synthesis is the accidental inversion (epimerization) of a single chiral center, creating a mixture (e.g., an L,L-dipeptide and its D,L-diastereomer).\n    *   Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties, even in an achiral environment.\n    *   This perfectly explains all observations:\n        *   They are isomers, consistent with the MS data (same mass).\n        *   They have different physical properties, consistent with their separation into two peaks by LC.\n        *   They are chemically distinct, consistent with the alpha-proton having a different chemical shift in each, resulting in two NMR signals.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is the only explanation that fits all experimental evidence.\n\n**Final Summary**\n\nThe evidence points to a single, unambiguous conclusion. The crude compound contains a mixture of two species that (1) are isomers of each other, confirmed by MS, and (2) have different physical and chemical properties, confirmed by LC and NMR. By definition, stereoisomers that are not enantiomers are diastereomers.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided experimental evidence.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   **Observation:** The LC-MS analysis reveals two separate peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). Critically, both of these peaks produce the exact same mass spectrum (MS), and this mass is consistent with the expected product molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** This is the most powerful piece of evidence. It proves that the two chemical species in the mixture are **isomers**. They have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight but differ only in their three-dimensional arrangement.\n*   **Elimination:** This fact immediately rules out any explanation involving impurities that have a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Option B ('Double coupling')** is incorrect because this side reaction would result in a product with a higher mass.\n    *   **Option D (Contamination with a precursor)** is incorrect because a precursor from an earlier synthetic step would have a different (usually lower) mass.\n\n**2. Analysis of the NMR and LC Data to Differentiate Isomers:**\nWe are now left to distinguish between the two remaining types of isomers: enantiomers (Option A) and diastereoisomers (Option C).\n\n*   **Observation:** The sample separates into two distinct peaks in both the ¹H NMR spectrum (for the alpha-proton) and the liquid chromatogram.\n*   **Evaluation of Option A (Enantiomers):** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they possess identical physical and chemical properties.\n    *   They are indistinguishable by a standard NMR spectrometer and would produce a single, combined set of signals.\n    *   They are not separable on a standard LC column and would elute as a single peak.\n    *   These predictions are in direct contradiction to the observation of two peaks in both the NMR and LC analyses. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **Evaluation of Option C (Diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. A common example in peptide synthesis is the epimerization of a chiral center (e.g., one L-amino acid inverts to a D-amino acid). Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties even in an achiral environment.\n    *   **NMR Consistency:** Because they are chemically distinct molecules, their corresponding protons exist in different electronic environments and are expected to produce different NMR spectra. This perfectly explains why the alpha-proton gives rise to two distinct signals.\n    *   **LC Consistency:** Because they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, shape), they can be separated by standard liquid chromatography. This perfectly explains the two observed peaks in the chromatogram.\n    *   This explanation is the only one that is fully consistent with all the experimental data provided.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe observation of two distinct chemical species that have the same mass (are isomers) but are separable by standard chromatography and distinguishable by standard NMR is the classic analytical signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
