A careful, step-by-step analysis of the clues reveals a single, highly consistent chemical pathway.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Clues and Find the Key**\n\nThe four clues provide a set of constraints to solve the puzzle. Clue 3 is the most chemically descriptive and offers the best starting point.\n\n*   **Clue 3:** `C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.`\n    *   This describes a hydrolysis reaction where a substance `C` disproportionates, meaning the element from `C` is both oxidized and reduced. The fact that the starting solid `A` is reformed is a crucial detail.\n    *   This pattern is characteristic of the hydrolysis of a sulfur halide. Let's test sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`):\n        `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(aq) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    *   This perfectly matches the clue:\n        *   **A = S** (Sulfur, a solid, is reformed). In its elemental form, it's `S₈`.\n        *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid).\n        *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid, formed from SO₂ in water, is a weak acid).\n    *   This leads to the strong hypothesis that **C = SCl₂**.\n\n**Step 2: Verify with Other Clues**\n\nNow we test this hypothesis against the other clues, especially the highly specific stoichiometry of Clue 1.\n\n*   **Clue 1:** `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n    *   With `A = S₈` and `C = SCl₂`, gas `B` must be Chlorine (`Cl₂`). Let's write the balanced equation:\n        `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`\n    *   This reaction shows that 1 mole (equivalent) of solid A (`S₈`) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (`Cl₂`). This is a perfect match. Additionally, `SCl₂` is a cherry-red liquid, which aligns with \"bright red product\".\n    *   This confirms our identities and identifies **B = Cl₂**.\n\n*   **Clue 4:** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    *   With `B = Cl₂`, the reaction is `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`.\n    *   A common gas-phase addition reaction fitting this is the chlorination of ethene:\n        `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    *   This identifies **D = C₂H₄** (ethene) and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane, a common solvent). This fits all conditions.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product E**\n\n*   **Clue 2:** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    *   Substituting our identified compounds: `SCl₂(l) + 2C₂H₄(g) → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process, the standard industrial synthesis of **mustard gas**:\n        `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`\n    *   This identifies **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**, or mustard gas. As a potent chemical warfare agent, it is undeniably \"extremely hazardous.\"\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\nThe final task is to find the point group of mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule is flexible due to single-bond rotation. Its lowest-energy conformation is not planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** Analysis of the stable structure shows it lacks any mirror planes (σ) or a center of inversion (i), making it a chiral molecule. The only non-trivial symmetry element it possesses is a single **two-fold rotational axis (C₂) ** that passes through the central sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C bond angle.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule whose only symmetry elements are the identity (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemical puzzle consistently leads to the identification of E as mustard gas. The molecular symmetry group for mustard gas is **C₂**. Matching this with the provided options:\n\nA) D4h\nB) D∞h\nC) C2\nD) C2v\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Puzzle and Identify Key Clues:** The problem is a chemical riddle that requires deducing the identities of several unknown substances (A-H) to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The clues are:\n    *   **Clue 1:** `A(s) + 8B(g) → C(bright red)`\n    *   **Clue 2:** `C + 2D(g) → E(extremely hazardous)`\n    *   **Clue 3:** `C + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`\n    *   **Clue 4:** `D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent)` (1:1 ratio)\n\n    Of these, Clue 3 (descriptive hydrolysis) and Clue 1 (unusual 1:8 stoichiometry) are the most powerful constraints.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Dominant Reasoning Path:** A vast majority of the candidate answers converge on a single, consistent chemical pathway that satisfies all clues. This pathway is the most logical and is detailed below.\n    *   **Starting with Clue 3:** The hydrolysis of `C` to regenerate `A` while forming a strong and a weak acid is characteristic of the disproportionation of a non-metal halide. The reaction `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(aq) + 4HCl(aq)` fits this perfectly. This suggests:\n        *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride)\n        *   **A = S** (Sulfur, which exists as solid S₈)\n        *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid)\n        *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid, a weak acid formed from SO₂ in water)\n\n    *   **Validating with Clue 1:** With the above identities, the reaction `A(s) + 8B(g) → C` becomes the formation of `SCl₂` from `S₈`. The balanced chemical equation is `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n        *   This shows that 1 equivalent of `A` (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 equivalents of `B` (Cl₂). This perfectly matches the 1:8 stoichiometry.\n        *   It also confirms **B = Cl₂** and that `C` (SCl₂) is a \"bright red\" (cherry-red) product.\n\n    *   **Validating with Clue 4:** With **B = Cl₂**, the reaction `D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio becomes `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`.\n        *   The chlorination of ethene, `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`, is a standard 1:1 reaction producing a common solvent (1,2-dichloroethane). This identifies **D = C₂H₄** and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂**.\n\n    *   **Identifying E with Clue 2:** The final step is `C + 2D(g) → E(extremely hazardous)`.\n        *   Substituting the known substances gives `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`. This is the well-known Levinstein process for manufacturing mustard gas.\n        *   Therefore, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**, bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, or mustard gas, which is undeniably \"extremely hazardous\".\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n    *   The molecule identified as E is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   To determine its molecular symmetry group (point group), we analyze the symmetry elements of its most stable conformation.\n    *   The molecule has a bent C-S-C backbone and is flexible. It is not planar.\n    *   It is a chiral molecule, meaning it has no mirror planes (σ) and no center of inversion (i).\n    *   Its only non-trivial symmetry element is a single **two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) ** that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n    *   A molecule that contains only the identity element (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** The chemical reasoning consistently identifies product E as mustard gas, which has a C₂ point group. Reviewing the provided options:\n    A) C2v\n    B) C2\n    C) D4h\n    D) D∞h\n\nThe correct answer is C₂, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n**Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core of this problem is to deduce the identity of an extremely hazardous product, E, by logically solving a series of chemical reaction clues. Once E is identified, its molecular symmetry group (point group) must be determined.\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3: The Hydrolysis Reaction**\n    *   The clue states: `C + H₂O → A(reformed) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`.\n    *   This is the most chemically descriptive clue. The regeneration of a solid reactant (`A`) from its derivative (`C`) upon hydrolysis, along with the formation of two distinct acids, is a strong indicator of a disproportionation reaction.\n    *   A classic reaction that perfectly matches this description is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride, specifically sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`): `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + 4HCl(aq) + SO₂(g)`.\n    *   Matching this to the clue:\n        *   **A = Sulfur (S)**, a solid that is reformed. In its standard state, it exists as the **S₈** allotrope.\n        *   **C = Sulfur dichloride (SCl₂)**.\n        *   **F = Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)**, a well-known strong acid.\n        *   **G = Sulfurous Acid (H₂SO₃)**, which is the weak acid formed when the gaseous product `SO₂` dissolves in water.\n    *   This hypothesis provides a perfect match for all parts of Clue 3.\n\n2.  **Verify with Clue 1: The Formation of C**\n    *   The clue states: `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`.\n    *   Using the identities from Step 1 (`A = S₈` and `C = SCl₂`), gas `B` must be chlorine (`Cl₂`). The color of `SCl₂` is cherry-red, matching the \"bright red\" description.\n    *   Let's check the stoichiometry: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This balanced equation shows that 1 mole (equivalent) of solid `A` (the S₈ ring) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas `B` (`Cl₂`). This is a perfect match for the highly specific 1:8 ratio, strongly confirming our identifications.\n\n3.  **Verify with Clue 4: The Formation of H**\n    *   The clue states: `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`.\n    *   We identified `B` as `Cl₂`. The reaction is `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`.\n    *   A standard gas-phase addition reaction fitting this is the chlorination of ethylene (`C₂H₄`) to produce 1,2-dichloroethane (`C₂H₄Cl₂`), a common solvent: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This identifies **D = Ethylene (C₂H₄)** and **H = 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂)**.\n\n4.  **Identify E with Clue 2: The Final Product**\n    *   The clue states: `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`.\n    *   Substituting our known identities: `SCl₂(l) + 2C₂H₄(g) → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process, the standard industrial method for synthesizing **mustard gas**: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   Thus, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**. Mustard gas is an infamous chemical warfare agent, which perfectly matches the description \"extremely hazardous\". The 1:2 stoichiometry also matches the clue.\n\n**5. Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E (Mustard Gas)**\n\nThe final task is to find the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E.\n*   **Molecule**: E is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n*   **Structure**: The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. The molecule is flexible due to single bond rotation.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**: To assign a point group, we consider the molecule's most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n    *   It does **not** have a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i). Therefore, it is chiral.\n    *   It **does** have a single **two-fold rotational axis (C₂)** that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n*   **Conclusion**: A molecule whose only symmetry elements are the identity (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**Final Answer Selection**\nThe deduced point group is **C₂**. Matching this result to the provided options:\nA) D∞h\nB) C2v\nC) D4h\nD) C2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step chemical deduction based on four reaction clues to identify substance E and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3:** `C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.`\n    This is the most descriptive clue. The regeneration of solid A and the formation of two distinct acids (one strong, one weak) from a single compound C is characteristic of the disproportionation of a non-metal halide upon hydrolysis. A textbook example is the reaction of a sulfur chloride.\n    Let's test the hypothesis with sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`):\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(aq) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    This perfectly matches the description:\n    *   **A = Sulfur (S)**, a solid that is reformed. Its stable solid allotrope is `S₈`.\n    *   **F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)**, a strong acid.\n    *   **G = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)**, a weak acid formed from `SO₂` dissolving in water.\n    *   This strongly suggests that **C = SCl₂**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1:** `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n    Let's use the identities found in Step 1: `A = S₈` and `C = SCl₂`. `SCl₂` is described as a cherry-red liquid, which is consistent with \"bright red product\". To form a chloride compound from elemental sulfur, gas `B` must be chlorine (`Cl₂`). Now we check the stoichiometry:\n    `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`\n    This balanced equation shows that 1 mole (or one \"equivalent\") of `A` (the S₈ molecule) reacts with exactly 8 moles (\"equivalents\") of `B` (`Cl₂`). This is a perfect match for the specific stoichiometry given in the clue, strongly validating our path. This confirms **B = Cl₂**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 4:** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    Using `B = Cl₂`, the clue becomes: `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`. A very common gas-phase reaction that fits this 1:1 ratio and produces a solvent is the chlorination of ethene:\n    `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    This identifies **D = C₂H₄ (ethene)** and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**, a common solvent.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2:** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    Now we can find `E` by substituting the identities we've deduced: `C = SCl₂` and `D = C₂H₄`.\n    `SCl₂(l) + 2C₂H₄(g) → E`\n    This is the well-known **Levinstein process** for synthesizing **mustard gas**. The reaction is:\n    `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`\n    This identifies **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (mustard gas)**. Mustard gas is an infamous chemical warfare agent, perfectly matching the description \"extremely hazardous.\"\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E (Mustard Gas)**\n    The final step is to find the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E.\n    *   **Structure:** Mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`, has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. The molecule is flexible due to single bond rotation and is not planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:** In its lowest energy conformation, the molecule is chiral, meaning it has no mirror planes (σ) or a center of inversion (i). Its only non-identity symmetry element is a single **two-fold rotational axis (C₂) ** that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n    *   **Point Group:** A molecule whose only symmetry elements are the identity (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the options:\nA) C2\nB) D4h\nC) C2v\nD) D∞h\n\nThe correct answer is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analysis of Key Clues**\n\nThe most effective way to solve this riddle is to start with the most specific and chemically descriptive clues.\n\n*   **Clue 3:** `C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.` This clue is the most powerful starting point. The regeneration of a solid starting material (A) from its derivative (C) upon hydrolysis, along with the production of two distinct acids, strongly indicates a disproportionation reaction. A textbook example is the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + 4HCl(aq) + SO₂(g)`\n    This perfectly matches the description:\n    *   **A = Sulfur (S)**, a solid, which is reformed.\n    *   **F = Hydrochloric acid (HCl)**, a strong acid.\n    *   **G = Sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃)**, which forms when the gaseous product `SO₂` dissolves in water, and it is a weak acid.\n    *   This establishes a very strong hypothesis: **C = SCl₂**.\n\n*   **Clue 1:** `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.` This clue, with its unusual stoichiometry, serves as a powerful check on our hypothesis.\n    *   With `A = Sulfur` (which exists as the stable allotrope S₈) and `C = SCl₂` (a cherry-red liquid, fitting \"bright red\"), we can deduce `B` must be chlorine gas (`Cl₂`).\n    *   The balanced reaction is: **`S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`**.\n    *   This equation shows that 1 equivalent of the `S₈` molecule reacts with exactly 8 equivalents of `Cl₂` molecules. This is a perfect match for the clue's 1:8 ratio and strongly confirms the identities of A, B, and C.\n\n**2. Identification of the Remaining Substances**\n\nWith A, B, and C identified, the remaining substances can be found.\n\n*   **Clue 4:** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    *   We know `B = Cl₂`. The reaction is `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio. A very common industrial reaction that fits this description is the addition of chlorine to ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This identifies **D = C₂H₄ (ethene)** and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**, a common solvent.\n\n*   **Clue 2:** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    *   Substituting the known identities: `SCl₂(l) + 2C₂H₄(g) → E`.\n    *   This is the well-documented Levinstein process, the standard synthesis for **mustard gas**: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   This identifies **E = Mustard Gas**. As a notorious chemical warfare agent, it perfectly fits the description \"extremely hazardous.\"\n\n**3. Determination of the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\nThe final step is to find the molecular symmetry group (point group) of the product E, mustard gas.\n\n*   **Molecule:** E = `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂` (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide).\n*   **Structure and Conformation:** The molecule is not planar or linear. Due to the lone pairs on the sulfur atom, it has a bent C-S-C core. The chloroethyl arms are flexible due to free rotation around the single bonds. To assign a point group, we consider the most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** The lowest-energy conformations of mustard gas are chiral (meaning they have a non-superimposable mirror image). They do not possess any mirror planes (σ) or a center of inversion (i). The only non-trivial symmetry element present is a single **two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) ** that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule whose only symmetry elements are the identity (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe step-by-step chemical deduction leads unambiguously to the conclusion that product E is mustard gas, which has a molecular symmetry of **C₂**. Matching this result with the provided options:\n\nA) D∞h\nB) C₂\nC) D₄h\nD) C₂v\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires deducing the identities of substances A through H to ultimately determine the molecular symmetry group of substance E. The most effective approach is to systematically solve for the unknowns using the clues provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Start with the most descriptive clue (Clue 3):**\n    `C + H₂O → A(reformed) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`\n    This describes the hydrolysis of a substance `C`, which results in the reformation of solid `A` alongside both a strong and a weak acid. This is a hallmark of a disproportionation reaction, a well-known characteristic of certain non-metal halides.\n    A textbook example that fits this description perfectly is the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`):\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + 4HCl(aq) + SO₂(g)`\n    Let's check this reaction against the clue:\n    *   **A**: Elemental Sulfur (`S`) is a solid that is reformed. This fits. The stable solid allotrope is **S₈**.\n    *   **F**: Hydrochloric acid (`HCl`) is a strong acid. This fits.\n    *   **G**: Sulfur dioxide (`SO₂`) dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (`H₂SO₃`), a weak acid. This fits.\n    *   This strongly suggests that **C = SCl₂**.\n\n2.  **Verify with the specific stoichiometry of Clue 1:**\n    `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n    Let's plug in our identified substances: A = `S₈` and C = `SCl₂`. `SCl₂` is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches \"bright red\". The reaction to form `SCl₂` from `S₈` would require chlorine gas (`Cl₂`) as reactant B. Let's check the balanced equation:\n    **`S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`**\n    This reaction shows that 1 equivalent of solid A (`S₈`) reacts with exactly 8 equivalents of gas B (`Cl₂`). This is a perfect match for the specific 1:8 ratio in the clue, strongly validating this entire chemical pathway. Thus, **B = Cl₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Clue 4:**\n    `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    We now know B = `Cl₂`. The clue describes the reaction `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`. A very common gas-phase addition reaction that produces a solvent is the chlorination of ethene:\n    `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    This reaction is 1:1 and produces 1,2-dichloroethane, a common solvent. This fits perfectly. Therefore, **D = C₂H₄** and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify the final product E with Clue 2:**\n    `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    Substituting our known compounds:\n    `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`\n    This is the well-known Levinstein process, the primary industrial synthesis for **mustard gas**:\n    `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`\n    Therefore, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**, or mustard gas. This substance is an infamous chemical warfare agent and certainly qualifies as \"extremely hazardous\". The 1:2 stoichiometry also matches the clue perfectly.\n\n### Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E\n\nThe final step is to determine the point group (molecular symmetry group) of E, which is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule is not planar or linear.

F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.` The regeneration of the solid starting material `A` along with the formation of two distinct acids is a classic sign of a disproportionation reaction upon hydrolysis. This is very characteristic of certain non-metal halides.\n\n2.  **Form a Hypothesis**: A well-known reaction that fits Clue 3 is the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n    `2 SCl₂ + 2 H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(aq) + 4 HCl(aq)`\n    Let's check this against the clue's requirements:\n    *   **A**: Elemental sulfur (`S`) is a solid, and it is reformed. This fits.\n    *   **F**: Hydrochloric acid (`HCl`) is a strong acid. This fits.\n    *   **G**: Sulfur dioxide (`SO₂`) dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (`H₂SO₃`), which is a weak acid. This fits.\n    *   This makes a very strong case for identifying **C = SCl₂** and **A = S**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Clue 1**: This clue, `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`, has a very specific stoichiometric requirement.\n    *   Using our hypothesis: A = Sulfur (whose stable solid allotrope is S₈), and C = SCl₂ (which is a cherry-red liquid, fitting \"bright red\"). The gas `B` required to make a chloride from an element must be chlorine, `Cl₂`.\n    *   Let's check the balanced chemical equation: `S₈(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → 8 SCl₂(l)`\n    *   This reaction shows that 1 equivalent of solid `A` (the S₈ molecule) reacts with exactly **8 equivalents** of gas `B` (Cl₂). This perfect match to the 1:8 ratio strongly confirms our hypothesis and identifies **B = Cl₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Clue 4**: This clue is `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`.\n    *   Using our identified `B = Cl₂`, the reaction is `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`.\n    *   A standard industrial reaction fitting this description is the addition of chlorine gas to ethene gas: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This identifies **D = C₂H₄** (ethene) and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane), a common solvent. This fits perfectly.\n\n5.  **Identify Product E with Clue 2**: This clue states `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`.\n    *   Plugging in our now-identified substances: `SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process, the primary method for synthesizing **mustard gas**. The reaction is `SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   Thus, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**.

The fact that the starting solid `A` is reformed, along with the formation of both a strong and a weak acid, is a hallmark of a disproportionation reaction. A textbook example is the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + 4HCl(aq) + SO₂(g)`\n    This perfectly matches the description:\n    *   **A**: Sulfur (S) is a solid, which is reformed. The stable allotrope is `S₈`.\n    *   **C**: Sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`). It is a cherry-red liquid, which fits the description \"bright red product\".\n    *   **F**: Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid.\n    *   **G**: Sulfur dioxide (SO₂) dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), which is a weak acid.\n    This pathway is chemically sound and fits all parts of the clue.\n\n2.  **Validate with Clue 1: Stoichiometry.**\n    The clue is `A(s) + 8B(g) → C`. Let's use the identities found above (`A = S₈`, `C = SCl₂`). To form SCl₂ from sulfur, gas B must be chlorine (`Cl₂`). Let's check the stoichiometry:\n    `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`\n    This reaction shows that 1 equivalent of the `S₈` molecule reacts with exactly 8 equivalents of `Cl₂` gas. This is a perfect and non-obvious match for the unusual 1:8 ratio, strongly confirming our identifications.\n    *   **B**: Chlorine (`Cl₂`).\n\n3.  **Validate with Clue 4: Solvent Formation.**\n    The clue is `D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio. Substituting `B = Cl₂`:\n    `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`\n    A very common gas-phase addition reaction that produces a solvent is the chlorination of ethene:\n    `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    *   **D**: Ethene (`C₂H₄`).\n    *   **H**: 1,2-dichloroethane (`C₂H₄Cl₂`), a widely used solvent.\n    This also fits perfectly.\n\n4.  **Identify E with Clue 2.**\n    The clue is `C + 2D(g) → E(extremely hazardous)`. Substituting our knowns:\n    `SCl₂(l) + 2C₂H₄(g) → E`\n    This is the well-known Levinstein process, the standard industrial synthesis for **mustard gas**: `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   **E**: Mustard gas, bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide. This infamous chemical warfare agent perfectly fits the \"extremely hazardous\" description.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E.**\n    The final step is to find the point group of E (mustard gas), `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule is not planar or linear. It has a central sulfur atom, two lone pairs, and two flexible chloroethyl groups.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:** To assign a point group, we consider the molecule's most stable, lowest-energy conformation. This conformation is chiral, meaning it has no mirror planes (σ) and no center of inversion (i). Its only non-identity symmetry element is a single **two-fold rotational axis (C₂) ** that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n    *   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical pathway is consistent across all clues, leading to the identification of E as mustard gas. The molecular symmetry group of mustard gas is **C₂**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core of this problem is to deduce the chemical identity of an \"extremely hazardous product E\" by logically connecting a series of four clues, and then to determine its molecular symmetry group. The most effective method is to find the most chemically specific clues to build a hypothesis and then test that hypothesis against the other clues.\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3: The Hydrolysis Reaction**\n    *   **Clue:** `C + H₂O → A(reformed) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is the most descriptive clue. The regeneration of the starting solid `A` upon hydrolysis of `C`, along with the production of two different acids (one strong, one weak), strongly points to a disproportionation reaction. This is a characteristic reaction of certain non-metal halides.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** A classic example is the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n        `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    *   **Checking the Hypothesis:**\n        *   **A = S** (Sulfur): It is a solid, and it is \"reformed\". This fits.\n        *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid): This is a strong acid. This fits.\n        *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid, from SO₂ dissolved in water): This is a weak acid. This fits.\n        *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride): This is our proposed identity for `C`.\n\n2.  **Verify with Clue 1: Stoichiometry and Color**\n    *   **Clue:** `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n    *   **Reasoning:** We test our hypothesis (`A=S`, `C=SCl₂`). The stable solid form of sulfur is the `S₈` allotrope. To form `SCl₂` from `S`, the gas `B` must be `Cl₂`. Sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) is a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red\" description.\n    *   **Checking Stoichiometry:** The balanced equation is `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This equation shows that **1 mole of solid A (S₈)** reacts with exactly **8 moles of gas B (Cl₂) **. This is a perfect match for the highly specific 1:8 stoichiometry given in the clue, strongly confirming our initial hypothesis.\n    *   **Confirmation:** **A=S₈**, **B=Cl₂**, **C=SCl₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Clue 4: Solvent Formation**\n    *   **Clue:** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    *   **Reasoning:** We know `B = Cl₂`. The reaction is `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** A common 1:1 gas-phase addition reaction is the chlorination of ethene to form 1,2-dichloroethane: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   **Checking the Hypothesis:** Ethene (`D=C₂H₄`) is a gas, and 1,2-dichloroethane (`H=C₂H₄Cl₂`) is a common solvent. This fits all parts of the clue.\n    *   **Confirmation:** **D=C₂H₄**, **H=C₂H₄Cl₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify E with Clue 2: The Final Product**\n    *   **Clue:** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    *   **Reasoning:** We substitute our confirmed identities: `C=SCl₂`, `D=C₂H₄`.\n    *   The reaction is `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   **Result:** This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of **mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**. The 1:2 stoichiometry is correct, and mustard gas is infamous for being \"extremely hazardous\".\n    *   **Confirmation:** **E = Mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**.\n\n**Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\n1.  **Molecule:** E is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n2.  **Structure:** The molecule is not planar or linear. It has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups, resulting in a bent `C-S-C` backbone due to the sulfur's lone electron pairs.\n3.  **Symmetry Elements:** We consider the molecule's most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n    *   It does **not** have any mirror planes (σ) or a center of inversion (i). The molecule is chiral.\n    *   It possesses a single **two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) **. This axis passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the angle between the two chloroethyl arms.\n4.  **Point Group:** A molecule whose only symmetry element besides the identity (E) is a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical pathway identifying E as mustard gas is the only one that fully and consistently satisfies every clue in the puzzle.

This fits.\n        *   **G**: Sulfur dioxide (SO₂) is a gas that dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), which is a weak acid. This fits.\n    *   From this, we deduce: **A = Sulfur (S₈)** and **C = Sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) **.\n\n2.  **Verify with Clue 1: Stoichiometry of Formation.**\n    *   The clue states: `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`.\n    *   Using the identities from Step 1 (`A = S₈`, `C = SCl₂`), we can identify gas `B`. The formation of SCl₂ from its elements requires chlorine gas (`Cl₂`). The color of SCl₂ is cherry-red, fitting the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   The balanced reaction is: **`S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`**.\n    *   This reaction shows that 1 equivalent of solid `A` (the S₈ molecule) reacts with exactly 8 equivalents of gas `B` (`Cl₂`).

The most effective way to solve it is to identify the most descriptive clue and use it as a starting point.\n\n*   **Clue 3:** `C + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)` is the most informative clue. The fact that solid `A` is reformed from substance `C` upon reaction with water, along with the production of two distinct acids, is a strong indicator of a disproportionation reaction. This is a characteristic reaction of certain non-metal halides.\n*   A classic chemical reaction that fits this description perfectly is the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n    `2 SCl₂ + 2 H₂O → S(s) + 4 HCl(aq) + SO₂(g)`\n    Let's check if this matches the clue:\n    *   **A**: Solid sulfur (`S`) is reformed. (The stable form of elemental sulfur is S₈). This fits.\n    *   **F**: `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid. This fits.\n    *   **G**: `SO₂` gas dissolves in water to form `H₂SO₃` (sulfurous acid), which is a weak acid. This fits.\n    *   From this single clue, we can strongly hypothesize that: `A = Sulfur (S₈)`, `C = Sulfur dichloride (SCl₂)`, `F = HCl`, and `G = H₂SO₃`.\n\n**2. Verification with Other Clues**\n\nNow, we must verify this hypothesis using the remaining clues.\n\n*   **Clue 1:** `A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(bright red)`.\n    *   Using our identities: `S₈(s) + 8 B(g) → 8 SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This equation is perfectly balanced if `B` is chlorine gas (`Cl₂`). The molar ratio is 1 mole of S₈ to 8 moles of Cl₂. This matches the highly specific **\"1 to 8 equivalents\"** ratio flawlessly. Furthermore, `SCl₂` is a cherry-red liquid, which fits the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   This step confirms our hypothesis and identifies `B = Cl₂`.\n\n*   **Clue 4:** `D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Using our identity `B = Cl₂`, the reaction becomes: `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(l)`.\n    *   A common 1:1 gas-phase reaction that produces a well-known solvent is the addition of chlorine to ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This fits perfectly and allows us to identify: `D = Ethene (C₂H₄)` and `H = 1,2-dichloroethane`.\n\n*   **Clue 2:** `C + 2 D(g) → E(extremely hazardous)`.\n    *   Let's substitute our final unknown identities: `SCl₂(l) + 2 C₂H₄(g) → E`.\n    *   This is the well-documented Levinstein process, the standard industrial synthesis of **mustard gas**: `SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   This identifies `E` as mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`. Mustard gas is an infamous chemical warfare agent, fitting the description \"extremely hazardous\" perfectly. The 1:2 stoichiometry also matches.\n\n**3. Determination of the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\nHaving successfully identified all the compounds, the final task is to determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E, mustard gas.\n\n*   **Molecule:** Mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n*   **Structure:** It has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. Due to lone pairs on the sulfur, the C-S-C backbone is bent. The molecule is flexible and not planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** In its most stable, lowest-energy conformation, the molecule is chiral (lacks mirror planes and a center of inversion).

The most reliable way to solve this is to find a single, consistent chemical pathway that satisfies all the given clues.\n\n**Step-by-Step Deduction**\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3: The Hydrolysis Reaction**\n    *   **Clue**: `C + H₂O → A(reformed) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`\n    *   **Analysis**: This is the most informative clue. A single compound (C) reacting with water to reform its elemental solid component (A) while also producing two different acids is highly characteristic of the disproportionation of a non-metal halide. The textbook example is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride.\n    *   **Hypothesis**: Let's test the reaction of sulfur dichloride: `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(aq) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    *   **Matching**:\n        *   **A** = `Sulfur (S)`, a solid that is reformed.\n        *   **F** = `Hydrochloric acid (HCl)`, a strong acid.\n        *   **G** = `Sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃)` (formed from `SO₂` in water), a weak acid.\n        *   This hypothesis fits perfectly, suggesting that **C = SCl₂**.\n\n2.  **Verify with Clue 1: The Formation of C**\n    *   **Clue**: `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n    *   **Analysis**: We test our identities: A = Sulfur (whose stable solid allotrope is the ring `S₈`), and C = `SCl₂`. To form `SCl₂`, gas B must be chlorine (`Cl₂`). Sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red\" description.\n    *   **Stoichiometry Check**: The balanced reaction is `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This reaction shows that 1 mole (equivalent) of solid A (`S₈`) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (`Cl₂`). This is a perfect match for the specific and unusual 1:8 ratio, strongly confirming our identifications. **B = Cl₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Clue 4: The Solvent Formation**\n    *   **Clue**: `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    *   **Analysis**: We know `B = Cl₂`. The reaction is `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio. A very common industrial reaction that fits this description is the addition of chlorine gas to ethene gas.\n    *   **Reaction**: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    *   **Conclusion**: This identifies **D = C₂H₄** (ethene) and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane, a common solvent). This also fits perfectly.\n\n4.  **Identify E with Clue 2: The Final Product**\n    *   **Clue**: `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    *   **Analysis**: Substituting our confirmed identities: `SCl₂(l) + 2C₂H₄(g) → E`.\n    *   **Reaction**: This is the well-documented Levinstein process, the standard industrial synthesis of **mustard gas**: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Product **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂** (mustard gas). As an infamous chemical warfare agent, it undeniably qualifies as \"extremely hazardous\". The 1:2 stoichiometry is also correct.\n\n**Final Step: Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\n*   **Molecule**: Mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n*   **Structure**: The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two flexible chloroethyl groups. The molecule is not planar or linear.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**: To assign a point group, we consider its most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n    *   It does **not** have any mirror planes (`σ`) or a center of inversion (`i`). Therefore, it is a chiral molecule.\n    *   Its only non-trivial symmetry element is a single **two-fold rotational axis (C₂)**. This axis passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle, relating one arm of the molecule to the other.\n*   **Point Group**: A molecule whose only symmetry elements are the identity (`E`) and a single `C₂` axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nMatching our result with the provided options:\nA) D∞h\nB) D4h\nC) C2\nD) C2v\n\nThe correct answer is C₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Analysis of the Reasoning\n\nThe core of this problem is to deduce the identity of a series of chemical compounds based on reaction clues, and from there, determine the symmetry of the final product, E. A thorough review of the provided candidate answers reveals a highly consistent and chemically sound logical path.\n\n**1. Unlocking the Puzzle with Key Clues:**\n\n*   **Clue 3:** `C + H₂O → A(reformed) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`. This is the most descriptive clue. The regeneration of a solid reactant `A` alongside two different acids (one strong, one weak) points strongly to the hydrolysis and disproportionation of a non-metal halide. The candidate answers correctly identify this as a classic reaction of a sulfur chloride. Specifically, the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n    `2 SCl₂ + 2 H₂O → S(s) + 4 HCl(aq) + SO₂(g)`\n    This perfectly identifies:\n    *   **A**: Sulfur (S), a solid that is reformed.\n    *   **C**: Sulfur Dichloride (SCl₂), which is a cherry-red liquid (\"bright red product\").\n    *   **F**: Hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid.\n    *   **G**: Sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid formed from SO₂ in water.\n\n*   **Clue 1:** `A(s) + 8B(g) → C(bright red)`. This clue provides a crucial stoichiometric check.\n    *   Using the identities from Clue 3, where `A` is Sulfur (whose stable solid allotrope is the S₈ ring) and `C` is SCl₂, the reaction requires chlorine gas (`Cl₂`) as reactant `B`.\n    *   The balanced reaction is: `S₈(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → 8 SCl₂(l)`\n    *   This equation shows that **1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles of gas B (Cl₂) **. This perfect match for the \"8 equivalents\" clue strongly confirms this line of reasoning.\n\n**2. Completing the Identification:**\n\n*   **Clue 4:** `D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent)` (1:1 ratio).\n    *   With `B` identified as `Cl₂`, the reaction becomes `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`.\n    *   A common gas-phase addition reaction fitting this description is the chlorination of ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This identifies **D** as Ethene (`C₂H₄`) and **H** as 1,2-dichloroethane, a common solvent.\n\n*   **Clue 2:** `C + 2D(g) → E(extremely hazardous)`.\n    *   Substituting the known identities: `SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process, the standard industrial synthesis for **mustard gas**.\n    *   Therefore, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**. Mustard gas is an infamous chemical warfare agent and perfectly fits the \"extremely hazardous\" description.\n\n**3. Determining the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n\nThe final step is to determine the point group (molecular symmetry group) for the identified product E, mustard gas.\n\n*   **Molecule**: `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`\n*   **Structure**: The molecule has a central sulfur atom, making the C-S-C backbone bent. It is a flexible molecule due to rotation around single bonds.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**: When considering the molecule's most stable, lowest-energy conformation, we find it lacks any high symmetry. It does not have any mirror planes (σ) or a center of inversion (i). The only symmetry element present (other than the identity) is a single **two-fold rotational axis (C₂)** that passes through the sulfur atom and relates the two chloroethyl arms to each other.\n*   **Point Group**: A molecule whose only symmetry elements are the identity (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe step-by-step chemical deduction is robust and internally consistent, unambiguously identifying E as mustard gas. The molecular symmetry group of mustard gas is **C₂**.

It points to a disproportionation reaction. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) fits perfectly: `2 SCl₂ + 2 H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(aq) + 4 HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This identifies **A = Sulfur (S)**, a solid that is reformed.\n    *   It identifies **C = Sulfur dichloride (SCl₂)**.\n    *   It identifies **F = Hydrochloric acid (HCl)**, a strong acid.\n    *   It identifies **G = Sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃)**, a weak acid formed from dissolved `SO₂`.\n\n2.  **The Stoichiometry Clue (Clue 1)**: The reaction `A(s) + 8B(g) → C(bright red)` is used to verify the identities. Sulfur's stable solid allotrope is `S₈`. The product `SCl₂` is cherry-red.\n    *   The reaction is `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This perfectly matches the 1:8 ratio of A:B, thus confirming **B = Chlorine (Cl₂)**. This unique stoichiometry is a key confirmation of this chemical pathway.\n\n3.  **The Solvent Clue (Clue 4)**: The reaction `D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   With `B = Cl₂`, this becomes `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`. A classic example is the chlorination of ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This identifies **D = Ethene (C₂H₄)** and **H = 1,2-dichloroethane**, a common solvent.\n\n4.  **The Hazardous Product Clue (Clue 2)**: The reaction `C + 2D(g) → E(extremely hazardous)`.\n    *   Substituting the known identities: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process, which synthesizes **mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**. Mustard gas is a chemical warfare agent and is extremely hazardous.\n\n### Determination of Molecular Symmetry\n\n*   The product **E** is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n*   The molecule consists of a central sulfur atom with two chloroethyl arms. The molecule is not planar or linear and exists in various conformations.\n*   The most stable conformation is chiral, meaning it has no mirror planes (`σ`) or a center of inversion (`i`).\n*   Its only symmetry element (other than the identity element) is a single **two-fold rotational axis (C₂) **that passes through the sulfur atom.\n*   A molecule belonging to a group with only the identity (E) and a C₂ axis has the point group **C₂**.\n\n### Final Answer Selection\n\nThe deduced molecular symmetry group for product E (mustard gas) is **C₂**.

Clue 3 is the most chemically descriptive and offers the best starting point.\n\n*   **Clue 3:** `C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.`\n    *   This describes a hydrolysis reaction where a substance `C` disproportionates, meaning the element from `C` is both oxidized and reduced. The fact that the starting solid `A` is reformed is a crucial detail.\n    *   This pattern is characteristic of the hydrolysis of a sulfur halide. Let's test sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`):\n        `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(aq) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    *   This perfectly matches the clue:\n        *   **A = S** (Sulfur, a solid, is reformed).

This pathway is the most logical and is detailed below.\n    *   **Starting with Clue 3:** The hydrolysis of `C` to regenerate `A` while forming a strong and a weak acid is characteristic of the disproportionation of a non-metal halide. The reaction `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(aq) + 4HCl(aq)` fits this perfectly.

The balanced chemical equation is `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n        *   This shows that 1 equivalent of `A` (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 equivalents of `B` (Cl₂). This perfectly matches the 1:8 stoichiometry.\n        *   It also confirms **B = Cl₂** and that `C` (SCl₂) is a \"bright red\" (cherry-red) product.\n\n    *   **Validating with Clue 4:** With **B = Cl₂**, the reaction `D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio becomes `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`.\n        *   The chlorination of ethene, `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`, is a standard 1:1 reaction producing a common solvent (1,2-dichloroethane). This identifies **D = C₂H₄** and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂**.\n\n    *   **Identifying E with Clue 2:** The final step is `C + 2D(g) → E(extremely hazardous)`.\n        *   Substituting the known substances gives `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`. This is the well-known Levinstein process for manufacturing mustard gas.\n        *   Therefore, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**, bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, or mustard gas, which is undeniably \"extremely hazardous\".\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n    *   The molecule identified as E is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   To determine its molecular symmetry group (point group), we analyze the symmetry elements of its most stable conformation.\n    *   The molecule has a bent C-S-C backbone and is flexible.

F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.`\n    This is the most descriptive clue. The regeneration of solid A and the formation of two distinct acids (one strong, one weak) from a single compound C is characteristic of the disproportionation of a non-metal halide upon hydrolysis. A textbook example is the reaction of a sulfur chloride.\n    Let's test the hypothesis with sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`):\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(aq) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    This perfectly matches the description:\n    *   **A = Sulfur (S)**, a solid that is reformed. Its stable solid allotrope is `S₈`.\n    *   **F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)**, a strong acid.\n    *   **G = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)**, a weak acid formed from `SO₂` dissolving in water.\n    *   This strongly suggests that **C = SCl₂**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1:** `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n    Let's use the identities found in Step 1: `A = S₈` and `C = SCl₂`. `SCl₂` is described as a cherry-red liquid, which is consistent with \"bright red product\". To form a chloride compound from elemental sulfur, gas `B` must be chlorine (`Cl₂`). Now we check the stoichiometry:\n    `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`\n    This balanced equation shows that 1 mole (or one \"equivalent\") of `A` (the S₈ molecule) reacts with exactly 8 moles (\"equivalents\") of `B` (`Cl₂`). This is a perfect match for the specific stoichiometry given in the clue, strongly validating our path. This confirms **B = Cl₂**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 4:** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    Using `B = Cl₂`, the clue becomes: `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`. A very common gas-phase reaction that fits this 1:1 ratio and produces a solvent is the chlorination of ethene:\n    `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    This identifies **D = C₂H₄ (ethene)** and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**, a common solvent.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2:** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    Now we can find `E` by substituting the identities we've deduced: `C = SCl₂` and `D = C₂H₄`.\n    `SCl₂(l) + 2C₂H₄(g) → E`\n    This is the well-known **Levinstein process** for synthesizing **mustard gas**. The reaction is:\n    `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`\n    This identifies **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (mustard gas)**. Mustard gas is an infamous chemical warfare agent, perfectly matching the description \"extremely hazardous.\"\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E (Mustard Gas)**\n    The final step is to find the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E.\n    *   **Structure:** Mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`, has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. The molecule is flexible due to single bond rotation and is not planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:** In its lowest energy conformation, the molecule is chiral, meaning it has no mirror planes (σ) or a center of inversion (i). Its only non-identity symmetry element is a single **two-fold rotational axis (C₂) ** that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n    *   **Point Group:** A molecule whose only symmetry elements are the identity (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the options:\nA) C2\nB) D4h\nC) C2v\nD) D∞h\n\nThe correct answer is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analysis of Key Clues**\n\nThe most effective way to solve this riddle is to start with the most specific and chemically descriptive clues.\n\n*   **Clue 3:** `C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.` This clue is the most powerful starting point. The regeneration of a solid starting material (A) from its derivative (C) upon hydrolysis, along with the production of two distinct acids, strongly indicates a disproportionation reaction. A textbook example is the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + 4HCl(aq) + SO₂(g)`\n    This perfectly matches the description:\n    *   **A = Sulfur (S)**, a solid, which is reformed.\n    *   **F = Hydrochloric acid (HCl)**, a strong acid.\n    *   **G = Sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃)**, which forms when the gaseous product `SO₂` dissolves in water, and it is a weak acid.\n    *   This establishes a very strong hypothesis: **C = SCl₂**.\n\n*   **Clue 1:** `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.` This clue, with its unusual stoichiometry, serves as a powerful check on our hypothesis.\n    *   With `A = Sulfur` (which exists as the stable allotrope S₈) and `C = SCl₂` (a cherry-red liquid, fitting \"bright red\"), we can deduce `B` must be chlorine gas (`Cl₂`).\n    *   The balanced reaction is: **`S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`**.\n    *   This equation shows that 1 equivalent of the `S₈` molecule reacts with exactly 8 equivalents of `Cl₂` molecules. This is a perfect match for the clue's 1:8 ratio and strongly confirms the identities of A, B, and C.\n\n**2. Identification of the Remaining Substances**\n\nWith A, B, and C identified, the remaining substances can be found.\n\n*   **Clue 4:** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    *   We know `B = Cl₂`. The reaction is `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio. A very common industrial reaction that fits this description is the addition of chlorine to ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This identifies **D = C₂H₄ (ethene)** and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**, a common solvent.\n\n*   **Clue 2:** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    *   Substituting the known identities: `SCl₂(l) + 2C₂H₄(g) → E`.\n    *   This is the well-documented Levinstein process, the standard synthesis for **mustard gas**: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   This identifies **E = Mustard Gas**. As a notorious chemical warfare agent, it perfectly fits the description \"extremely hazardous.\"\n\n**3. Determination of the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\nThe final step is to find the molecular symmetry group (point group) of the product E, mustard gas.\n\n*   **Molecule:** E = `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂` (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide).\n*   **Structure and Conformation:** The molecule is not planar or linear. Due to the lone pairs on the sulfur atom, it has a bent C-S-C core. The chloroethyl arms are flexible due to free rotation around the single bonds. To assign a point group, we consider the most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** The lowest-energy conformations of mustard gas are chiral (meaning they have a non-superimposable mirror image). They do not possess any mirror planes (σ) or a center of inversion (i). The only non-trivial symmetry element present is a single **two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) ** that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule whose only symmetry elements are the identity (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**4.

The most effective approach is to systematically solve for the unknowns using the clues provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Start with the most descriptive clue (Clue 3):**\n    `C + H₂O → A(reformed) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`\n    This describes the hydrolysis of a substance `C`, which results in the reformation of solid `A` alongside both a strong and a weak acid. This is a hallmark of a disproportionation reaction, a well-known characteristic of certain non-metal halides.\n    A textbook example that fits this description perfectly is the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`):\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + 4HCl(aq) + SO₂(g)`\n    Let's check this reaction against the clue:\n    *   **A**: Elemental Sulfur (`S`) is a solid that is reformed. This fits. The stable solid allotrope is **S₈**.\n    *   **F**: Hydrochloric acid (`HCl`) is a strong acid. This fits.\n    *   **G**: Sulfur dioxide (`SO₂`) dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (`H₂SO₃`), a weak acid. This fits.\n    *   This strongly suggests that **C = SCl₂**.\n\n2.  **Verify with the specific stoichiometry of Clue 1:**\n    `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n    Let's plug in our identified substances: A = `S₈` and C = `SCl₂`. `SCl₂` is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches \"bright red\". The reaction to form `SCl₂` from `S₈` would require chlorine gas (`Cl₂`) as reactant B. Let's check the balanced equation:\n    **`S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`**\n    This reaction shows that 1 equivalent of solid A (`S₈`) reacts with exactly 8 equivalents of gas B (`Cl₂`). This is a perfect match for the specific 1:8 ratio in the clue, strongly validating this entire chemical pathway. Thus, **B = Cl₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Clue 4:**\n    `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    We now know B = `Cl₂`. The clue describes the reaction `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`. A very common gas-phase addition reaction that produces a solvent is the chlorination of ethene:\n    `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    This reaction is 1:1 and produces 1,2-dichloroethane, a common solvent. This fits perfectly. Therefore, **D = C₂H₄** and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify the final product E with Clue 2:**\n    `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    Substituting our known compounds:\n    `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`\n    This is the well-known Levinstein process, the primary industrial synthesis for **mustard gas**:\n    `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`\n    Therefore, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**, or mustard gas. This substance is an infamous chemical warfare agent and certainly qualifies as \"extremely hazardous\". The 1:2 stoichiometry also matches the clue perfectly.\n\n### Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E\n\nThe final step is to determine the point group (molecular symmetry group) of E, which is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule is not planar or linear. It has a central sulfur atom with a bent `C-S-C` backbone due to two lone pairs on the sulfur.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** Due to rotation around single bonds, the molecule is flexible. In its most stable, lowest-energy conformation, the molecule is chiral, meaning it lacks any mirror planes (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n*   Its only symmetry element (other than the identity, E) is a single **two-fold rotational axis (C₂)**. This axis passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle, rotating one chloroethyl arm into the position of the other.\n*   A molecule that has only the identity element and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) C2\nB) D4h\nC) C2v\nD) D∞h\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Clue**: The most chemically informative clue is Clue 3: `C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.` The regeneration of the solid starting material `A` along with the formation of two distinct acids is a classic sign of a disproportionation reaction upon hydrolysis. This is very characteristic of certain non-metal halides.\n\n2.  **Form a Hypothesis**: A well-known reaction that fits Clue 3 is the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n    `2 SCl₂ + 2 H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(aq) + 4 HCl(aq)`\n    Let's check this against the clue's requirements:\n    *   **A**: Elemental sulfur (`S`) is a solid, and it is reformed. This fits.\n    *   **F**: Hydrochloric acid (`HCl`) is a strong acid. This fits.\n    *   **G**: Sulfur dioxide (`SO₂`) dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (`H₂SO₃`), which is a weak acid. This fits.\n    *   This makes a very strong case for identifying **C = SCl₂** and **A = S**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Clue 1**: This clue, `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`, has a very specific stoichiometric requirement.\n    *   Using our hypothesis: A = Sulfur (whose stable solid allotrope is S₈), and C = SCl₂ (which is a cherry-red liquid, fitting \"bright red\"). The gas `B` required to make a chloride from an element must be chlorine, `Cl₂`.\n    *   Let's check the balanced chemical equation: `S₈(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → 8 SCl₂(l)`\n    *   This reaction shows that 1 equivalent of solid `A` (the S₈ molecule) reacts with exactly **8 equivalents** of gas `B` (Cl₂). This perfect match to the 1:8 ratio strongly confirms our hypothesis and identifies **B = Cl₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Clue 4**: This clue is `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`.\n    *   Using our identified `B = Cl₂`, the reaction is `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`.\n    *   A standard industrial reaction fitting this description is the addition of chlorine gas to ethene gas: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This identifies **D = C₂H₄** (ethene) and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane), a common solvent. This fits perfectly.\n\n5.  **Identify Product E with Clue 2**: This clue states `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`.\n    *   Plugging in our now-identified substances: `SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process, the primary method for synthesizing **mustard gas**. The reaction is `SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   Thus, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**.

The fact that the starting solid `A` is reformed, along with the formation of both a strong and a weak acid, is a hallmark of a disproportionation reaction. A textbook example is the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + 4HCl(aq) + SO₂(g)`\n    This perfectly matches the description:\n    *   **A**: Sulfur (S) is a solid, which is reformed. The stable allotrope is `S₈`.\n    *   **C**: Sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`). It is a cherry-red liquid, which fits the description \"bright red product\".\n    *   **F**: Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid.\n    *   **G**: Sulfur dioxide (SO₂) dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), which is a weak acid.\n    This pathway is chemically sound and fits all parts of the clue.\n\n2.  **Validate with Clue 1: Stoichiometry.**\n    The clue is `A(s) + 8B(g) → C`. Let's use the identities found above (`A = S₈`, `C = SCl₂`). To form SCl₂ from sulfur, gas B must be chlorine (`Cl₂`). Let's check the stoichiometry:\n    `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`\n    This reaction shows that 1 equivalent of the `S₈` molecule reacts with exactly 8 equivalents of `Cl₂` gas. This is a perfect and non-obvious match for the unusual 1:8 ratio, strongly confirming our identifications.\n    *   **B**: Chlorine (`Cl₂`).\n\n3.  **Validate with Clue 4: Solvent Formation.**\n    The clue is `D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio. Substituting `B = Cl₂`:\n    `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`\n    A very common gas-phase addition reaction that produces a solvent is the chlorination of ethene:\n    `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    *   **D**: Ethene (`C₂H₄`).\n    *   **H**: 1,2-dichloroethane (`C₂H₄Cl₂`), a widely used solvent.\n    This also fits perfectly.\n\n4.  **Identify E with Clue 2.**\n    The clue is `C + 2D(g) → E(extremely hazardous)`. Substituting our knowns:\n    `SCl₂(l) + 2C₂H₄(g) → E`\n    This is the well-known Levinstein process, the standard industrial synthesis for **mustard gas**: `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   **E**: Mustard gas, bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide. This infamous chemical warfare agent perfectly fits the \"extremely hazardous\" description.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E.**\n    The final step is to find the point group of E (mustard gas), `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule is not planar or linear. It has a central sulfur atom, two lone pairs, and two flexible chloroethyl groups.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:** To assign a point group, we consider the molecule's most stable, lowest-energy conformation. This conformation is chiral, meaning it has no mirror planes (σ) and no center of inversion (i).

The molecular symmetry group of mustard gas is **C₂**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core of this problem is to deduce the chemical identity of an \"extremely hazardous product E\" by logically connecting a series of four clues, and then to determine its molecular symmetry group. The most effective method is to find the most chemically specific clues to build a hypothesis and then test that hypothesis against the other clues.\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3: The Hydrolysis Reaction**\n    *   **Clue:** `C + H₂O → A(reformed) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is the most descriptive clue. The regeneration of the starting solid `A` upon hydrolysis of `C`, along with the production of two different acids (one strong, one weak), strongly points to a disproportionation reaction. This is a characteristic reaction of certain non-metal halides.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** A classic example is the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n        `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    *   **Checking the Hypothesis:**\n        *   **A = S** (Sulfur): It is a solid, and it is \"reformed\". This fits.\n        *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid): This is a strong acid. This fits.\n        *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid, from SO₂ dissolved in water): This is a weak acid. This fits.\n        *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride): This is our proposed identity for `C`.\n\n2.  **Verify with Clue 1: Stoichiometry and Color**\n    *   **Clue:** `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n    *   **Reasoning:** We test our hypothesis (`A=S`, `C=SCl₂`). The stable solid form of sulfur is the `S₈` allotrope. To form `SCl₂` from `S`, the gas `B` must be `Cl₂`. Sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) is a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red\" description.\n    *   **Checking Stoichiometry:** The balanced equation is `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This equation shows that **1 mole of solid A (S₈)** reacts with exactly **8 moles of gas B (Cl₂) **.

Analysis of the Clues**\n\nThe puzzle provides four chemical reaction clues. The most effective way to solve it is to identify the most descriptive clue and use it as a starting point.\n\n*   **Clue 3:** `C + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)` is the most informative clue. The fact that solid `A` is reformed from substance `C` upon reaction with water, along with the production of two distinct acids, is a strong indicator of a disproportionation reaction. This is a characteristic reaction of certain non-metal halides.\n*   A classic chemical reaction that fits this description perfectly is the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n    `2 SCl₂ + 2 H₂O → S(s) + 4 HCl(aq) + SO₂(g)`\n    Let's check if this matches the clue:\n    *   **A**: Solid sulfur (`S`) is reformed. (The stable form of elemental sulfur is S₈). This fits.\n    *   **F**: `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid. This fits.\n    *   **G**: `SO₂` gas dissolves in water to form `H₂SO₃` (sulfurous acid), which is a weak acid. This fits.\n    *   From this single clue, we can strongly hypothesize that: `A = Sulfur (S₈)`, `C = Sulfur dichloride (SCl₂)`, `F = HCl`, and `G = H₂SO₃`.\n\n**2. Verification with Other Clues**\n\nNow, we must verify this hypothesis using the remaining clues.\n\n*   **Clue 1:** `A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(bright red)`.\n    *   Using our identities: `S₈(s) + 8 B(g) → 8 SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This equation is perfectly balanced if `B` is chlorine gas (`Cl₂`). The molar ratio is 1 mole of S₈ to 8 moles of Cl₂. This matches the highly specific **\"1 to 8 equivalents\"** ratio flawlessly. Furthermore, `SCl₂` is a cherry-red liquid, which fits the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   This step confirms our hypothesis and identifies `B = Cl₂`.\n\n*   **Clue 4:** `D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Using our identity `B = Cl₂`, the reaction becomes: `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(l)`.\n    *   A common 1:1 gas-phase reaction that produces a well-known solvent is the addition of chlorine to ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This fits perfectly and allows us to identify: `D = Ethene (C₂H₄)` and `H = 1,2-dichloroethane`.\n\n*   **Clue 2:** `C + 2 D(g) → E(extremely hazardous)`.\n    *   Let's substitute our final unknown identities: `SCl₂(l) + 2 C₂H₄(g) → E`.\n    *   This is the well-documented Levinstein process, the standard industrial synthesis of **mustard gas**: `SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   This identifies `E` as mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`. Mustard gas is an infamous chemical warfare agent, fitting the description \"extremely hazardous\" perfectly. The 1:2 stoichiometry also matches.\n\n**3. Determination of the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\nHaving successfully identified all the compounds, the final task is to determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E, mustard gas.\n\n*   **Molecule:** Mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n*   **Structure:** It has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. Due to lone pairs on the sulfur, the C-S-C backbone is bent. The molecule is flexible and not planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** In its most stable, lowest-energy conformation, the molecule is chiral (lacks mirror planes and a center of inversion). Its only non-trivial symmetry element is a single **two-fold rotational axis (C₂) **. This axis passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the angle between the two chloroethyl groups.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single C₂ rotational axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**4.

The molecule is not planar or linear and exists in various conformations.\n*   The most stable conformation is chiral, meaning it has no mirror planes (`σ`) or a center of inversion (`i`).\n*   Its only symmetry element (other than the identity element) is a single **two-fold rotational axis (C₂) **that passes through the sulfur atom.\n*   A molecule belonging to a group with only the identity (E) and a C₂ axis has the point group **C₂**.\n\n### Final Answer Selection\n\nThe deduced molecular symmetry group for product E (mustard gas) is **C₂**. Comparing this result with the provided options:\nA) D4h\nB) C2\nC) D∞h\nD) C2v\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
