    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the primary species in the solution.**\n    The solution is prepared by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O) in water.\n    *   KH2PO4 dissociates completely to provide K+ ions and dihydrogen phosphate ions (H2PO4-).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely to provide Na+ ions and hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO4^2-).\n    *   Therefore, the solution contains a significant amount of the conjugate acid-base pair H2PO4- / HPO4^2-. This pair constitutes a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- (from KH2PO4):\n        *   Molar Mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n        *   Moles = mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n        *   Initial [H2PO4-] = moles / volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4●2H2O):\n        *   Molar Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n        *   Moles = mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n        *   Initial [HPO4^2-] = moles / volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer solution.**\n    The pH of the buffer is governed by the equilibrium involving the H2PO4- / HPO4^2- pair, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + HPO₄²⁻(aq)\n    *   Equilibrium constant: Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n    The expression for Ka₂ is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]. Since it's a buffer, we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations of the conjugate acid and base with their initial concentrations.\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * [H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M) / (0.02809 M)\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻).**\n    The orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This corresponds to the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + PO₄³⁻(aq)\n    *   Equilibrium constant: Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n    The expression for Ka₃ is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    We can rearrange this equation to solve for [PO₄³⁻]. We will use the [H⁺] calculated from the buffer and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] (since Ka₃ is very small, the amount of HPO₄²⁻ that dissociates is negligible).\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nTo ensure precision, let's use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values from the problem statement\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume\n\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium.\n# H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n# We assume the initial concentrations are the equilibrium concentrations for the buffer calculation.\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate concentration [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium.\n# HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# Rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-].\n# We assume [HPO4^2-] at this equilibrium is its initial concentration because Ka3 is very small.\nconc_PO4_3minus = (Ka3 * conc_HPO4_2minus) / H_plus_conc\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation to match the answer choices.\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in a solution containing dihydrogen phosphate (H₂PO₄⁻) and hydrogen phosphate (HPO₄²⁻).\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of each component:**\n*   The solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ from KH₂PO₄ and HPO₄²⁻ from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O.\n*   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles.\n    *   Since KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely, moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 0.007348 mol.\n*   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles.\n    *   Since Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates completely, moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 0.005618 mol.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial concentrations:**\n*   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n*   Initial concentration of H₂PO₄⁻, [H₂PO₄⁻] = moles / volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n*   Initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻, [HPO₄²⁻] = moles / volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n**3. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n*   The solution is a buffer made of the conjugate acid-base pair H₂PO₄⁻ / HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    H₂PO₄⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + HPO₄²⁻(aq)\n*   The equilibrium constant is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n*   Using the expression for Ka₂:\n    Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   We can solve for [H⁺] by rearranging the equation and using the initial concentrations as they are good approximations in a buffer:\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] = 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4.

We use the [H⁺] we just calculated and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] (since the amount that dissociates further is negligible due to the very small Ka₃):\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] = 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option D.
