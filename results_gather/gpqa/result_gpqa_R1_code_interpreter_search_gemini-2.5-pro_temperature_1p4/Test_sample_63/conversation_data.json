    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products of Decomposition:**\n    The problem states that a mixture of salts is heated, and the resulting gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes. We need to identify the gases produced by analyzing the changes in the tubes.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.01 + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight of the tube did not change, no such gases were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate or oxalate ions.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The gas that doesn't react in any of the tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This unreactive gas is most likely nitrogen (N₂), which is a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts:**\n    By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass and elemental composition of the products must equal that of the initial reactants.\n\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H atoms = 2 * (moles of H₂O) = 2 * 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol * 1.01 g/mol ≈ 0.40 g.\n\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both H₂O and O₂.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of H₂O) + 2 * (moles of O₂) = 0.20 mol + 2 * 0.025 mol = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol * 16.00 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming Gas C is N₂.\n        *   Moles of N atoms = 2 * (moles of N₂) = 2 * 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n        *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol * 14.01 g/mol ≈ 2.80 g.\n\n    *   **Total Mass Check:** Let's sum the masses of the elements found:\n        *   Total Mass = Mass(H) + Mass(O) + Mass(N) = 0.40 g + 4.00 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial weight of the mixture (7.20 g). Therefore, the salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    Salts composed of N, H, and O that decompose completely into gaseous products upon heating are typically ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. The most common examples are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). Let's test this hypothesis.\n\n    *   The decomposition reactions that produce the observed gases (N₂, O₂, H₂O) are:\n        *   **NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)**\n        *   **2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)**\n\n    *   The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let `n` be the number of moles of each salt (A and B).\n    *   Let's check if the stoichiometry matches our product mole calculations:\n        *   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n        *   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: `n` moles of N₂ (from 2/2), `0.5n` moles of O₂ (from 1/2), and `2n` moles of H₂O (from 4/2).\n\n    *   **Total moles of products in terms of `n`:**\n        *   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n        *   Total O₂ = 0.5n\n        *   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n\n    *   Now we use our calculated moles of products to find `n`:\n        *   From O₂: 0.025 mol = 0.5n  => n = 0.05 mol\n        *   From N₂: 0.10 mol = 2n       => n = 0.05 mol\n        *   From H₂O: 0.20 mol = 4n     => n = 0.05 mol\n    *   All calculations yield `n = 0.05` mol, confirming our model is consistent.\n\n4.  **Verify the Initial Mass:**\n    If the mixture contains 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂, the total mass should be 7.20 g.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g.\n    *   This confirms our identification of the salts.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    Now we find the number of atoms in the chemical formula of each salt.\n\n    *   **Salt A (e.g., NH₄NO₃):**\n        *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n        *   Oxygen (O): 3\n        *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n        *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2\n        *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n    *   **Total atoms in both salts:**\n        *   Total = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
