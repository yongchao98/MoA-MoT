    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** A \"dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride.\" This describes the conversion of maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid) to maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride is a classic dienophile for the Diels-Alder reaction.\n        *   Let's verify its NMR data. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, so the two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, leading to a single peak in the ¹H NMR spectrum (given as 7 ppm). The four carbons are of two types: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, leading to two peaks in the ¹³C spectrum (given as 137 ppm for C=C and 165 ppm for C=O). This confirms the dienophile is maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each of these four carbons has a methyl group. Position 5 is a CH₂ group. The chemical formula for this diene is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition. The diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) reacts with the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula of the product. Adding the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ gives C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the molecular formula given in the problem, confirming our reactant structures.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. The *endo* product is usually the major product because it is formed faster (kinetically favored due to secondary orbital overlap). The *exo* product is usually the minor product because it is more stable (thermodynamically favored due to less steric hindrance). The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed. We can confidently assign the major product as the *endo* adduct and the minor product as the *exo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structures of the Major (*endo*) and Minor (*exo*) Products**\n    *   The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. Due to the symmetry of both the diene and the dienophile, the resulting adducts also possess a plane of symmetry. This simplifies the NMR spectra.\n    *   There will be four distinct sets of protons in the product, and due to symmetry, all of them should appear as singlets in the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n        1.  **Alkene Methyl Protons (H_Me_a):** Two methyl groups attached to the newly formed double bond. Total of 6H.\n        2.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (H_Me_b):** Two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (where the new C-C bonds formed). Total of 6H.\n        3.  **Anhydride Protons (H_anhydride):** Two protons on the fused anhydride ring. Total of 2H.\n        4.  **Bridge Methylene Protons (H_bridge):** Two protons of the CH₂ bridge from the original cyclopentadiene. Total of 2H.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** In the *endo* conformation, the anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the bicyclic system, on the opposite side of the CH₂ bridge. This places the anhydride protons (H_anhydride) in close proximity to the protons of the alkene methyl groups (H_Me_a).\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** In the *exo* conformation, the anhydride ring is on the same side as the CH₂ bridge. In this arrangement, the anhydride protons (H_anhydride) are far from the alkene methyl protons (H_Me_a) but are close to the bridge methylene protons (H_bridge).\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) is a 2D NMR technique that shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of J-coupling.\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Based on our structural analysis in step 3, the pair of protons that fits this description is the **anhydride protons (H_anhydride)** and the **alkene methyl protons (H_Me_a)**. This interaction will be strong in the *endo* product and very weak or absent in the *exo* product.\n\n5.  **Assign the NMR Signals and Select the Correct Answer**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts and integrals given in the options to the proton groups we identified.\n        *   A **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**: This corresponds to the bridgehead methyl protons (H_Me_b). These are on saturated carbons and are expected to be the most shielded (lowest chemical shift).\n        *   A **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: This corresponds to the alkene methyl protons (H_Me_a). Methyl groups on a double bond are deshielded relative to those on saturated carbons, so their shift is higher.\n        *   A **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This corresponds to the anhydride protons (H_anhydride). These protons are alpha to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups in a strained ring, which significantly deshields them, resulting in a high chemical shift.\n        *   (The descriptions in options B and C mention a \"1H doublet\", which is inconsistent with the highly symmetric structure of the product where all signals should be singlets. We can disregard these options as likely containing typos or being deliberately incorrect.)\n\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n    *   Using our assignments, this corresponds to the signals at **~3.5 ppm (2H, singlet)** and **~1.7 ppm (6H, singlet)**.\n\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\n    *   Option D perfectly matches the two signals we identified as being spatially close in the major product: the alkene methyl protons (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<D>>>"
