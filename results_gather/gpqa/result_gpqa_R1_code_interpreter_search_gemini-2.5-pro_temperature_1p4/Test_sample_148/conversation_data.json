    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** A single proton (an alpha-proton) shows up as two distinct peaks.\n    *   **Observation:** The integrals of these two peaks are roughly equal and sum to 1H.\n    *   **Observation:** Spin-spin coupling is ruled out.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The presence of two peaks for what should be a single proton indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. The fact that the integrals are equal suggests that the two species containing these protons are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude mixture into two distinct peaks of equal intensity.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This confirms the presence of two different compounds in a 1:1 ratio. Since LC separates compounds based on their physical properties (like polarity), these two compounds must have different physical properties.\n    *   **Observation:** The mass spectrometry (MS) data for both peaks is identical and matches the expected molecular weight of the target peptide.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is a critical piece of information. It means both compounds have the same molecular formula and the same mass. They are isomers of each other. This immediately rules out impurities that have a different chemical formula (like precursors or side-products with different numbers of atoms).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Combined Data:**\n\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** Double coupling means an extra amino acid was added. This would create a compound with a significantly higher molecular weight. The MS data, which shows the *expected* mass for both peaks, directly contradicts this. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would be a smaller molecule with a lower molecular weight. Again, the MS data shows both peaks have the same, correct mass for the final product. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **In NMR:** In a standard (achiral) solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce identical NMR spectra. You would see only *one* set of peaks, not two.\n        *   **In LC:** On a standard (achiral) chromatography column, enantiomers are also indistinguishable and will elute together as a *single* peak.\n        *   Since the observations include two NMR peaks and two LC peaks, the compounds cannot be enantiomers. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. This typically happens in peptide synthesis if one of the chiral amino acid building blocks was not enantiomerically pure (e.g., using a mix of L- and D-alanine when only L-alanine was intended, in a peptide that contains other chiral centers).\n        *   **In NMR:** Diastereoisomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical and chemical properties. Their nuclei are in different chemical environments. Therefore, they will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that a specific proton (like the alpha-proton of the epimerized residue) would show a unique peak for each diastereomer. This explains the two peaks. A 1:1 mixture explains the equal integrals.\n        *   **In LC:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This explains the two distinct LC peaks.\n        *   **In MS:** Diastereoisomers have the same molecular formula and therefore the same molecular weight. This explains why both LC peaks give the identical, expected mass spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of a mixture of diastereoisomers is the only explanation that perfectly accounts for all the experimental observations: two peaks in the NMR, two separable peaks in the LC, and identical mass for both separated species. The \"elevated temperature\" in the LC-MS analysis further strengthens this conclusion by suggesting the isomers are stable and not simply rapidly interconverting conformers (like rotamers), which might have merged into a single peak at higher temperatures.\n\n<<<C>>>"
