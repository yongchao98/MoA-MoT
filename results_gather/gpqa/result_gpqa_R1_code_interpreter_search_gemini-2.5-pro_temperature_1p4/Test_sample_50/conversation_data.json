    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. The Method of Images**\n\nThis problem is best solved using the method of images. For a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (`d > R`), the electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are identical to the field and potential that would be produced by the original charge `q` plus a single \"image charge\" `q'`.\n\nThe properties of this image charge are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the grounded sphere is zero (V=0 at r=R). The image charge is:\n\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** Located inside the sphere at a distance `d'` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. The position is `d' = R^2 / d`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the total work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. As the charge `q` is brought closer to the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere's surface, which in turn exert a force on `q`. This means we need to calculate the work done against this force.\n\nThe force on the charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center of the sphere is equivalent to the force exerted on it by its image charge `q'(x)`.\n\n*   At a distance `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x`\n*   At a distance `x`, the image charge position is `d'(x) = R^2/x`\n*   The distance between the charge `q` (at `x`) and its image `q'` (at `d'`) is `x - d'(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\nThe force on charge `q` at position `x` is therefore:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - d'(x))^2`\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R/x) / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n`F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R/x) * (x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2)`\n`F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the force is attractive.\n\n**3. Work Done (Integral Calculation)**\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity (`x = ∞`) to its final position (`x = d`) against this electric force. The work done by the external agent is `W_ext = -W_field`.\n`U = W_ext = ∫_∞^d -F(x) dx`\n`U = ∫_∞^d -(-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R ∫_∞^d x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we can use a u-substitution:\nLet `u = x^2 - R^2`, then `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n`∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) ∫ u^-2 du = (1/2) * (-1 * u^-1) = -1 / (2u)`\n\nSubstituting back `u = x^2 - R^2`:\n`∫ x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral for `U`:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ]` from `∞` to `d`.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))) ]`\nAs `x` approaches `∞`, the term `-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))` approaches 0.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0 ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Alternative (Simpler) Method**\n\nA known result in electrostatics is that the energy of a charge `q` in the presence of conductors it induces charges on is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges. The factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge distribution is not fixed but is created by `q` itself.\n\nThe potential at the position of `q` (distance `d` from the center) due to the image charge `q'` is:\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, calculate the potential energy `U`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. Comparing this with the given options, it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
