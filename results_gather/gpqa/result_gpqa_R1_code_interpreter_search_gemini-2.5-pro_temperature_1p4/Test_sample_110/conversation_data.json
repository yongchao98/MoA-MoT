    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate, which will then attack the electrophilic Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate).\n\n1.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   First, we need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexanone ring. The carbonyl group is at position C1.\n    *   The α-carbons are at C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 carbon is substituted with both an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-protons.\n    *   The C6 carbon is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible position for deprotonation is at C6. The bulky base, t-BuOK, will abstract the single proton from C6 to form the corresponding enolate.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate formed is nucleophilic at the C6 carbon.\n    *   It will attack the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond will form between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the initial addition, a workup step (usually involving a proton source like water, which is implicit) will protonate the intermediate to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (A):**\n    *   The resulting product will have the original cyclohexanone core with its substituents, plus a new `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached at the C6 position.\n    *   The structure will be a cyclohexanone ring with:\n        *   An oxo group (=O) at C1.\n        *   An ethyl and a methyl group at C2.\n        *   A methyl group at C6.\n        *   An ethyl propanoate group (`-CH₂CH₂COOEt`) also at C6.\n\n4.  **Product Nomenclature:**\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, the principal functional group is the ester, so the parent name is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain at position 3.\n    *   For naming the substituent ring, the point of attachment is designated as C1'. To give the other substituents the lowest possible locants, the carbonyl group (oxo) gets position C2'.\n    *   Following this numbering for the substituent:\n        *   The attachment point (original C6) is C1'. It has a methyl group (`1'-methyl`).\n        *   The carbonyl carbon (original C1) is C2' (`2'-oxo`).\n        *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) is C3' (`3'-ethyl`, `3'-methyl`).\n    *   Combining these gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name given for A in options A and B.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) as the base and water (H₂O).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is another Michael addition, often called a nitro-Michael addition.\n\n1.  **Carbanion Formation:**\n    *   The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon) in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂) are acidic.\n    *   The base, KOH, will deprotonate the α-carbon (C1 of the propane chain) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate). The nucleophile is `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nitronate anion acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   It attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group (`CH₃-CH=`).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The structure is formed by connecting `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-` to `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n\n4.  **Product Nomenclature:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon is C1.\n    *   We must find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   The substituents on this chain are a `methyl` group at C3 and a `nitro` group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given for B in options A and D.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option A contains both correct product names.\n\n<<<A>>>"
