    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the chemical formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\nZ is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CxHy.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%, which is 0.1428.\nMass fraction of H = (Atomic mass of H * y) / (Molecular Mass of CxHy)\n0.1428 = (1 * y) / (12 * x + 1 * y)\n*Using approximate integer atomic masses: H=1, C=12.*\n1 / 0.1428 ≈ 7\nSo, (12x + y) / y = 7\n12x/y + 1 = 7\n12x/y = 6\nx/y = 6/12 = 1/2\nThis means the ratio of hydrogen atoms to carbon atoms is 2:1, so the empirical formula is CH2. The general formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n\nThe problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CnH(2n+2). The general formula for a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CnH2n.\nSince the formula of Z is CnH2n, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific molecule Z.**\nZ is a common solvent. The simplest cycloalkanes are cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, and cyclohexane. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very widely used industrial solvent. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n*   Formula: C6H12. This fits CnH2n.\n*   Mass %H: (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This matches.\n*   It's a saturated cycloalkane.\n*   It's a common solvent.\nSo, Z is very likely Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of these liquids is Z, which is Cyclohexane (C6H12). Let the other liquid be D.\nSo, Y = {Cyclohexane, D}.\nMixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react. So, D must also not decolorize bromine water (implying it is saturated or aromatic).\nHydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (Cyclohexane).\n*   Hydrogenation of Cyclohexane gives Cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of D must also give Cyclohexane.\nFor D to be hydrogenated to Cyclohexane, it must have the same C6 carbon skeleton. The only common C6 compound that fits this and doesn't decolorize bromine water is Benzene (C6H6). Benzene is aromatic and only gets hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high temperature and pressure with a catalyst), which matches the description.\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of Benzene (C6H6) and Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the reaction from mixture X to mixture Y.**\nMixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B), is treated with platinum when heated to form mixture Y.\nThe reaction is:\nA + B --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)\nThis is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X loses hydrogen (is dehydrogenated) to form benzene, while the other component gains hydrogen (is hydrogenated) to form cyclohexane. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X.**\nBased on the principle of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\nReactants: one molecule of A + one molecule of B\nProducts: one molecule of Benzene + one molecule of Cyclohexane\n\nTotal H atoms in products = (H atoms in C6H6) + (H atoms in C6H12)\nTotal H atoms in products = 6 + 12 = 18\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**Verification of the scenario (Optional but confirms consistency):**\n*   **Mixture X**: Must contain two C6 cyclic compounds (since they both form C6 cyclic products). They must be unsaturated (decolorize bromine water) and not have conjugated double bonds. They must have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms. A plausible pair is Cyclohexene (C6H10) and Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. (Correct)\n    *   Both are unsaturated. (Correct)\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is not conjugated. (Correct)\n    *   Reaction: C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer. The diene loses 2H to become benzene, and the hexene gains 2H to become cyclohexane. (Consistent)\n    *   Hydrogenation of X: Hydrogenating C6H10 and C6H8 both yield C6H12 (Cyclohexane). (Consistent)\n\nThe logic is sound. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
