    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical model:** The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" with a \"spheroid shape\" and a \"symmetry axis along the z-axis\". The simplest and most dominant form of radiation from a compact oscillating charge distribution is electric dipole radiation. We can model this system as an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis. The \"spheroid shape\" describes the object within which the charge oscillation occurs. Higher-order radiation, like quadrupole radiation, is generally much weaker and only becomes dominant if the dipole moment is zero by symmetry, which is not stated to be the case here. Therefore, we'll proceed by analyzing the radiation from an oscillating electric dipole.\n\n2.  **Analyze the angular dependence of radiated power:** For an electric dipole `p` oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` is given by the formula:\n    `dP/dΩ = f(θ, λ) ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis). The power is independent of the azimuthal angle `φ` due to the symmetry around the z-axis.\n\n3.  **Find the maximum radiated power (A):** The radiated power `f` is a function of `θ`. The maximum power `A` is achieved when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs when `θ = 90°` (or `π/2` radians). This means the maximum radiation is in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis.\n    So, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the power at θ = 30°:** We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We substitute this angle into the radiation pattern formula:\n    `Power at 30° ∝ sin²(30°)`\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the fraction of the maximum power:** The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power.\n    Fraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = `sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\n6.  **Analyze the wavelength (λ) dependence:** The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the Larmor formula, which shows that the power is proportional to the square of the acceleration of the charges. For a sinusoidal oscillation with angular frequency `ω`, the acceleration is proportional to `ω²`, and the power is proportional to `(acceleration)²`, so `P ∝ (ω²)² = ω⁴`.\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    Substituting this into the power dependence, we get:\n    `P ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n    This means the radiated power per unit solid angle, `f`, is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n7.  **Combine the results:**\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    *   A possible form of the function `f` includes a dependence on `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n    Matching these two results with the given options, we find that option C fits our derivation.\n\nFinal check of the alternative (Quadrupole Radiation, Option A): This would correspond to an oscillating shape (e.g., from prolate to oblate spheroid). The power would be `∝ sin²θ cos²θ` and `∝ λ⁻⁶`. The maximum is at `θ=45°`. The power at 30° relative to the maximum at 45° would be `[sin²(30)cos²(30)] / [sin²(45)cos²(45)] = [(1/4)(3/4)] / [(1/2)(1/2)] = (3/16)/(1/4) = 3/4`. So, Option A corresponds to quadrupole radiation. Given the standard interpretation of \"oscillating charge distribution\" in electromagnetism problems, the dipole model is the most appropriate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
