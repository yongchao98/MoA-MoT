    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics Principles\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$). This is a two-body decay at rest. The key physical principles that govern this process are:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n### 2. Define Variables and Initial Conditions\n\n*   **Before Decay:**\n    *   The pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary.\n    *   Rest mass energy of the pion, $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV.\n    *   Since it's stationary, its initial momentum $p_{\\pi}$ is 0.\n    *   Its total initial energy $E_{initial}$ is its rest mass energy, so $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV.\n\n*   **After Decay:**\n    *   The products are a muon ($\\mu^+$) and a neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$).\n    *   Rest mass energy of the muon, $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV.\n    *   The neutrino's rest mass is considered to be zero ($m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$), which is a standard and excellent approximation for this type of problem.\n    *   Let the momentum of the muon be $\\vec{p_{\\mu}}$ and the momentum of the neutrino be $\\vec{p_{\\nu}}$.\n    *   Let the total energy of the muon be $E_{\\mu}$ and the total energy of the neutrino be $E_{\\nu}$.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Momentum\n\nAccording to the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must be zero, as the initial momentum was zero.\n$\\vec{p_{\\mu}} + \\vec{p_{\\nu}} = 0$\nThis implies that the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n$|\\vec{p_{\\mu}}| = |\\vec{p_{\\nu}}| = p$\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation of Energy\n\nThe total initial energy equals the sum of the total energies of the final particles.\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n*   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (105.7 \\text{ MeV})^2}$\n*   For the neutrino (with $m_{\\nu}=0$): $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\nu}c)^2 + (0)^2} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2} = pc$\n\nNow, substitute these into the energy conservation equation:\n$139.6 \\text{ MeV} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (105.7 \\text{ MeV})^2} + pc$\n\n### 5. Solve for the Momentum (pc)\n\nTo solve for `pc`, we rearrange the equation and square it to eliminate the square root.\n$139.6 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (105.7)^2}$\n$(139.6 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (105.7)^2$\n$(139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (105.7)^2$\n\nThe $(pc)^2$ terms on both sides cancel out.\n$(139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)(pc) = (105.7)^2$\n$(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 = 2(139.6)(pc)$\n\n$pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}$\n\nThis calculation can be done with a calculator or a simple script.\n\n### 6. Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE)\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    For a massless particle, the total energy is all kinetic energy. We found that $E_{\\nu} = pc$. Therefore:\n    $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):**\n    The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy: $KE = E - m_0c^2$.\n    $KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n    From the energy conservation equation, we know $E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu}$.\n    So, $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu}) - m_{\\mu}c^2 = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} - KE_{\\nu}$\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform these calculations accurately.\n```python\n# Define the rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate pc (momentum * c) using the derived formula\n# pc = ( (m_pi_c2)^2 - (m_mu_c2)^2 ) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino is equal to its total energy, which is pc\nKE_neutrino = pc\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon\n# KE_muon = Total Energy Released - KE_neutrino\n# Total Energy Released = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\nKE_muon = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2 - KE_neutrino\n\n# Print the results, formatted to match the options\nprint(f\"KE of muon: {KE_muon:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino: {KE_neutrino:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n> executing\n> KE of muon: 4.12 MeV\n> KE of neutrino: 29.78 MeV\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Kinetic energy of the neutrino: 29.78 MeV (approximately 29.8 MeV)\n*   Kinetic energy of the muon: 4.12 MeV\n\nThese results match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a summary of the reasoning and calculation:\n\n1.  **Conservation Laws:** The decay is governed by the conservation of energy and momentum.\n    *   **Initial State:** A stationary pion ($\\pi^+$) with rest mass energy $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV and zero momentum ($p_{initial} = 0$).\n    *   **Final State:** A muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu_{\\mu}$) moving in opposite directions.\n        *   Rest mass energy of muon: $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV.\n        *   Rest mass energy of neutrino: $m_{\\nu}c^2 \\approx 0$.\n\n2.  **Momentum Conservation:** Since the initial momentum is zero, the final momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   $|\\vec{p_{\\mu}}| = |\\vec{p_{\\nu}}| = p$\n\n3.  **Energy Conservation:** The initial energy equals the total final energy.\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    *   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + p_{\\nu}c$\n    *   $139.6 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (105.7)^2} + pc$\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Rearranging the energy equation to solve for the momentum term `pc`:\n        $139.6 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (105.7)^2}$\n    *   Squaring both sides:\n        $(139.6 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (105.7)^2$\n        $139.6^2 - 2(139.6)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + 105.7^2$\n    *   Solving for `pc`:\n        $pc = \\frac{139.6^2 - 105.7^2}{2 \\times 139.6}$\n\n5.  **Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   **Neutrino:** For a massless particle, kinetic energy is its total energy, so $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n    *   **Muon:** Kinetic energy is total energy minus rest energy, $KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$. From energy conservation, $E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu}$. Therefore, $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu}) - m_{\\mu}c^2 = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2) - KE_{\\nu}$.\n\n6.  **Code Output Verification:**\n    The Python script executed the above calculations:\n    *   `KE of muon: 4.12 MeV`\n    *   `KE of neutrino: 29.78 MeV`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV for the muon and approximately 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
