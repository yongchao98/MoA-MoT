    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material C8H9NO from the NMR data.**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For a formula CxHyNzOw, DBE = x - y/2 + z/2 + 1. For C8H9NO, DBE = 8 - 9/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O) or ring.\n    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), means it's adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (2 protons on the adjacent carbon -> 2+1 = 3 peaks, a triplet).\n        *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal for 2 protons is in the range for a methylene group (-CH2-) attached to an electron-withdrawing group. The doublet (d) splitting indicates it's adjacent to a single proton (-CH-), which is consistent with the aldehyde proton. So, we have a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each being a doublet integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons that disappears upon D2O shake is typical for a primary amine (-NH2). The nitrogen in the molecular formula supports this assignment.\n\n    *   **Assembling the structure:**\n        *   We have a benzene ring with two substituents in a *para* arrangement (positions 1 and 4).\n        *   One substituent is the primary amine group (-NH2).\n        *   The other substituent is the ethyl aldehyde fragment (-CH2CHO).\n        *   Let's check if the resulting structure, **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**, matches the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n            *   Benzene ring part: C6H4\n            *   Amine group: NH2\n            *   Acetaldehyde side chain: C2H3O\n            *   Total: C(6+2)H(4+2+3)N1O1 = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n        *   The structure is consistent with all the NMR data. Therefore, the starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n    1.  **NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization):** This set of reagents, typically used at low temperature (0-5 °C), converts a primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) into an aryldiazonium salt (Ar-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The amine group of 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to a diazonium group.\n        *   Intermediate after step 1: Diazonium salt of phenylacetaldehyde, [⁺N₂-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO]Cl⁻.\n\n    2.  **H2O (Hydrolysis of Diazonium Salt):** Adding water and warming the solution causes the diazonium group (-N₂⁺), which is an excellent leaving group, to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction releases nitrogen gas.\n        *   Intermediate after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** (HO-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n\n    3.  **aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation):** This step involves treating an aldehyde with α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group are alpha to the -CHO group) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This condition promotes an aldol condensation reaction.\n        *   **Mechanism:**\n            a.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n            b.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            c.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol addition product. In this case, it would be 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option D).\n            d.  **Dehydration:** The presence of **heat** strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product (dehydration). The α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This is the condensation step.\n        *   **Product of Condensation:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal results in the formation of a double bond between the α-carbon (C2) and β-carbon (C3).\n            *   The final structure is HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH=C(CHO)-C₆H₄-OH.\n            *   The IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare with the given options.**\n    *   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. The phenyl groups should be hydroxylated.\n    *   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect. This is not a product of self-condensation.\n    *   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: Correct. This matches the final product from the aldol condensation (with dehydration due to heat).\n    *   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: Incorrect. This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
