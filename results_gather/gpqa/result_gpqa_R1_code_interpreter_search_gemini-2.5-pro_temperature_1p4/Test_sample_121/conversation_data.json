    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid is brominated on its alpha-carbon (the methyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a strong nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion via an SN2 reaction. The bromine is on a primary carbon, making this reaction efficient.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:**\n    1.  The hydrogens on the alpha-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate (the CH2 group between the CN and COOEt groups) are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because they are flanked by two strong electron-withdrawing groups.\n    2.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the alpha-carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (an enolate): `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻`.\n    3.  This nucleophilic carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing one bromine atom in a first alkylation step. This forms an intermediate: `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br`.\n    4.  The problem states \"excess\" NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the remaining acidic alpha-proton on the intermediate, forming a second carbanion: `[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻`.\n    5.  This newly formed carbanion will undergo a second, intramolecular SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom. This cyclization forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Structure of Final Product 4:**\n\n```\n      COOCH2CH3\n      /\n(C1)-CN\n|   \\\nC2H2-C6H2\n|     |\nC3H2-C5H2\n  \\  /\n   C4H2\n```\n(Where COOEt represents the ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOCH2CH3)\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Product 4 has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This plane bisects the cyclohexane ring.\n\nDue to this plane of symmetry:\n*   The carbons on the left side of the plane are equivalent to the carbons on the right side: C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n*   Consequently, protons on C2 are equivalent to protons on C6, and protons on C3 are equivalent to protons on C5.\n\nLet's count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-CH2-) are enantiotopic. They are interchangeable by reflection through the molecule's plane of symmetry but are not otherwise equivalent. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent (isochronous). They will produce **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** These two carbons are equivalent. On each carbon, there are two protons: one axial (H_ax) and one equatorial (H_eq). The axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon are diastereotopic because they have a different spatial relationship to the substituents on C1. Therefore, they are chemically non-equivalent. This gives one signal for the two equivalent axial protons (on C2 and C6) and another signal for the two equivalent equatorial protons (on C2 and C6). This accounts for **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similar to the C2/C6 pair, C3 and C5 are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons on C3 (and C5) are diastereotopic. This gives one signal for the two H_ax (on C3 and C5) and another for the two H_eq (on C3 and C5). This accounts for **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. It also has an axial and an equatorial proton. These two protons are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the bulky substituents at C1. Therefore, they are chemically non-equivalent. This accounts for **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (CH2) = 2 signals.\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals.\n*   **Total number of distinct hydrogen signals = 2 + 6 = 8.**\n\n<<<A>>>"
