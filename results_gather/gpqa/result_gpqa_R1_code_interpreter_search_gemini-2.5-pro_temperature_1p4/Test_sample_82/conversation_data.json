    "This problem involves a two-step calculation for the pH of a solution at different stages of a titration.\n\n**Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution.\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   The initial volume of 20.00 cm³ (0.0200 L) is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   Final volume of the acid solution = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n*   The new concentration of acetic acid is [CH₃COOH] = Moles / Final Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\nThis 0.025 M acetic acid solution is what we start the titration with.\n\n**Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), by reacting with NaOH. This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid and its conjugate base.\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to calculate the pH of a buffer:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵)\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is 25% to 75%.\n    [A⁻]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\n*   We can now calculate the pH:\n    pH = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3)\n\nLet's perform the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# Calculate pH at 25% titration\n# The ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\nprint(f'The pH at 25% titration is {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}')\n\n# At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate.\n# Moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol (from step 1)\n# Volume of NaOH needed for equivalence = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L\n# Total volume at equivalence point = Initial acid volume + Volume of NaOH added = 0.0400 L + 0.010 L = 0.050 L\n# Concentration of acetate at equivalence point = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n# At the equivalence point, the acetate ion (a weak base) hydrolyzes water:\n# CH3COO- + H2O <=> CH3COOH + OH-\n# We need to find Kb for acetate.\nKw = 1.0e-14\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Set up the ICE table for the hydrolysis of acetate (B for base):\n# B + H2O <=> BH+ + OH-\n# I: 0.02 M        0      0\n# C: -x           +x     +x\n# E: 0.02-x        x      x\n# Kb = [BH+][OH-]/[B] = (x)(x) / (0.02-x)\n# Assume x is small, so 0.02-x ≈ 0.02\n# Kb = x^2 / 0.02\n# x = [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * 0.02)\nx = math.sqrt((Kb * 0.02))\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(x)\npH_at_equivalence = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f'The pH at the equivalence point is {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}')\n```\n\n**Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\nAt the equivalence point, all the initial 0.001 moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by the NaOH, forming 0.001 moles of sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base and will hydrolyze water.\n*   **Reaction of Acetate with Water:**\n    CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   **Volume Calculation:** First, find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Total Volume at Equivalence:**\n    Total Volume = Initial acid volume + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   **Concentration of Acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]):**\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻]:** We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) = 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰.\n    Using the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    Let x = [OH⁻]. Then, [CH₃COOH] = x, and [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n    Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we can simplify: Kb ≈ x² / 0.02.\n    x² = Kb × 0.02 = (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.08 × 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.08 × 10⁻¹¹) = 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) = 5.48.\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26\n*   pH at the equivalence point ≈ 8.52\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 4.73; 7.00\nB) 3.17; 6.73\nC) 4.26; 8.52\nD) 4.57; 6.92\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "**Detailed Step-by-Step Derivations**\n\n**Step 1: Dilution of the Acetic Acid Solution**\nFirst, we determine the concentration of the acetic acid after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Moles of acetic acid = M₁ × V₁ = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol\n*   Volume of water added: 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n*   Final volume of the solution (V₂): 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n*   Final concentration of acetic acid (M₂): Moles / V₂ = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = **0.025 M**\n\nSo, the titration starts with 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Calculating pH at 25% Titration**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This means the solution contains 75% of the original acetic acid and 25% acetate, forming a buffer solution.\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n2.  **Calculate the ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    At 25% titration, the ratio of moles of A⁻ to HA is 25:75 or 1:3. Since they are in the same volume, the concentration ratio is the same.\n    [A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n\n3.  **Calculate pH:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - log(3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n**Step 3: Calculating pH at the Equivalence Point**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The solution now contains only sodium acetate (the salt of the weak acid). The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) acts as a weak base and hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻ ions.\n\nCH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\n1.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed:**\n    Moles of HA = 0.001 mol (from Step 1)\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles of HA / Molarity of NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n2.  **Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point:**\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]):**\n    The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    Moles of CH₃COO⁻ = 0.001 mol\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**\n\n4.  **Calculate [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n    Using the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n    Kb = x² / ([CH₃COO⁻] - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02 M.\n    Kb ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² = Kb × 0.02 = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n5.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThese values correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
