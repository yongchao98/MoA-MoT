    "Here's my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to calculate the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to the luminosity of Star_2 (L2), i.e., L1 / L2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:**\n    *   **Luminosity:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n        L = A * σ * T⁴ = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴\n        where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Temperature and Color:** The temperature (T) of a black body is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_peak) by Wien's Displacement Law:\n        λ_peak * T = b\n        where b is Wien's constant. This can be written as T = b / λ_peak.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the wavelength emitted in the source's own rest frame (λ_rest). For an object moving with a radial velocity `v_r` (positive for moving away, negative for moving towards), the observed wavelength is given by:\n        λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c)\n        where c is the speed of light. This is a valid approximation for velocities much smaller than the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    *   I need to find L1 / L2.\n    *   L1 = 4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴\n    *   L2 = 4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴\n    *   Dividing L1 by L2, the constants (4, π, σ) cancel out:\n        L1 / L2 = (R1² * T1⁴) / (R2² * T2⁴)\n        L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Information and Calculate Intermediate Ratios:**\n\n    *   **Radius Ratio (R1 / R2):** The problem states that \"Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2\".\n        R1 = 1.5 * R2\n        Therefore, (R1 / R2) = 1.5.\n\n    *   **Temperature Ratio (T1 / T2):** This is the crucial part.\n        *   The problem states that \"the wavelengths at which the stars **appeared brightest** ... are the same.\" This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (λ_obs).\n        *   So, λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n        *   However, the temperature (T) is related to the **rest-frame** peak wavelength (λ_rest) via Wien's law (T = b / λ_rest).\n        *   I must use the Doppler effect to relate the observed and rest-frame wavelengths.\n        *   For Star_1: v_r1 = 0 km/s. The star is not moving relative to us, so its observed wavelength is the same as its rest-frame wavelength.\n            λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1 * (1 + 0/c) => λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1.\n        *   For Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. This star is moving away from us.\n            λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v_r2 / c) = λ_rest,2 * (1 + 700/c).\n        *   Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can equate the expressions for the rest-frame wavelengths:\n            λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + 700/c).\n        *   Now I can find the temperature ratio.\n            T1 = b / λ_rest,1\n            T2 = b / λ_rest,2\n            (T1 / T2) = (b / λ_rest,1) / (b / λ_rest,2) = λ_rest,2 / λ_rest,1.\n        *   From the relationship λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + 700/c), we get:\n            λ_rest,2 / λ_rest,1 = 1 / (1 + 700/c).\n        *   Therefore, (T1 / T2) = 1 / (1 + 700/c).\n\n    *   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the masses (M1 = 1.5 * M2) is not needed for this calculation, as the luminosity formula depends on radius and temperature, not directly on mass.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now I substitute the intermediate ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    *   L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴\n    *   L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + 700/c)]⁴\n    *   L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700/c)⁴\n\n6.  **Numerical Computation:** I will use a Python script to perform the final high-precision calculation. I will use the standard value for the speed of light, c ≈ 299792.458 km/s.\n\n```python\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc = 299792.458\n\n# Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\nv_r2 = 700.0\n\n# Radius ratio R1/R2\nR_ratio = 1.5\n\n# The luminosity ratio is given by L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# We found that T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c)\n# So, L1/L2 = (R_ratio)^2 / (1 + v_r2/c)^4\n\nluminosity_ratio = (R_ratio**2) / ((1 + v_r2 / c)**4)\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n> Executing the code...\n> \n> **Code Execution Output:**\n> ```text\n> 2.2291079313276635\n> ```\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.2291. Looking at the given options:\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.25\n    C) ~2.35\n    D) ~2.23\n\n    The value 2.2291 is closest to 2.23. The small difference from 2.25 is due to the relativistic Doppler shift of Star_2's light, which makes its true temperature slightly higher than it appears.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a black body is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL = A * σ * T⁴\nwhere A is the surface area of the star, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature of the star.\nThe surface area of a spherical star is A = 4 * π * R², where R is the radius.\nSo, L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to the luminosity of Star_2 (L2):\nL1 / L2 = (4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴) / (4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴)\n\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\nL1 / L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴) = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴\n\nNext, we need to determine the ratios for the radii and temperatures from the information given.\n\n**1. Radius Ratio (R1 / R2):**\nThe problem states that \"Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2\".\nSo, R1 = 1.5 * R2, which means (R1 / R2) = 1.5.\n\n**2. Temperature Ratio (T1 / T2):**\nThe temperature of a star is related to the peak wavelength (λ_peak) of its emitted radiation by Wien's Displacement Law:\nT = b / λ_peak, where b is Wien's constant.\nThis means T is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength emitted by the star in its own rest frame (λ_rest).\nSo, T1 / T2 = (b / λ_rest,1) / (b / λ_rest,2) = λ_rest,2 / λ_rest,1.\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\nWe must account for the Doppler effect, which relates the observed wavelength to the rest-frame wavelength:\nλ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star_1: v_r1 = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift.\nλ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_rest,1\n\nFor Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. The light is redshifted.\nλ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v_r2 / c) = λ_rest,2 * (1 + 700/c)\n\nSince λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can set the expressions equal:\nλ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + 700/c)\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths:\nλ_rest,2 / λ_rest,1 = 1 / (1 + 700/c)\n\nThis gives us the temperature ratio:\nT1 / T2 = λ_rest,2 / λ_rest,1 = 1 / (1 + 700/c)\n\n**3. Final Calculation:**\nNow we substitute the ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\nL1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴\nL1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + 700/c)]⁴\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700/c)⁴\n\nUsing the value of the speed of light, c ≈ 299792.458 km/s, and the value of v_r2 = 700 km/s, we get:\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 299792.458)⁴\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 0.00233496)⁴\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1.00233496)⁴\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 / 1.009376\nL1 / L2 ≈ 2.2291\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.\nNote that the mass information is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n\nComparing our result to the options:\nA) ~2.32\nB) ~2.25\nC) ~2.35\nD) ~2.23\n\nThe calculated factor is ~2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>"
