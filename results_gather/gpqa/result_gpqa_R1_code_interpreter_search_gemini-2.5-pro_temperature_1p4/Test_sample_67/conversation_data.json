    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    Initially, the particle's magnetic moment `mu = gamma * S` is aligned with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. This means the particle is in the eigenstate of the spin operator in the z-direction, `Sz`, with the spin pointing up. We denote this state as `|+z>`.\n    So, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction, so `B_vector = B * y_hat`. The Hamiltonian `H` of the system for `t > 0` is given by the interaction energy between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field:\n    `H = -mu . B_vector = -(gamma * S) . (B * y_hat) = -gamma * B * Sy`\n    Here, `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution:**\n    The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H * t / ħ) * |ψ(0)>`\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian and the initial state:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-gamma * B * Sy) * t / ħ) * |+z>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * gamma * B * Sy * t / ħ) * |+z>`\n\n4.  **Work in the Eigenbasis of the New Hamiltonian:**\n    The calculation is simplest in the basis of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H`. Since `H` is proportional to `Sy`, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `Sy`, which we denote as `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n\n    *   The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The corresponding eigenstates are `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n\n    The energies of these states are the eigenvalues of `H`:\n    *   `E_+y = <+y|H|+y> = -gamma * B * <+y|Sy|+y> = -gamma * B * (ħ/2)`\n    *   `E_-y = <-y|H|-y> = -gamma * B * <-y|Sy|-y> = -gamma * B * (-ħ/2) = +gamma * B * (ħ/2)`\n\n    The energy difference between these two levels is `ΔE = E_-y - E_+y = (gamma * B * ħ / 2) - (-gamma * B * ħ / 2) = gamma * B * ħ`.\n\n5.  **Express the Initial State in the New Basis:**\n    We need to write the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of `|+y>` and `|-y>`. In the standard `Sz` basis:\n    `|+z> = [1, 0]`\n    `|+y> = (1/√2) * [1, i]`\n    `|-y> = (1/√2) * [1, -i]`\n    From these, we can find that:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time-Evolved State:**\n    Now we apply the time evolution operator to the initial state expressed in the `Sy` basis:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)> = (1/√2) * [exp(-iHt/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iHt/ħ)|-y>]`\n    Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are energy eigenstates:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(-i*E_+y*t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-i*E_-y*t/ħ)|-y>]`\n    Substituting the energy values:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(i * gamma * B * t / 2)|+y> + exp(-i * gamma * B * t / 2)|-y>]`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Observable:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz(t)>`.\n    `<μz(t)> = <ψ(t)| μz |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| gamma * Sz |ψ(t)> = gamma * <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`\n\n    To calculate `<ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`, it's convenient to switch `|ψ(t)>` back to the `Sz` basis. Substituting the expressions for `|+y>` and `|-y>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [exp(iωt/2)(|+z>+i|-z>) + exp(-iωt/2)(|+z>-i|-z>)]`\n    where we define the Larmor frequency `ω = gamma * B`.\n    Grouping the `|+z>` and `|-z>` terms:\n    `|ψ(t)> = ( (exp(iωt/2)+exp(-iωt/2))/2 ) |+z> + i * ( (exp(iωt/2)-exp(-iωt/2))/2 ) |-z>`\n    Using Euler's formulas (`cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2` and `sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/(2i)`):\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> + i * (i * sin(ωt/2))|-z>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`\n\n    Now we can compute `<Sz>(t)`:\n    `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`\n    `<Sz>(t) = [cos(ωt/2)<-z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|] * Sz * [cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>]`\n    `Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `Sz|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`.\n    `<Sz>(t) = [cos(ωt/2)<-z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|] * [cos(ωt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> + sin(ωt/2)(ħ/2)|-z>]`\n    Using orthogonality (`<+z|-z>=0`) and normalization (`<+z|+z>=1`, `<-z|-z>=1`):\n    `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`:\n    `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n8.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μz(t)> = gamma * <Sz>(t) = gamma * (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n    The oscillation is described by the `cos(ωt)` term. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n    We defined `ω = gamma * B`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector `<S>` precesses around the magnetic field `B` at the Larmor frequency `ω = gamma * B`. Since the spin starts along the Z-axis and the field is along the Y-axis, the Z-component of the spin will oscillate as `cos(ωt)`, and the oscillation frequency is `ω`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `gamma * B`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
