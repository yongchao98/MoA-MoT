    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down each signal provided:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal corresponds to three equivalent protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** A chemical shift around 2.0-2.2 ppm is highly characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group in an acetate ester (-O-C(=O)-CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet means these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with. This confirms the acetate fragment, as the methyl group is isolated.\n\n*   **The remaining signals (7.0, 5.5, and 1.6 ppm) must describe the alkyl/alkenyl part of the ester.**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n        *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The high chemical shift is because this proton is directly attached to the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom of the ester (`=CH-O-`).\n        *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet, meaning it's coupled to one neighboring proton.\n        *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a large value for a coupling constant between two vinylic protons. This is the key to determining the stereochemistry.\n\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n        *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n        *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region.\n        *   **Splitting (dq):** A doublet of quartets. This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons:\n            *   The **doublet (d)** part comes from being coupled to one other proton (this would be the proton at 7.0 ppm).\n            *   The **quartet (q)** part comes from being coupled to three equivalent protons (i.e., a methyl group).\n\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n        *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl group.\n        *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is a typical shift for a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond (an allylic methyl group).\n        *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet, meaning it is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This proton must be the one at 5.5 ppm (the dq signal).\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Structure**\n\nLet's piece together the fragments identified above:\n1.  We have an **acetate group**: `-O-C(=O)-CH3`.\n2.  The remaining signals describe a `CH3-CH=CH-` group.\n    *   The `1.6 ppm (3H, d)` signal is the `CH3-` group.\n    *   This `CH3-` group is coupled to the proton that gives the `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)` signal, making it `CH3-CH=`.\n    *   This `CH` proton is also coupled to one other proton, which must be the one at `7.0 ppm (1H, d)`, giving the full fragment `CH3-CH=CH-`.\n3.  Combining the acetate group and the alkenyl fragment gives the structure **CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3**, which is **propenyl acetate**. This structure has a total of 8 protons (3+1+1+3), which matches the sum of the integrations in the NMR data (3+1+1+3). This rules out the \"butenyl\" options, which would have more protons.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe stereochemistry of the double bond is determined by the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons (the ones at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm).\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   **Rule of thumb for vinylic coupling:**\n    *   A *trans* arrangement (protons on opposite sides of the C=C bond) has a large coupling constant, typically **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   A *cis* arrangement (protons on the same side of the C=C bond) has a smaller coupling constant, typically **6-12 Hz**.\n*   Since the observed J value is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely within the range for a *trans* configuration.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the fragments, their connectivity, the total proton count, and the critical coupling constant value, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) Cis-butenyl acetate - Incorrect structure and stereochemistry.\nB) Cis-propenyl acetate - Correct structure but incorrect stereochemistry (would have J â‰ˆ 6-12 Hz).\nC) Trans-propenyl acetate - Correct structure and stereochemistry (J = 16.0 Hz).\nD) Trans-butenyl acetate - Incorrect structure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
