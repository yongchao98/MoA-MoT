    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the normalized eigenvector for a quantum mechanical spin operator $\\vec{P}$ pointing in a specific direction $\\vec{n}$, corresponding to a given positive eigenvalue.\n\n2.  **Define the Operator Components:** The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ in the x, y, and z directions. These are proportional to the well-known Pauli matrices:\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_x$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_y$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z$\n    This operator $\\vec{P}$ represents the spin angular momentum of a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.\n\n3.  **Define the Direction Vector:** The problem states that the operator is along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector ($\\vec{n}$) in 3D space is described in spherical coordinates by angles $\\theta$ (polar angle from the z-axis) and $\\phi$ (azimuthal angle from the x-axis in the x-y plane). The components are $n_x = \\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi$, $n_y = \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi$, and $n_z = \\cos\\theta$.\n    Since the vector lies in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero ($n_y = 0$). This implies $\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi=0$. We assume a non-trivial direction, so $\\sin\\theta \\ne 0$. This leaves us with $\\sin\\phi=0$, which means $\\phi=0$ or $\\phi=\\pi$. By convention, we'll choose $\\phi=0$.\n    Thus, the unit direction vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n4.  **Construct the Operator along** $\\vec{n}$: The operator for the spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Substituting the components:\n    $P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_x\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_y\\right) (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n    Now, substitute the matrices for $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 1 \\cdot \\cos\\theta & 1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta \\\\ 1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta & 0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta - 1 \\cdot \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:** We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n6.  **Solve the Equation:** We can cancel the constant $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix equation represents a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's rearrange the first equation:\n    $b\\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    Now, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities: $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$.\n    $b(2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)) = a(2\\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\n    Assuming $\\theta$ is not 0 or $2\\pi$, we can divide both sides by $2\\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b\\cos(\\theta/2) = a\\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    This gives the relationship between the components $a$ and $b$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    So, any eigenvector must be a multiple of the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. To avoid fractions, we can multiply by $\\cos(\\theta/2)$, which gives a vector proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n7.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:** The state vector (eigenvector) in quantum mechanics must be normalized, meaning its norm (length) must be 1. Let our eigenvector be $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$, where C is a normalization constant.\n    The normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$, which for a column vector is the dot product of its conjugate transpose with itself.\n    $|\\psi|^2 = |C|^2 \\left( (\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 \\right) = 1$\n    Using the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$:\n    $|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$\n    We can choose the simplest normalization constant, $C=1$.\n\n8.  **Final Eigenvector:** The normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$ is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n9.  **Match with Options:** Comparing our result with the given choices:\n    A) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$ - Incorrect, uses $\\theta$ instead of $\\theta/2$.\n    B) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Incorrect, contains $\\hbar$ and is not normalized.\n    C) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Correct.\n    D) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect, contains $\\hbar$, not normalized, and no angular dependence.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
