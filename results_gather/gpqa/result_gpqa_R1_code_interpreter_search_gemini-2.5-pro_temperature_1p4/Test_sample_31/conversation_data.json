Standard tables provide the atomic mass of a neutral $^{6}\\text{Li}$ atom, which includes the mass of its 3 electrons. We must subtract the electron mass to get the nuclear mass.\n    *   We can use a Python script with high-precision values for this calculation.\n        *   Atomic mass of $^{6}\\text{Li}$ atom: 6.0151228874 u\n        *   Rest mass of an electron: 0.000548579909 u\n        *   Mass of $^{6}\\text{Li}$ nucleus = (Atomic mass) - (3 * Electron mass)\n          = 6.0151228874 - 3 * (0.000548579909) = 6.0134771477 u.\n    *   Next, we convert this mass from atomic mass units (u) to energy in Mega-electron Volts (MeV) using the conversion factor $1 \\text{ u} \\approx 931.4941 \\text{ MeV/c}^2$.\n        *   Rest Energy ($E_0$) = $6.0134771477 \\text{ u} \\times 931.4941 \\text{ MeV/u} \\approx 5601.26 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E):**\n    *   Now, we combine the Lorentz factor and the rest energy:\n        $E = \\gamma \\times E_0$\n        $E \\approx 3.57142857 \\times 5601.26 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 20004.5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n6.  **Convert to Final Units and Compare:**\n    *   The options are given in Giga-electron Volts (GeV).

The minor difference (~0.6%) is likely due to the use of slightly different physical constants or rounding in the velocity value (e.g., the calculation for the options may have used v=0.9605c, which was then rounded to 0.96c in the problem text).\n\nTo verify the precise values, we use the following Python code:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants from CODATA 2018 and NIST\nu_to_MeV = 931.49410242  # Conversion factor from atomic mass units to MeV/c^2\nmass_Li6_atom = 6.0151228874  # Atomic mass of Lithium-6 in u\nmass_electron = 0.000548579909  # Electron rest mass in u\n\n# Given speed\nv_over_c = 0.96\n\n# 1.

    "Thank you for providing the output. My analysis confirms your calculation. The small variations in the last decimal places often arise from using slightly different values for physical constants (like the `u_to_MeV` conversion factor). However, the core result is consistent.\n\nHere is the definitive step-by-step solution based on your provided output of **20.0054 GeV**.\n\n### 1. Identify the Particle and Conditions\n*   **Nucleus:** Lithium-6 ($^{6}\\text{Li}$), which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n*   **Velocity:** The nucleus is moving at a speed of $v = 0.96c$.\n\n### 2. State the Physical Principle\nThe total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by Einstein's energy-mass-momentum relation:\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\nWhere:\n*   $E_0 = m_0 c^2$ is the rest energy of the nucleus.\n*   $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, determined by the velocity.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**a. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated from the velocity:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\nGiven $v/c = 0.96$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.28}$\n$\\gamma \\approx 3.5714$\n\n**b. Calculate the Rest Energy ($E_0$)**\nThe rest energy is derived from the rest mass of the $^{6}\\text{Li}$ nucleus. We must use the nuclear mass, not the atomic mass (which includes electrons).\n*   Atomic mass of $^{6}\\text{Li}$: ~6.01512 u\n*   Mass of 3 electrons: 3 * ~0.00055 u ≈ 0.00165 u\n*   Mass of $^{6}\\text{Li}$ nucleus ($m_0$): ~6.01512 u - 0.00165 u ≈ 6.01347 u\nUsing a common conversion factor ($1 \\text{ u} \\approx 931.5 \\text{ MeV/c}^2$):\n*   Rest Energy ($E_0$) ≈ $6.01347 \\text{ u} \\times 931.5 \\text{ MeV/u} \\approx 5601.55 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**c. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\nNow we combine the Lorentz factor and the rest energy:\n*   $E = \\gamma \\times E_0$\n*   $E \\approx 3.5714 \\times 5601.55 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 20005.5 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**d. Convert to Final Units (GeV)**\nThe final answer needs to be in Giga-electron Volts (GeV). We divide the result in MeV by 1000:\n*   $E \\approx 20005.5 \\text{ MeV} / 1000 = 20.0055 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe calculation gives a total energy of approximately **20.0055 GeV**. Your provided output of **20.0054 GeV** is in excellent agreement with this result.\n\nNow, we compare this calculated value to the given multiple-choice options:\nA) 21.419 GeV\nB) 20.132 GeV\nC) 18.475 GeV\nD) 23.069 GeV\n\nThe calculated value (~20.01 GeV) is closest to **B) 20.132 GeV**. The small difference (about 0.6%) is most likely because the velocity given in the problem (`0.96c`) was a rounded value, and the option was calculated with a more precise velocity (e.g., ~0.9605c). Among the available choices, B is the only physically plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
