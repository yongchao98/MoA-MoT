    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the lifetime of a quantum state (Δt) to the uncertainty or \"width\" of its energy level (ΔE). The principle is given by the relation:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For practical purposes in spectroscopy and lifetime measurements, this is often approximated as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n\nHere, ΔE represents the natural linewidth or the inherent uncertainty in the energy of the state, and Δt is its lifetime (τ).\n\nTo clearly resolve or distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E2 - E1|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. A conservative condition is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the widths of the two levels:\n\n|E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy width (uncertainty) for each state.\n\n**1.

Determine the minimum energy difference for resolution:**\nThe total width that needs to be overcome is the sum of the individual widths:\n*   Total width = ΔE1 + ΔE2\n*   Total width ≈ (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n*   Total width ≈ (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   Total width ≈ 7.238 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, to be clearly resolved, the energy difference |E2 - E1| must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**5.

    "The problem requires us to determine a possible energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be clearly resolved, given their respective lifetimes. This is an application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n2.  **Lifetime and Energy Width:** The lifetime (τ) of an unstable quantum state can be interpreted as the time interval Δt during which the state exists. This finite lifetime leads to an inherent uncertainty, or \"width\" (ΔE), in the state's energy level. A shorter lifetime implies a larger energy width, meaning the energy is less precisely defined. For practical calculations, we use the approximation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Condition for Resolution:** To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, E1 and E2, the difference in their energies (|E2 - E1|) must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. A standard criterion is that the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2).\n    |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n4.  **Constants and Given Values:**\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ1) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ2) = 10⁻⁸ s\n\n5.  **Calculations:**\n    *   **Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1):**\n        ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2):**\n        ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n    *   **Minimum energy difference for resolution:**\n        Required difference > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n        Required difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n        Required difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n        Required difference > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** We need to find the option that is greater than ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (<< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV   (<< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV   (<< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV   (>> 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n    Only option C provides an energy separation that is substantially larger than the combined energy widths, which would allow the two levels to be clearly resolved.\n\nI will use Python to confirm the calculation.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV.s\nhbar = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state\ndelta_E1 = hbar / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar / tau2\n\n# The condition for resolvability is that the energy difference\n# should be greater than the sum of the widths.\nmin_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum required energy difference (ΔE1 + ΔE2): {min_energy_difference:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-9,\n    \"C\": 1e-4,\n    \"D\": 1e-8\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > min_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) could be the energy difference for the levels to be clearly resolved.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is too small for the levels to be clearly resolved.\")\n```\nEnergy width of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.582e-08 eV\nMinimum required energy difference (ΔE1 + ΔE2): 7.240e-07 eV\n\nComparing with options:\nOption A (1.0e-11 eV) is too small for the levels to be clearly resolved.\nOption B (1.0e-09 eV) is too small for the levels to be clearly resolved.\nOption C (1.0e-04 eV) could be the energy difference for the levels to be clearly resolved.\nOption D (1.0e-08 eV) is too small for the levels to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The provided information and my analysis both point to the same conclusion.\n\n1.  **Understand the Principle:** The core concept is the time-energy uncertainty principle (ΔE⋅Δt ≥ ħ/2). A state with a finite lifetime (τ = Δt) has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE ≈ ħ/τ).\n2.  **Calculate Energy Widths:**\n    *   For the first state with τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s, the energy width is ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / 10⁻⁹ s ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   For the second state with τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s, the energy width is ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / 10⁻⁸ s ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n3.  **Determine Resolution Condition:** To resolve two energy levels, the separation between them must be greater than the sum of their widths. This is analogous to the Rayleigh criterion in optics for resolving two light sources.\n    *   Required energy separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   Required energy separation > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:** We need to find the option that is greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV\n5.  **Conclusion:** Comparing the values, only 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than the required minimum separation of 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The other options are all smaller than the required separation, meaning the energy levels would overlap too much to be distinguished.\n\nThe code execution confirms this calculation precisely. The minimum required difference is 7.240e-07 eV, and only option C (1.0e-04 eV) is greater than this value.\n\n<<<C>>>"
