    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is:\n    T_eq = [ (L_star * (1 - A)) / (16 * π * σ * a²) ]^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   L_star is the luminosity of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2. Since both planets orbit the same star (L_star is constant) and the problem states they have the same albedo (A4 = A2), most terms in the formula will cancel out.\n    T_eq ∝ (1 / a²)^(1/4)\n    T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2) or T_eq ∝ 1/√a\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1/√a4) / (1/√a2) = √(a2 / a4)\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period:** To find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a4), we use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which states that the square of the orbital period (P or T) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit.\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This implies: a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n5.  **Express the Semi-Major Axis Ratio in Terms of Period Ratio:** Using the relationship from Kepler's Third Law, we can write the ratio of the semi-major axes as:\n    a2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio Equation:** Now, substitute the expression for (a2 / a4) back into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = √[ (P2 / P4)^(2/3) ]\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem gives the ratio of the orbital periods as P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we can find the specific ratio for Planet 2 and Planet 4:\n    P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the period ratio into the final equation and calculate the result.\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the numerical value, we can use a calculator:\n    4 / 7 ≈ 0.571428\n    (0.571428)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298...\n\n    This value is approximately 0.83.\n\n```python\n# Python code to calculate the final value precisely.\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is (P2/P4)^(1/3).\n# The ratio of the periods P2:P4 is 2:3.5.\n\n# Calculate the ratio P2/P4\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# Calculate the final temperature ratio, which is the cube root of the period ratio.\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n```output\n0.8298013628799335\n```\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.83, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of an exoplanet is given by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nFor two planets orbiting the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is:\n\nT_eq_planet_a / T_eq_planet_b = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_a)) * (1 - A_a)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_b)) * (1 - A_b)^(1/4)]\n\nSince the planets orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are constant) and they have the same albedo (A_a = A_b), the formula simplifies to:\n\nT_eq_a / T_eq_b = sqrt(a_b / a_a)\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2, so:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a4)\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n\nP² ∝ a³  or  a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes can be expressed in terms of the ratio of the orbital periods:\n\na2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)\n\nNow, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (P2 / P4)^(2/3) )\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = ( (P2 / P4)^(2/3) )^(1/2)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of the orbital periods as P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nFrom this, the ratio P2 / P4 is 2 / 3.5.\n\nNow, we calculate the final value:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298\n\nThe result ~0.83 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
