    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and calculation process to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\nThe problem involves a solution of a Ca-EDTA complex. This complex, while stable, exists in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($EDTA^{4-}$). The equilibrium reaction for the *formation* of the complex is:\n\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\nThe problem is asking for the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ ions, which are formed from the *dissociation* of the complex. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Use the Formation Constant (K_f)**\n\nThe problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$), which is a measure of how strongly the complex is formed.\n$K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nThe equilibrium expression for the formation is:\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}$\n\n**3. Set up an ICE Table**\n\nTo find the equilibrium concentrations, we use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the dissociation reaction. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :-------------: |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   |    0.02     |     -x     |     0.02 - x    |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           |      0      |     +x     |        x        |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         |      0      |     +x     |        x        |\n\n**4. Solve for x**\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n\n$5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n**5. Apply an Approximation**\n\nThe formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is extremely large. This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction, meaning very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be a very small number compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n\nWe can simplify the equation by assuming that `(0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02`.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Concentration of Calcium Ions ([Ca^{2+}])**\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ at equilibrium.\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n$x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n\nTake the square root of both sides to find x:\n$x = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}}$\n\nTo perform the calculation precisely, we can use a simple Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# The simplified equation is x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\n\n# x is the concentration of Ca2+ ions\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n```output\n6.32e-07\n```\nThe calculated value for x is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This value is indeed much smaller than 0.02, confirming our initial approximation was valid.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 6.3x10^-7 M\nB) 5.0x10^-3 M\nC) 2.0x10^-2 M\nD) 1.0x10^-2 M\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution containing the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium:**\nThe Ca-EDTA complex, `[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}`, is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n\nThe dissociation reaction is:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Relate the Dissociation to the Formation Constant (K_f):**\nThe problem gives the formation constant, $K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$. The equilibrium expression for this constant corresponds to the formation reaction:\n\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n**3. Set up an ICE Table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):**\nWe start with 0.02 M of the complex, and we want to find how much of it dissociates. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---------------------|:-----------:|:----------:|:---------------:|\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   |    0.02     |     -x     |     0.02 - x    |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           |      0      |     +x     |        x        |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         |      0      |     +x     |        x        |\n\n**4. Substitute Equilibrium Concentrations into the Expression:**\nPlug the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant equation:\n\n$5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n**5. Simplify the Equation:**\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is extremely large, the equilibrium strongly favors the complex. This means that a very small amount of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\nWe can make the valid approximation that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n**6. Solve for x:**\nNow, we solve for 'x', which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions at equilibrium.\n\nRearrange the equation:\n$x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n$x = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}}$\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is x, which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
