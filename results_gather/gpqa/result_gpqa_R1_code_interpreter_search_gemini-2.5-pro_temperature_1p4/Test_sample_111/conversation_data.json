    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalization of the state `|alpha>`\n\nThe state of the electron is given as being proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`. Let's call the unnormalized state `|psi>`:\n`|psi> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`\n\nIn the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, where `|up>` is `(1, 0)` and `|down>` is `(0, 1)`, the state vector is:\n`|psi> = [1+i, 2-i]`\n\nTo normalize this state, we need to find its norm and divide by it. The squared norm `<psi|psi>` is calculated as:\n`<psi|psi> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)`\n`<psi|psi> = (1² - i²) + (2² - i²) = (1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1)) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant is `1/sqrt(7)`. Therefore, the normalized state `|alpha>` is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\n\n### 2. Finding the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of the Operator A\n\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements `Aij`, where `Aij = hbar/2` for `i != j` and `Aii = 0`. In the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, this gives the matrix:\n`A = [[A11, A12], [A21, A22]] = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis is `(hbar/2)` times the Pauli-X matrix, `sigma_x`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`lambda`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - lambda*I) = 0`:\n`det([[ -lambda, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -lambda ]]) = (-lambda)(-lambda) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = lambda² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\n`lambda_1 = +hbar/2`\n`lambda_2 = -hbar/2`\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates (eigenvectors):\nFor `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`:\n`(A - lambda_1*I)v = 0 => [[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] * [[x], [y]] = 0`\nThis leads to the equation `-x + y = 0`, or `x = y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]`. Normalizing it gives the eigenstate `|v1>`:\n`|v1> = (1/sqrt(1²+1²)) * [1, 1] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`\n\nFor `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`:\n`(A - lambda_2*I)v = 0 => [[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]] * [[x], [y]] = 0`\nThis leads to the equation `x + y = 0`, or `x = -y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]`. Normalizing it gives the eigenstate `|v2>`:\n`|v2> = (1/sqrt(1²+(-1)²)) * [1, -1] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `lambda_k` is given by `P(lambda_k) = |<v_k|alpha>|²`.\n\nProbability of measuring `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`:\n`P₁ = |<v1|alpha>|²`\n`<v1|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n`<v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)] = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1+i+2-i) = 3/sqrt(14)`\n`P₁ = |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\nProbability of measuring `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`:\n`P₂ = |<v2|alpha>|²`\n`<v2|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n`<v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)] = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1+i-2+i) = (-1+2i)/sqrt(14)`\n`P₂ = |(-1+2i)/sqrt(14)|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nAs a check, `P₁ + P₂ = 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`.\nThe probabilities are approximately `0.64` and `0.36`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Average Value of the Operator A\n\nThe average (or expectation) value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways:\n\nMethod 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities\n`<A> = P₁*lambda_1 + P₂*lambda_2`\n`<A> = (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2) = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\nMethod 2: Using the definition `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`\n`<A> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n`<A> = (hbar/14) * [1-i, 2+i] * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n`<A> = (hbar/14) * [1-i, 2+i] * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n`<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n`<A> = (hbar/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)] = (hbar/14) * [1 + 1] = 2*hbar/14 = hbar/7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are `9/14 ≈ 0.64` and `5/14 ≈ 0.36`, and the average value is `hbar/7`. This matches the values given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
