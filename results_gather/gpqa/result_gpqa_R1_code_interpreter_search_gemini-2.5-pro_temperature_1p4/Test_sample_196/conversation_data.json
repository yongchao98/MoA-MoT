    "**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (Compound X) from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The broad absorption in the range **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of C=C stretching from an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm) are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded. The protons at 7.2 ppm are *ortho* to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals describe the second substituent on the benzene ring. Let's piece them together:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons represents a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂). This is the end of a chain: -CH₂-**CH₃**.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons represents a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-). This is a branching point: -CH(**CH₃**)-.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-**CH₂**-) adjacent to both the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and the methine group at 2.9 ppm.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-**CH**-). Its chemical shift indicates it is benzylic (directly attached to the benzene ring). It is coupled to the methyl group at 1.4 ppm and the methylene group at 1.7 ppm.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Combining these fragments gives a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:**\n    Based on all the data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (A).\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of several oxygen-containing functional groups.\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Carboxylic Acid (-COOH):** Red P/HI reduces a carboxylic acid group completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Benzene Ring:** The aromatic ring is very stable and will not be reduced under these conditions.\n    *   **Alkyl Group:** The sec-butyl group is an alkane chain and is unreactive to these reagents.\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\n*   The reaction starts with 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n*   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n*   The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   The final product is therefore **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**4. Matching with Options**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our deduced product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n\nThe correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
