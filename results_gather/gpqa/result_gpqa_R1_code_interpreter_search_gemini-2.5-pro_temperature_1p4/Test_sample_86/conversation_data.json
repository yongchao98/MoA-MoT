    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two substituents (C6H4). The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. This means the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is F, Cl, Br, or I).\n*   **Conclusion on Substituents:** One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). The other substituent must contain the C=O group and the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n\n**2. Identify Possible Structures:**\n\nLet's determine the structure of the second substituent, which has 2 carbons and a C=O group.\n*   **Possibility 1: Acetyl group (-COCH3).** This group has 2 carbons and a C=O. If this group and a halogen are attached to the benzene ring, we get a halo-acetophenone. The molecular formula would be C8H7OX. This fits all the criteria.\n*   **Possibility 2: Phenylacetaldehyde-like group (-CH2CHO).** This group has 2 carbons and a C=O. If this group and a halogen are attached to the ring, we get a halo-phenylacetaldehyde. The molecular formula would be C8H7OX. This also fits all criteria.\n*   **Possibility 3: Phenylacetic acid-like group (-CH2COOH).** This fits the C, C=O, and Ar-X criteria. However, the acidic proton (-COOH) would typically appear as a very broad singlet far downfield (>10 ppm), which isn't reflected in most options.\n*   **Possibility 4: Ester group like methyl halo-benzoate (-COOCH3).** Here the halogen is on the ring. The substituents would be -X and -COOCH3. This has C6(ring) + C(carbonyl) + C(methyl) = 8 carbons. It has a C=O and Ar-X bond. This is also a valid candidate structure.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options based on Predicted Spectra:**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the most likely structures, particularly considering the common para (1,4) substitution pattern which leads to a simple, recognizable spectrum with high symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure 1: p-Haloacetophenone (Ar-COCH3)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The 1,4-disubstitution creates symmetry. The 4 aromatic protons will appear as two distinct sets of 2 protons each.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** We expect two doublets, each integrating to 2H. Because the -COCH3 group is a strong electron-withdrawing group directly attached to the ring, these protons will be significantly deshielded and appear in the 7.5-8.0 ppm range.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The -CH3 group is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Thus, it will be a singlet. Its chemical shift is typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** Two doublets (2H each) in the aromatic region, and one singlet (3H) around 2.3 ppm.\n\n*   **Structure 2: p-Halophenylacetaldehyde (Ar-CH2CHO)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Also 1,4-disubstituted, so two sets of aromatic protons.\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (1H):** The -CHO proton is highly characteristic, appearing as a singlet in the 9-10 ppm range.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Two doublets (2H each). The -CH2CHO group is electron-withdrawing, but the effect is moderated by the insulating -CH2- group. The chemical shifts would be lower (more upfield) than for p-haloacetophenone.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (2H):** The -CH2- protons are between the aromatic ring and the carbonyl carbon (which has no H), so they would appear as a singlet around 3.5-4.0 ppm.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** One singlet (1H) at ~9-10 ppm, two doublets (2H each) in the aromatic region, and one singlet (2H) around 3.7 ppm.\n\n*   **Structure 3: Methyl p-halobenzoate (Ar-COOCH3)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** 1,4-disubstituted.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Two doublets (2H each) in the aromatic region, similar to p-haloacetophenone, in the 7.5-8.1 ppm range.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The ester methyl group (-OCH3) is a singlet, with a typical chemical shift of ~3.9 ppm.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** Two doublets (2H each) in the aromatic region, and one singlet (3H) around 3.9 ppm.\n\n**4. Match Predictions to the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect number of aromatic protons (only 1H shown) and incorrect splitting patterns for a simple di-substituted benzene ring. Does not match any likely structure.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Completely lacks signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This is impossible for a compound containing a benzene ring.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Two doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each for 2H. This is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** A singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3H. This is perfectly characteristic of an acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for **p-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for **p-halophenylacetaldehyde**. The signal at 9.9 ppm is the aldehyde proton, the two doublets are the aromatic protons, and the singlet at 3.7 ppm is the -CH2- group.\n\n**5. Final Decision between C and D:**\n\nBoth options C and D represent valid chemical structures that fit the initial description. However, this is a multiple-choice question, and only one answer can be correct. In educational and testing contexts, problems are often designed around the most common or representative examples. Halo-acetophenones (structure for C) are arguably more common textbook examples than halo-phenylacetaldehydes (structure for D). Furthermore, the chemical shifts in option C (7.8, 7.6, 2.3 ppm) are textbook values for a p-substituted acetophenone. Without further information to distinguish between the two isomers, we choose the option that represents the well-known and perfectly matching spectral data for p-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
