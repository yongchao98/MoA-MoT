    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about the structure (rings or double bonds).\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests the presence of one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O), given the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct bands in the 3300-3500 cm-1 region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2 group). One band is for the asymmetric N-H stretch and the other for the symmetric N-H stretch.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. A value around 1720 cm-1 is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shifts between the two doublets indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the signature pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3). The methyl group (-CH3) at 1.20 ppm is split into a triplet by the adjacent 2 protons of the methylene group. The methylene group (-CH2-) at 4.5 ppm is split into a quartet by the adjacent 3 protons of the methyl group. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, to form an ethoxy group (-O-CH2-CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This signal is consistent with the primary amine (-NH2) protons identified in the IR spectrum. The protons are on a nitrogen atom, and their signal is often broad due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar broadening. Its position is consistent with an aromatic amine.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group.\n    3.  The other substituent contains the ethoxy group (-O-CH2-CH3) and a carbonyl group (C=O). Combining these gives an ethyl ester group, -C(=O)OCH2CH3. This is an electron-withdrawing group.\n    4.  Placing these two groups on the 1,4-disubstituted ring gives the structure: 4-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, or **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    5.  Let's verify this structure against the data:\n        *   **Structure:** Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n        *   **Formula:** C9H11NO2. (Matches).\n        *   **IR:** Has a primary amine (-NH2) and an ester (C=O). (Matches).\n        *   **NMR:**\n            *   The electron-donating -NH2 group shields its ortho protons, which appear as the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n            *   The electron-withdrawing -COOEt group deshields its ortho protons, which appear as the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n            *   The signals for the ethyl group and the amine protons are all accounted for. (Matches).\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (-COCH2CH3), not an ethoxy group. The methylene quartet would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is an amide, not a primary amine, so it would only have one N-H proton and one N-H stretch in the IR. It would also show a signal for a formyl proton (-CHO) above 8 ppm.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets. Also, it is an amide, and the NH2 protons would likely appear further downfield.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
