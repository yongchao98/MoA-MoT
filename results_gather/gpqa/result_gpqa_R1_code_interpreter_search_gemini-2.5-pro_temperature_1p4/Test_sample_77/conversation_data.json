    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Setup**\n    *   We have a point charge `q` moving along a path described by the vector function `s(t)`.\n    *   We want to find the electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, at a specific observation point `r` and at a specific time `t`.\n    *   Electromagnetic signals (and thus the influence of the charge) travel at the speed of light, `c`. This means the potentials at `(r, t)` are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, called the *retarded time*, `tr`.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is the time at which the signal must have been emitted from the charge's position `s(tr)` to reach the observation point `r` at time `t`. The relationship is given by:\n        `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n\n2.  **Defining Key Vectors and Quantities**\n    *   **Source position at retarded time:** `s(tr)`.\n    *   **Vector from source to observer:** The problem defines this vector as `d`. So, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n    *   **Distance from source to observer:** The magnitude of this vector is `d = |d|`.\n    *   **Velocity of the charge at retarded time:** `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n    *   The retarded time condition can be rewritten using our notation: `t - tr = d / c`.\n\n3.  **Retarded Potential Integrals**\n    For a general time-varying charge density `rho(r', t')` and current density `J(r', t')`, the retarded potentials are given by:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πϵo) ∫ [rho(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    `A(r, t) = (μo / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    where `tr = t - |r - r'|/c` is the retarded time for each source point `r'`.\n\n4.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a point charge `q` moving along `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    *   `rho(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n    *   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\n    Substituting these into the potential integrals is complex because the retarded time `tr` in the argument of the delta function also depends on the integration variable `r'`. A standard, but non-trivial, evaluation of these integrals (found in advanced electromagnetism textbooks like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\") yields the following results, known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**:\n\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πϵo) * [q / (d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c))]_ret`\n    `A(r, t) = (μo / 4π) * [q * v / (d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c))]_ret`\n\n    The `_ret` subscript signifies that all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, `d̂`, `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n    Here, `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded source position to the observation point.\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Expressions**\n    Let's focus on the denominator term:\n    `d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c) = d * (1 - ( (d/d) ⋅ v )/c) = d - (d ⋅ v)/c`\n\n    Now, substitute this simplified denominator back into the potential equations:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πϵo) * [q / (d - (d ⋅ v)/c)]`\n\n    To match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πϵo) * [qc / (dc - d ⋅ v)]`\n\n    Similarly, for the vector potential `A`:\n    `A(r, t) = (μo / 4π) * [q * v / (d - (d ⋅ v)/c)]`\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    `A(r, t) = (μo / 4π) * [qc * v / (dc - d ⋅ v)]`\n\n6.  **Comparing with the Given Options**\n\n    Let's examine the options provided:\n    *   A) Incorrect form for V (static potential) and incorrect relation for A.\n    *   B) Same form as our result, but with a `+` sign in the denominator (`dc + d.v`). This is incorrect; the sign is `-`. The sign accounts for the Doppler-like effect; when the charge moves towards the observer (`d.v` > 0), the denominator becomes smaller, and the potential stronger.\n    *   C) Incorrect form for V (static potential). While the relation `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for `V` itself is wrong.\n    *   D) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πεo * (dc - d⋅v))` and `A(r,t) = μo qc v / (4π * (dc - d⋅v))`.\n\n    These expressions exactly match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The notation in the option matches the standard derivation perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
