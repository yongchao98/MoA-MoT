    "To solve this problem, we need to compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2.\n\n**1. Transit Probability Formula**\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star, assuming a circular orbit and a random inclination, is given by the formula:\n   `p_transit = R_s / a`\nwhere:\n*   `R_s` is the radius of the host star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the probability of Planet_1 transiting to the probability of Planet_2 transiting:\n   `Ratio = p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\nThis can be rewritten as:\n   `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n**2. Using the Given Information**\nFrom the problem description, we have the following relationships:\n*   The radii of the host stars are the same: `R_s1 = R_s2`. Therefore, `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n*   The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3`.\n\nSubstituting `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1` into our ratio equation, we get:\n   `Ratio = a_2 / a_1`\n\nThis means the ratio of the transit probabilities is simply the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**3. Applying Kepler's Third Law**\nTo find the relationship between `a_1` and `a_2`, we use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. For a planet orbiting a star, where the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass (`M_p << M_s`), the law can be written as:\n   `P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_s`\nRearranging this to solve for the semi-major axis `a`, we get:\n   `a^3 ∝ M_s * P^2`\n   `a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n   `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2^2)^(1/3) ] / [ (M_s1 * P_1^2)^(1/3) ]`\n   `a_2 / a_1 = ( (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (M_s1 * P_1^2) )^(1/3)`\n\n**4. Calculation**\nLet's substitute the known relationships (`M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` and `P_1 = P_2 / 3`) into this equation:\n   `a_2 / a_1 = ( (M_s2 * P_2^2) / ( (2 * M_s2) * (P_2 / 3)^2 ) )^(1/3)`\n   `a_2 / a_1 = ( (M_s2 * P_2^2) / ( 2 * M_s2 * P_2^2 / 9 ) )^(1/3)`\n\nThe `M_s2` and `P_2^2` terms cancel out:\n   `a_2 / a_1 = ( 1 / (2 / 9) )^(1/3)`\n   `a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n   `a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nNow we compute the value:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the cube root of 4.5\nvalue = (4.5)**(1/3)\nprint(value)\n```\n```output\n1.650964010377469\n```\nSo, `a_2 / a_1 ≈ 1.65`.\n\nSince the probability ratio `p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 = a_2 / a_1`, we have:\n   `p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 ≈ 1.65`\n\nThis result means that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks us to determine which of two exoplanets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting its host star and by what factor.\n\n**1. Transit Probability Formula**\n\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`), assuming a circular orbit and random inclination:\n`p_transit = R_s / a`\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to that of Planet_2:\n`Ratio = p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n`Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n**2. Using the Given Information**\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know:\n*   The radii of the host stars are the same: `R_s1 = R_s2`. This means the ratio `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is one-third that of Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3`.\n*   The mass of Planet_1's host star is twice that of Planet_2's host star: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n\nSubstituting `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1` into our probability ratio formula, we get:\n`Ratio = p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 = a_2 / a_1`\n\nThis tells us that the ratio of the transit probabilities is the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes. To find this ratio, we need to relate the semi-major axis to the given parameters (period and stellar mass).\n\n**3. Applying Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`) and inversely proportional to the mass of its host star (`M_s`). We can write this as a proportionality:\n`P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_s`\n\nRearranging to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n`a^3 ∝ M_s * P^2`\n`a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2^2)^(1/3) ] / [ (M_s1 * P_1^2)^(1/3) ]`\n`a_2 / a_1 = ( (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (M_s1 * P_1^2) )^(1/3)`\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nLet's substitute the relationships `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` and `P_1 = P_2 / 3` into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = ( (M_s2 * P_2^2) / ( (2 * M_s2) * (P_2 / 3)^2 ) )^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = ( (M_s2 * P_2^2) / ( 2 * M_s2 * P_2^2 / 9 ) )^(1/3)`\n\nThe `M_s2` and `P_2^2` terms cancel out, leaving:\n`a_2 / a_1 = ( 1 / (2/9) )^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nUsing the provided code output:\n`a_2 / a_1 ≈ 1.65096`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nSince the probability ratio is `p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 = a_2 / a_1`, we have:\n`p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 ≈ 1.65`\n\nThis result shows that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
