    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n    The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta n$: any integer change is possible.\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Cascade Path**\n    *   **Direct Transition:** A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden by the E1 selection rules because $\\Delta l = 0-0 = 0$. While other transition types exist (like magnetic dipole M1), they are much weaker. The problem specifies the decay happens via two dipole transitions, confirming we should consider a cascade.\n\n    *   **First Transition:** The atom must decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n        *   For a decay process (photon emission), the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number of the intermediate state must be $n' < 3$.\n        *   The possible values for $n'$ are 1 and 2. However, a state with $n'=1$ and $l'=1$ (a '1p' state) does not exist in the hydrogen atom model.\n        *   Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$ and $l'=1$. This corresponds to the $2p$ orbital.\n        *   Applying the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ to the initial state with $m=0$, the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state can be $m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n        *   So, the first transition leads to one of the three degenerate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** The atom then decays from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check the selection rules: $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n        *   The change in magnetic quantum number is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This results in $\\Delta m=0$ if $m'=0$, $\\Delta m=-1$ if $m'=1$, and $\\Delta m=+1$ if $m'=-1$. All these changes are allowed by the selection rules.\n\n    *   **Possible Routes:** We have identified three possible cascade routes:\n        1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n    The probability of the atom taking a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The total transition rate from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a set of final states $\\{|f_k\\rangle\\}$ is the sum of the individual rates $A_{i \\rightarrow f_k}$. The branching ratio for a specific final state $|f_j\\rangle$ is $A_{i \\rightarrow f_j} / \\sum_k A_{i \\rightarrow f_k}$.\n\n    The transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element $|\\langle f|\\mathbf{r}|i\\rangle|^2$. We need to compare the rates for the three possible first transitions: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$ for $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (it is an $s$-orbital). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the three degenerate sub-levels of the $2p$ orbital ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) must be equally probable.\n\n    A more rigorous calculation using the Wigner-Eckart theorem confirms this intuition. The transition probability from $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $|\\langle l, 1; m, m'-m | l', m' \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   For our first transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$, we have $l=0, m=0$ and $l'=1, m'=m'$.\n    *   The relevant coefficient is $\\langle 0, 1; 0, m' | 1, m' \\rangle$. For any allowed value of $m'$ (-1, 0, or 1), this coefficient is equal to 1.\n    *   Since the square of the coefficient is 1 for all three cases, the transition rates are equal.\n\n    Since the three possible decay channels for the first step have equal rates, the probability is distributed evenly among them.\n    *   Total number of paths = 3.\n    *   Probability for each path = $1/3$.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculated path and probability.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a possible route and its corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
