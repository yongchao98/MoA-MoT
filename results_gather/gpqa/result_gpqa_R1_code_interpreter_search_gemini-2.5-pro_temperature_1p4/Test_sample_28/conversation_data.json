    "An effective way to eliminate an unwanted compound produced by a gene is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the resulting protein. The process of protein synthesis, called translation, reads the DNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides, called codons. Translation starts at the `ATG` start codon and continues until it reaches a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`).\n\n**Intact Gene Analysis:**\n- DNA sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’`\n- Let's break it down into codons and translate them to amino acids:\n  - `ATG`: Methionine (Start)\n  - `TTT`: Phenylalanine\n  - `CTC`: Leucine\n  - `GCT`: Alanine\n  - `GGT`: Glycine\n  - ...and so on, until the `TGA` stop codon.\n- The result is a full-length, functional protein that synthesizes the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**Analysis of Mutants:**\n\nTo determine the most effective mutation, we look for one that causes the most drastic change to the protein, ideally leading to a complete loss of function. A **nonsense mutation**, which introduces a premature stop codon, is the most likely to achieve this. It causes translation to halt, producing a severely shortened and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n\nLet's examine the codons in each mutant at the site of the changes:\n\n- **Intact codons:** `ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` ...\n\n- **Mutant 1:**\n  - Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ...`\n  - Codons: `ATG` `TTC` `TAC` ...\n  - Changes: `TTT` -> `TTC` (Phenylalanine -> Phenylalanine, a silent mutation) and `CTC` -> `TAC` (Leucine -> Tyrosine, a missense mutation).\n  - Effect: One amino acid is changed in the protein. This might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n- **Mutant 2:**\n  - Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ...`\n  - Codons: `ATG` `TTC` `TAA` ...\n  - Changes: `TTT` -> `TTC` (Phenylalanine -> Phenylalanine, a silent mutation) and `CTC` -> `TAA` (Leucine -> **STOP codon**).\n  - Effect: This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon signals the ribosome to stop translation. The resulting \"protein\" would only be two amino acids long (Methionine-Phenylalanine). This truncated product will be non-functional, thus eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n- **Mutant 3:**\n  - Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n  - Codons: `ATG` `TTT` `TAC` `GCT` `GGT` `GTC`...\n  - Changes: `CTC` -> `TAC` (Leucine -> Tyrosine) and `ACT` -> `GTC` (Threonine -> Valine).\n  - Effect: These are two missense mutations, changing two amino acids in the protein. Like Mutant 1, this might affect function but is less certain to eliminate it than a premature stop codon.\n\n- **Mutant 4:**\n  - Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n  - Changes: Comparing the full strings (`...CTCGCTGGTACT...` vs `...TTACGCTACT...`), this appears to be a complex mutation involving substitutions and deletions. The most plausible interpretation is `CTC`->`TAC` (a missense mutation) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon (which removes a Glycine amino acid).\n  - Effect: The protein has one amino acid changed and another one deleted. While this is a significant change, it is still less disruptive than a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 is the only one that introduces a premature stop codon. This nonsense mutation will truncate protein synthesis almost immediately, which is the most probable way among the given options to create a non-functional protein and thus eliminate the unwanted compound.\n\n```python\ndef translate(dna_sequence):\n    \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence.\"\"\"\n    codon_table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M',\n        'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\n        'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L',\n        'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q',\n        'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\n        'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S',\n        'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'_STOP_', 'TAG':'_STOP_',\n        'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'_STOP_', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n    protein = \"\"\n    # Process the sequence in chunks of 3 (codons)\n    for i in range(0, len(dna_sequence) - (len(dna_sequence) % 3), 3):\n        codon = dna_sequence[i:i+3]\n        amino_acid = codon_table.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown codon\n        if amino_acid == '_STOP_':\n            protein += amino_acid\n            break\n        protein += amino_acid\n    return protein\n\nintact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\nmutant_1 = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\nmutant_2 = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n# The provided sequences for mutant 3 and 4 have typos or complex mutations that make direct codon comparison difficult.\n# Let's use the codon differences inferred from the context of the question for clarity.\n# Inferred Mutant 3 (two missense): CTC->TAC and ACT->GTC\nmutant_3_inferred = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTACTGTCGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n# Inferred Mutant 4 (missense + deletion): CTC->TAC and delete GGT\nmutant_4_inferred = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\n\nprint(f\"Intact gene: 5'-{intact_gene[:30]}...\")\nprint(f\"Translation:   {translate(intact_gene)}\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"Mutant 1:    5'-{mutant_1[:30]}...\")\nprint(f\"Translation:   {translate(mutant_1)}\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"Mutant 2:    5'-{mutant_2[:30]}...\")\nprint(f\"Translation:   {translate(mutant_2)}\\n\")\n\n# Comparing the first 9 codons of the original sequence:\n# Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT\n# CTC -> TAA would introduce a stop codon.\n# This corresponds to Mutant 2, where the sequence is ATG TTC TAA...
