    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n**1. Analyze the role of Gene G2.**\n*   A knock-out of gene G2 (`g2` mutant) results in 0% resistance. This means G2 is absolutely essential for any resistance to occur.\n*   Let's examine the double mutants involving `g2`.\n    *   `g1g2` double mutant: 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant, not the `g1` single mutant (75%). When the phenotype of a double mutant is the same as one of the single mutants, the corresponding gene (`g2` in this case) is said to be **epistatic** to the other gene (`g1`). This means G2 acts upstream of G1 in the genetic pathway.\n    *   `g2g3` double mutant: 0% resistance. Similarly, this phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant, not the `g3` single mutant (50%). This means G2 is also epistatic to G3, placing it upstream of G3 as well.\n*   **Conclusion 1:** G2 acts upstream of both G1 and G3. Since the problem states one gene is a transcription factor (a regulator that acts upstream), **G2 is the transcription factor**. This eliminates option D, which claims G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n**2. Analyze the relationship between Gene G1 and Gene G3.**\n*   G1 knockout (`g1`) leads to 75% resistance (a 25% loss).\n*   G3 knockout (`g3`) leads to 50% resistance (a 50% loss).\n*   Both genes clearly contribute to the resistance phenotype.\n*   Now, let's look at the `g1g3` double mutant. It has 10% resistance.\n*   If the genes acted independently in an additive way, we would expect the resistance to be roughly 100% - (25% loss from g1) - (50% loss from g3) = 25%.\n*   The actual result is 10%, which is significantly lower than the expected additive result. This indicates a **synergistic interaction**. The loss of both genes has a much greater negative impact than the sum of their individual losses.\n*   This synergistic relationship suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to the same biological function (resistance) through parallel or overlapping mechanisms. This concept, where multiple genes contribute to the same function, providing robustness to the system, is known as **gene redundancy**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the remaining options (A, B, C).**\n*   All three options correctly identify G2 as the transcription factor.\n*   We need to differentiate them based on their description of the G1-G3 relationship.\n    *   **Option A:** Suggests they have the \"same promoter\" and \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\". \"Same promoter\" is plausible if both are regulated by G2, but it's a structural feature that isn't directly proven by this experiment. The epistasis claim is false because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n    *   **Option C:** Suggests \"pleiotropy\" and \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. This experiment only measures one trait (resistance), so we cannot conclude anything about pleiotropy. The epistasis claim is false because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n    *   **Option B:** Suggests \"gene redundancy\" and \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". As discussed in step 2, \"gene redundancy\" is the best functional description for the synergistic relationship observed between G1 and G3. The claim \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is factually incorrect based on the data, just as in option C.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion.**\n*   Option B contains two statements that are strongly supported by the data: \"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\".\n*   The third statement in Option B (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is incorrect based on a standard definition. However, the other options contain descriptions that are either less accurate (\"same promoter\") or cannot be determined from the experiment (\"pleiotropy\").\n*   Therefore, Option B provides the best overall description of the genetic interactions, despite the inaccuracy of its final clause. It is the most plausible intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
