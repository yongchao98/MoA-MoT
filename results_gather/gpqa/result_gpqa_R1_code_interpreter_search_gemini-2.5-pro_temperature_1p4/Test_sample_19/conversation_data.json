    "This question asks us to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is to simplify a complex many-body problem (an interaction with a nucleus) into a much simpler two-body problem (an interaction with a single, free nucleon).\n\nLet's break down each assumption:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is the foundational assumption. The impulse approximation model replaces the complex interaction with the nucleus as a whole with a sum of interactions with its individual constituents (the nucleons). It assumes the probe, represented by the interaction current, singles out one nucleon to interact with, while the others are \"spectators.\" Without this assumption, we couldn't even begin to treat the problem as an interaction with a single particle. This assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This assumption addresses what happens to the probe particle before the interaction and to the outgoing particles after the interaction. If the nucleus is \"transparent,\" it means the incoming probe doesn't scatter off other nucleons on its way in, and the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon (if any) don't re-interact with the residual nucleus on their way out. These are known as initial-state and final-state interactions (FSI). Ignoring them is a key simplification. Treating the nucleon as truly \"free\" requires its environment to be non-interacting. Therefore, this assumption is also essential for the simplest form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation, or PWIA).\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, describing it as a composite of quarks. However, the impulse approximation is about the behavior of the nucleon as a whole *within the nuclear medium*. It simplifies the interaction between the nucleon and *other nucleons*, not the dynamics *inside* the nucleon. In practice, one often uses experimental form factors for a free nucleon, which encapsulate its true, complex internal structure (including relativistic quark effects) without making any specific assumptions about it. Therefore, this assumption about internal structure is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This gets to the heart of the \"impulse\" concept. The interaction is assumed to happen over a very short timescale, like a sudden strike or impulse. On this short timescale, the much slower-acting nuclear binding forces that hold the nucleon in the nucleus don't have time to act. The nucleon's state (its momentum) is effectively \"frozen\" during the interaction, and for that brief moment, it behaves as a free particle, unbound by the nuclear potential. This assumption is the very definition of treating a bound nucleon as a free one during the collision. It is absolutely essential.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe three assumptions that are required to treat a bound nucleon as a free nucleon during an interaction (the impulse approximation) are:\n- The interaction targets a single nucleon (Assumption 1).\n- The rest of the nucleus is ignored before and after the collision (Assumption 2).\n- The binding forces are negligible during the collision (Assumption 4).\n\nThis corresponds to the combination 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
