    "An optically active compound is a chiral compound, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral carbons), combined with an overall lack of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule has a double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a plane. This planarity acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. The molecule does not have any chiral centers (sp3 carbon with four different substituents). Therefore, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides stereochemical information (`3aR,7aS,E`), indicating that we are considering a specific stereoisomer. The core structure, `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione`, is a saturated norbornane-type skeleton fused with an anhydride ring. This parent skeleton is achiral (meso) due to a plane of symmetry. However, the substituent at position 8 (the methano bridge) is `=CHCl`. This `chloromethylene` group is not symmetric and its presence destroys the plane of symmetry of the parent skeleton. Since the molecule has designated chiral centers (`3aR, 7aS`) and lacks internal symmetry, it is a chiral molecule. As it's specified as a single stereoisomer, it will be optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C3. The configuration is given as `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has two chiral centers with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is often a meso compound. A meso compound is achiral because it possesses an internal element of symmetry (a plane or a center of inversion) that makes it superimposable on its mirror image. For `(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid`, there is a center of inversion halfway along the C2-C3 bond. Thus, it is a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. Both chiral centers have the `R` configuration. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. The `(2R,3R)` molecule is not superimposable on its `(2S,3S)` mirror image. It does not have any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at C1. C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=, and =CH-CH2-CH2-. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies a single enantiomer (`R`). A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name refers to the stereoisomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all cis). This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not chiral centers because the path around the ring in one direction is identical to the path in the other direction.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon atom in the `CH` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. There are no other sp3 carbons with four different groups in the molecule. The molecule is flexible, but it is fundamentally achiral and has conformations with a plane of symmetry. Thus, it is optically inactive.\n\nSummary:\n*   Optically Active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n*   Optically Inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
