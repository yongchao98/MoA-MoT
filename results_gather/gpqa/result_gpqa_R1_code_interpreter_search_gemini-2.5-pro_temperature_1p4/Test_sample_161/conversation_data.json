    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the surface defined by the given metric.\nThe metric is:\n$$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$$\nThis is a 2-dimensional metric on a manifold parametrized by coordinates $(x, y)$. The area element $dA$ is given by the formula $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$, where $g$ is the metric tensor.\n\nThe metric has the form $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + g_{yy}dy^2$, with no cross-terms ($g_{xy}=0$). The components of the metric tensor $g$ are:\n$$g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$$\n$$g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$$\nThe metric tensor can be written as a matrix:\n$$g = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the determinant of the metric tensor:\n$$\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}g_{yx} = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right) - 0 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2$$\n\nNow, we find the square root of the determinant to get the area element's scalar factor:\n$$\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2} = \\left|\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right|$$\n\nThe term \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" and the denominator $4-x^2-y^2$ indicate that the manifold is defined over the domain where the metric is well-defined and positive, which is the open disk $D = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2+y^2 < 4\\}$. In this domain, $4-x^2-y^2 > 0$, so we can drop the absolute value.\nThe area element is:\n$$dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$$\n\nTo find the total area $A$, we must integrate the area element over the domain $D$:\n$$A = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$$\n\nTo evaluate this integral, it is convenient to switch to polar coordinates. Let:\n$x = \\rho \\cos\\theta$\n$y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$\nThen $x^2+y^2 = \\rho^2$, and the area element in the new coordinates is $dx \\, dy = \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$.\nThe domain of integration $D$ in polar coordinates is $0 \\le \\rho < 2$ and $0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$.\n\nSubstituting these into the area integral, we get:\n$$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$$\n\nWe can separate the integrals over $\\theta$ and $\\rho$:\n$$A = \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho \\right) = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho$$\n\nNow we evaluate the integral with respect to $\\rho$. This is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}$ becomes infinite as $\\rho$ approaches 2.\nLet's use the substitution $u = 4 - \\rho^2$. Then $du = -2\\rho \\, d\\rho$, which means $\\rho \\, d\\rho = -\\frac{1}{2} du$.\nThe limits of integration for $u$ are:\n- When $\\rho = 0$, $u = 4 - 0^2 = 4$.\n- When $\\rho \\to 2$, $u \\to 4 - 2^2 = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$$\\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho = \\int_{4}^{0} \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} du\\right) = \\int_{4}^{0} -\\frac{16}{u} \\, du$$\nWe can flip the limits of integration, which changes the sign of the integral:\n$$= \\int_{0}^{4} \\frac{16}{u} \\, du = 16 \\int_{0}^{4} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du$$\n\nThis is a standard divergent integral. Let's evaluate it using a limit:\n$$16 \\int_{0}^{4} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du = 16 \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\int_{\\epsilon}^{4} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du = 16 \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\left[ \\ln|u| \\right]_{\\epsilon}^{4}$$\n$$= 16 \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} (\\ln(4) - \\ln(\\epsilon))$$\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, $\\ln(\\epsilon) \\to -\\infty$. Therefore:\n$$= 16 (\\ln(4) - (-\\infty)) = +\\infty$$\n\nSince the integral over $\\rho$ diverges to $+\\infty$, the total area is:\n$$A = 2\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$$\n\nThe area of the given pseudosphere is infinite.\n\n<<<C>>>"
