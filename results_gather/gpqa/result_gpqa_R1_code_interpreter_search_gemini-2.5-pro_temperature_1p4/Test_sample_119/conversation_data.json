    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Premise:** The problem assumes that stars are uniformly distributed in the three-dimensional space around us. This means the number density of stars, let's call it 'n' (number of stars per unit volume), is a constant value everywhere.\n\n2.  **Relate Number of Stars to Distance:** We want to find the number of stars at a certain distance. Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the Earth.\n    *   Let the radius of this shell be `d` (the distance from Earth).\n    *   Let the thickness of this shell be a very small value, `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin spherical shell (`dV`) can be approximated as its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4 * π * d^2 * dd`.\n    *   Since the star density `n` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the density multiplied by the volume: `dN = n * dV = n * (4 * π * d^2 * dd)`.\n    *   Since `n` and `4π` are constants, we can establish a proportionality: The number of stars `dN` in a small distance interval `dd` at distance `d` is proportional to `d^2 * dd`.\n    *   `dN ∝ d^2 * dd`\n\n3.  **Introduce Parallax:** The question is not about distance (`d`), but about parallax (`plx`). We need to switch our variables from distance to parallax.\n    *   The parallax `plx` is defined as the inverse of the distance `d` (when `d` is measured in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds).\n    *   `plx = 1/d`  or equivalently, `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Relate the Differentials `dd` and `d(plx)`:** We need to relate the small interval of distance `dd` to a corresponding small interval of parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   `d(d) / d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1/plx^2`\n    *   This gives us `dd = (-1/plx^2) * d(plx)`.\n    *   When we are counting stars in a range (or shell), we are concerned with the size of the interval, not its direction (i.e., whether parallax is increasing or decreasing). So, we can take the absolute value or magnitude.\n    *   `|dd| = (1/plx^2) * |d(plx)|`\n\n5.  **Substitute Back into the Proportionality:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` back into our proportionality from step 2 (`dN ∝ d^2 * dd`).\n    *   `dN ∝ (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    *   `dN ∝ (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    *   `dN ∝ (1/plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Final Relationship:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\". This is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`.\n    *   From the last step, we can divide both sides by `d(plx)`:\n    *   `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
