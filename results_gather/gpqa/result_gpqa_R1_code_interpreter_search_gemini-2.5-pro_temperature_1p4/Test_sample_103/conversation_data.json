    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe problem describes the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. This method relies on the Doppler effect. An orbiting planet causes its host star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble induces a periodic change in the star's velocity along our line of sight. This change in velocity causes a periodic shift in the wavelengths of the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe relationship between the radial velocity ($v_r$) and the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is given by the Doppler formula:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe maximum measured velocity is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted by $K$. From the formula, $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n$$ K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max} $$\n\n### 2. Relate the Observed Data to Physical Parameters\n\nWe are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n- Planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ milliangstroms\n- Planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ milliangstroms\n\nFrom the proportionality above, we can find the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7}{5} $$\n\n### 3. Use the Formula for Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude\n\nThe semi-amplitude $K$ is related to the physical parameters of the star-planet system. For a planet of mass $m_p$ in a circular orbit around a star of mass $M_{star}$ with an orbital period $T$, the formula for $K$ is:\n$$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}} $$\nwhere:\n- $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n- $i$ is the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight ($i=90^\\circ$ for an edge-on orbit).\n\n### 4. Set up the Ratio for the Two Systems\n\nWe can write the formula for each system and then take their ratio:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{ \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{M_{star2}^{2/3}} }{ \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{M_{star1}^{2/3}} } $$\n\n### 5. Simplify the Ratio Using the Given Information\n\nThe problem states:\n- The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n- The planets have the same mass: $m_{p1} = m_{p2}$.\n\nThese equalities allow us to cancel out the mass terms ($m_p$ and $M_{star}$). The term $(2\\pi G)$ also cancels out. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{ (1/T_2)^{1/3} \\sin i_2 }{ (1/T_1)^{1/3} \\sin i_1 } = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{\\sin i_2}{\\sin i_1} $$\n\nThe problem does not specify the orbital inclinations ($i_1$, $i_2$). In the absence of this information, it is a standard assumption in such problems that the viewing geometries are similar, meaning $i_1 \\approx i_2$. This implies $\\sin i_1 \\approx \\sin i_2$, and the term $\\frac{\\sin i_2}{\\sin i_1}$ becomes 1.\n\nWith this reasonable simplification, the relationship becomes:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n### 6. Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods\n\nWe want to find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n$$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3 $$\nInverting both sides gives:\n$$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $$\n\n### 7. Calculate the Final Value\n\nNow, we substitute the known ratio of the K values:\n$$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\nSo,\n$$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n\nTo find the decimal value, we perform the division:\n```python\nprint( (5/7)**3 )\n```\n```output\n0.3644321612450849\n```\nThe result is approximately 0.36.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An alternative way to think about the problem is by rearranging the RV semi-amplitude formula to solve for the period T.\n\nFrom:\n$$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}} $$\nLet's isolate T:\n$$ K^3 = \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\left( \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}} \\right)^3 $$\n$$ T = 2\\pi G \\frac{1}{K^3} \\left( \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}} \\right)^3 $$\nThis shows that the orbital period T is inversely proportional to the cube of the RV semi-amplitude K, assuming all other parameters are constant.\n$$ T \\propto \\frac{1}{K^3} $$\n\nGiven the conditions in the problem:\n- $m_{p1} = m_{p2}$\n- $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$\n- We assume $\\sin i_1 = \\sin i_2$\n\nWe can write the ratio of the periods as:\n$$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1/K_2^3}{1/K_1^3} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $$\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the observed wavelength shifts:\n$$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\nSubstituting this into the period ratio equation:\n$$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
