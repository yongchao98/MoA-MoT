    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Concept:** The question revolves around the concept of planetary density. Density (ρ) is defined as mass (M) divided by volume (V), or ρ = M/V. For a spherical planet, V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius. The key factor that influences the density of planets with similar compositions is **gravitational compression**. A more massive planet exerts a stronger gravitational force on its own material, compressing it and increasing its overall density.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is simply our planet, Earth. Its average density serves as a baseline for comparison. The density of Earth is approximately **5.51 g/cm³**.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given directly in the option as **~5.5 g/cm³**. This is about the same as Earth's density. Although it is more massive than Earth, its density is similar, which implies it must be made of lighter materials (e.g., a lower iron-to-silicate ratio) to counteract the effect of gravitational compression.\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet has the same building blocks as Earth (e.g., a similar ratio of iron, nickel, silicates) but is much more massive. Due to its greater mass, it will have much stronger gravity. This intense gravity will compress its material far more than Earth's gravity compresses Earth. As a result, its average density will be **significantly higher** than Earth's density (5.51 g/cm³). For reference, scientific models predict a 5-Earth-mass rocky planet would have a density in the range of 6.5-7.0 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This planet is less massive than Earth. Consequently, its gravitational force is weaker. There will be less gravitational compression on its materials compared to Earth. Therefore, its average density will be **lower** than Earth's density (5.51 g/cm³).\n\n3.  **Compare the Densities:**\n\n    *   Planet (a): ~5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Planet (b): ~5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Planet (c): Significantly > 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Planet (d): < 5.51 g/cm³\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the comparison, the planet described in option (c) will have the highest density because of the increased gravitational compression due to its large mass.\n\n<<<B>>>"
