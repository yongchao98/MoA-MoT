    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. The reaction involves the formation of an enol or enolate, which then attacks the bromine molecule. The bromine atom adds to the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). Since both α-carbons in cyclohexanone are equivalent, only one product is formed.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n    \n     \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents and substrate (an α-halo ketone with an available α'-proton) leads to a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a strained bicyclic intermediate, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-7-one.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, leading to the cleavage of the cyclopropane ring. This bond cleavage occurs to form the more stable carbanion, resulting in a ring contraction.\n    5.  After an acidic workup (which is implicit), the resulting carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard reagent for converting carboxylic acids into acid chlorides. Pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OᵗBu)₃)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n*   **Reaction:** The acid chloride is reduced to an aldehyde.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n     \n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Chemically distinct hydrogens have different chemical environments and will produce separate signals in an NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** On the NMR time scale, due to rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation), the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (C-H and C=O bonds), the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and the opposite ring carbon (if we consider a flat projection, it would bisect the C3-C4 bond). This symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their attached hydrogens equivalent.\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C5, and C3 equivalent to C4.\n*   **Counting the distinct hydrogens:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde H:** The single proton of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **C1-H:** The single proton on the carbon atom where the aldehyde is attached (C1) is also unique. (2 types)\n    3.  **C2/C5 Protons:** The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. One is 'cis' and the other is 'trans' to the aldehyde group, making their environments different. They are not interchangeable by symmetry. However, the symmetry plane makes the 'cis' proton on C2 equivalent to the 'cis' proton on C5, and the 'trans' proton on C2 equivalent to the 'trans' proton on C5. This gives two more sets of distinct hydrogens. (4 types total)\n    4.  **C3/C4 Protons:** Similarly, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the two protons on C3 equivalent to their counterparts on C4. This gives another two sets of distinct hydrogens. (6 types total)\n\nLet's summarize the distinct sets of hydrogens:\n1.  The aldehyde proton (1H)\n2.  The C1 proton (1H)\n3.  The two 'cis'-like protons on C2 and C5 (2H total)\n4.  The two 'trans'-like protons on C2 and C5 (2H total)\n5.  The two 'cis'-like protons on C3 and C4 (2H total)\n6.  The two 'trans'-like protons on C3 and C4 (2H total)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
