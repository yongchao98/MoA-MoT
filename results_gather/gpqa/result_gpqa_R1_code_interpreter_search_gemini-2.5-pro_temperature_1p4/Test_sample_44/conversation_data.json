    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Governing Principles:**\n    *   The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n    *   Fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n    *   The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n\n2.  **Define the Quantum States:**\n    *   For a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized and given by the formula:\n        E_n = n^2 * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n        where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    *   The problem defines E = π²ħ² / 2mL², so the energy levels can be expressed simply as E_n = n²E.\n    *   A complete quantum state for a particle is defined by both its energy level (n) and its spin state (m_s). Since the particles are spin-1/2, the spin quantum number m_s can be either +1/2 (spin up) or -1/2 (spin down).\n    *   Therefore, due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_g):**\n    *   To find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n    *   **Level n=1:** We place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down). Their total energy is 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1²E) = 2E.\n    *   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles in the next lowest level (one spin up, one spin down). Their total energy is 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2²E) = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy:** Sum the energies of all four particles.\n        E_g = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1*):**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n    *   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   The new configuration is:\n        *   Two particles in level n=1 (Energy = 2 * E₁ = 2E)\n        *   One particle in level n=2 (Energy = 1 * E₂ = 1 * (2²E) = 4E)\n        *   One particle in level n=3 (Energy = 1 * E₃ = 1 * (3²E) = 9E)\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy:** Sum the energies for this new configuration.\n        E_1* = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2*):**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider all possible low-energy promotions from the ground state.\n    *   We already found the first excitation: promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3, which resulted in E = 15E.\n    *   Let's consider other promotions from the ground state (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2):\n        *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n            *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n            *   Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * 1²E) + (2 * 2²E) + (1 * 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n        *   **Possibility B:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n            *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=4.\n            *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = (2 * 1²E) + (1 * 2²E) + (1 * 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n        *   **Possibility C:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n            *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n            *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1²E) + (2 * 3²E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is the first excited state (15E), and the next lowest is **18E**. This is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n6.  **Final Result:**\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
