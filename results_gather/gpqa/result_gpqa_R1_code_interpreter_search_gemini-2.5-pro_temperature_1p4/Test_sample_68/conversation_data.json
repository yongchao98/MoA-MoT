    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum distance a particle $X^0$ must travel before decaying so that at least 30% of the decays are observable. This minimum distance corresponds to the resolution of the detector.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand the scenario in the Lab Frame:**\n    The particle $X^0$ is created in the CERN Bubble Chamber and moves at a relativistic speed. Its lifetime, as observed in the lab frame, is dilated due to its high velocity. The distance it travels before decaying depends on this lab-frame lifetime and its velocity.\n\n2.  **Relate Observation Probability to Decay Distance:**\n    The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The fraction of particles that have not decayed after a time $t$ in the lab frame is given by $N(t)/N_0 = e^{-t/\\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is the mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n    A decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than or equal to the detector's resolution, let's call it $L$. The time it takes to travel this distance is $t = L/v$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n    Therefore, the fraction of observed decays is the fraction of particles that survive for at least the time $t = L/v$. This is given by the probability $P(\\text{survival}) = e^{-t/\\tau} = e^{-(L/v)/\\tau} = e^{-L/(v\\tau)}$.\n    The term $v\\tau$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame, denoted by $\\lambda_{lab}$. So, the fraction of observed decays is $e^{-L/\\lambda_{lab}}$.\n    The problem states that we need to observe *at least 30%* of the decays. This gives us the condition:\n    $e^{-L/\\lambda_{lab}} \\ge 0.30$\n    To find the minimum required resolution, we consider the boundary case:\n    $e^{-L/\\lambda_{lab}} = 0.30$\n    Solving for $L$:\n    $-L/\\lambda_{lab} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $L = -\\lambda_{lab} \\ln(0.30)$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length in the Lab Frame ($\\lambda_{lab}$):**\n    The mean decay length is given by $\\lambda_{lab} = v \\tau$.\n    The lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$: $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    So, $\\lambda_{lab} = v \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    We can write the velocity as $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = v/c$ and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    $\\lambda_{lab} = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$.\n    The term $\\gamma \\beta$ can be calculated from the particle's energy ($E$) and rest mass ($m$).\n    The relativistic energy is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, and the momentum is $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m \\beta c$.\n    In units where $c=1$, we have $E = \\gamma m$ and $p = \\gamma \\beta m$.\n    From the energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, we can find $pc$.\n    $p = \\sqrt{E^2 - m^2}$.\n    Then, $\\gamma \\beta = p/m = \\sqrt{E^2 - m^2}/m$.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    The given values are:\n    *   Energy of $X^0$, $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Mass of $X^0$, $m = 3.41$ GeV (this is shorthand for $m c^2 = 3.41$ GeV)\n    *   Proper lifetime of $X^0$, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n    First, calculate the momentum in units of GeV/c:\n    $p = \\sqrt{E^2 - m^2} = \\sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV/c.\n\n    Next, calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda_{lab}$:\n    $\\lambda_{lab} = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0 = \\frac{p}{m} c \\tau_0$\n    $\\lambda_{lab} = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV/c}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV/c}^2}\\right) c \\tau_0 = \\left(\\frac{26.78}{3.41}\\right) c \\tau_0$\n    $\\lambda_{lab} \\approx (7.8545) \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda_{lab} \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n    Finally, calculate the required resolution $L$:\n    $L = -\\lambda_{lab} \\ln(0.30)$\n    Using $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n    $L \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n    $L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n    This calculated value is closest to option D.

    "The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle $X^0$. This means we need to find the minimum distance $L$ that the particle must travel for its decay to be considered \"observed\". If a particle travels a distance greater than or equal to $L$ before decaying, we count it as observed. The fraction of particles that are observed must be at least 30%.\n\n1.  **Exponential Decay Law**: The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential probability distribution. The fraction of particles that survive after a time $t$ in the laboratory frame is given by:\n    $N(t)/N_0 = e^{-t/\\tau}$\n    where $N_0$ is the initial number of particles and $\\tau$ is the mean lifetime of the particle in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Condition for Observation**: A decay is observed if the particle travels a distance $d \\ge L$. The time it takes to travel a distance $L$ is $t = L/v$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.

In relativistic mechanics (using units where $c=1$):\n    $E = \\gamma m$\n    $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma \\beta m$\n    From this, we get $\\gamma \\beta = p/m$. The momentum $p$ can be found from the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = p^2c^2 + (mc^2)^2$.

The provided code output, `2.268011062288596e-06`, is the result of a correct physical and mathematical derivation based on the problem statement. The slight discrepancy between this calculated answer and the closest multiple-choice option (D) often occurs in physics problems due to the rounding of input values. Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\" needed to \"observe at least 30% of the decays.\" In the context of a particle detector like a bubble chamber, observing a decay means being able to resolve the track of the decaying particle before it decays. This implies that the particle must travel a distance `L` (the resolution) before it decays. Therefore, we are looking for the minimum distance `L` such that the probability of the particle traveling at least this distance is 30%.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Decay:** The decay of unstable particles is governed by an exponential law. The fraction of particles that survive (i.e., do not decay) for a time `t` in the laboratory frame is given by:\n    $P(\\text{survival time} \\ge t) = e^{-t/\\tau}$\n    where $\\tau$ is the particle's mean lifetime as measured in the lab frame.\n\n3.  **Connecting Time, Distance, and Probability:**\n    *   The particle $X^0$ travels at a relativistic velocity, `v`.\n    *   The time it takes to travel the resolution distance `L` is $t = L/v$.\n    *   The probability of observing the decay (i.e., the particle traveling a distance $d \\ge L$) is the probability of it surviving for a time $t \\ge L/v$.\n    *   So, we set the probability: $P(d \\ge L) = e^{-(L/v)/\\tau} = e^{-L/(v\\tau)} = 0.30$.\n    *   The term $v\\tau$ is the mean distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying, known as the mean decay length, $\\lambda_{lab}$.\n    *   The equation becomes: $e^{-L/\\lambda_{lab}} = 0.30$.\n\n4.  **Solving for the Resolution L:**\n    To find `L`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-L/\\lambda_{lab} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $L = -\\lambda_{lab} \\ln(0.30)$\n\n5.  **Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda_{lab}$):**\n    *   The lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$, is time-dilated from the proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ (the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n        $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    *   So, $\\lambda_{lab} = v\\tau = v(\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   We can find the factor $\\gamma\\beta$ from the particle's energy and mass. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The relativistic momentum is $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m \\beta c$.\n    *   From these, we can derive $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$.\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   Given values:\n        *   Total Energy $E = 27$ GeV\n        *   Rest Mass $m$ (meaning $mc^2$) $= 3.41$ GeV\n        *   Proper Lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        *   Speed of light $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   We use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE = 27  # GeV\nm = 3.41 # GeV (this represents mc^2)\ntau0 = 8e-16 # s\nc = 299792458 # m/s\nprobability_observed = 0.30\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the momentum-energy factor (gamma*beta)\n# gamma*beta = pc / (mc^2) = sqrt(E^2 - (mc^2)^2) / (mc^2)\ngamma_beta = np.sqrt(E**2 - m**2) / m\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame\n# lambda_lab = gamma * beta * c * tau0\nlambda_lab = gamma_beta * c * tau0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the minimum resolution L\n# L = -lambda_lab * ln(probability_observed)\nL = -lambda_lab * np.log(probability_observed)\n\nprint(L)\n```\n```output\n2.268011062288596e-06\n```\nThe calculation yields a required resolution of $L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters.\n\n### Final Answer Selection\n\nThe calculated value is $L = 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.
