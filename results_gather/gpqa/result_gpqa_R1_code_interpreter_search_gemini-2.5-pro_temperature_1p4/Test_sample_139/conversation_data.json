    "Here is my thinking process to solve this complex chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the user's request into individual, manageable clues.\n    *   **Clue 1:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements.\n    *   **Clue 2:** Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y.\n    *   **Clue 3:** A gas W is released. The number of protons in a molecule of W equals the number of neutrons.\n    *   **Clue 4:** A precipitate G is formed. When heated, G releases a substance B.\n    *   **Clue 5:** Substance B has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n    *   **Clue 6:** When X reacts with a keto acid, the product has 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Clue 7:** X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry.\n    *   **The Goal:** Identify X and calculate the sum of the atomic masses of all atoms of its lightest and heaviest constituent elements.\n\n2.  **Solve the Easiest Clue First (Clue 5):**\n    *   The melting point of B is ~277 K.\n    *   277 K = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O, where D is deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen) is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This is an almost perfect match. Therefore, **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n3.  **Work Backwards from B=D₂O:**\n    *   **Clue 4:** Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This means G must be a deuterated hydrate (a compound that has D₂O in its crystal structure) or a metal deuteroxide (which decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O). For example, a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)x` would decompose upon heating: `2M(OD)x -> M₂Ox + x D₂O`. This seems plausible.\n    *   **Connecting to other clues:** If G is a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)x`, it contains deuterium (D) and oxygen (O). The D must come from Substance X (Clue 1) or liquid Y. The O must also come from X or Y.\n    *   If the product G contains the OD⁻ group, and we know D is a key isotope here, it's highly likely that liquid Y provides both the O and the D for this group. This makes **liquid Y heavy water (D₂O)** itself. This would be a violent reaction (Clue 2) if X is a powerful reducing agent.\n\n4.  **Re-evaluate the Reaction with Y = D₂O:**\n    *   The reaction is now: **Substance X (contains D) + D₂O (liquid Y) → Gas W (protons=neutrons) + Precipitate G (a deuteroxide)**.\n\n5.  **Identify Gas W (Clue 3):**\n    *   We need a gas molecule where the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons. Let's test candidates:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen gas): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. No.\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** 2 protons (1 from each D), 2 neutrons (1 from each D). **Yes, this works!**\n        *   ND₃ (Deutero-ammonia): N(7p,7n) + 3*D(1p,1n) = 10 protons, 10 neutrons. This is a possibility.\n    *   If W is D₂, it must be formed from the deuterium in both Substance X and liquid Y (D₂O). This requires a specific type of reducing agent.\n\n6.  **Identify Substance X (Clues 1, 6, 7):**\n    *   Clue 7 states X and its analog are organic chemistry reagents. This points towards common reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   Clue 1 states X contains a heavier isotope. The deuterated versions, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)** and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄), are perfect candidates. The \"very close analog\" of LiAlD₄ is LiAlH₄.\n    *   Let's test X = LiAlD₄.\n        *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n        *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂. As we found in step 5, this fits the proton/neutron rule. (Check!)\n        *   **Precipitate G:** The products are Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble, and Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Aluminum hydroxide is a well-known gelatinous precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would be as well. This fits the clue. (Check!)\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating Al(OD)₃ gives Aluminum oxide and D₂O (substance B). `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. (Check!)\n        *   **Reaction with keto acid (Clue 6):** A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-COOH. It contains one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group, for a total of 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both groups to alcohols (a diol). The final product, R-CH(OD)-CD₂(OD), would contain only 2 oxygen atoms. This matches the clue perfectly. (Check!)\n\n7.  **Final Confirmation:** All clues point conclusively to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n8.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Question:** Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄), summing the masses for all instances of those elements.\n    *   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest:** We compare them by atomic number (Z).\n        *   Hydrogen (D): Z = 1 (Lightest)\n        *   Lithium: Z = 3\n        *   Aluminum: Z = 13 (Heaviest)\n    *   **Find masses of all atoms of the lightest element:** The lightest element is Hydrogen, present as 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). We use integer mass numbers for simplicity, as is standard in this type of problem. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from lightest element = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Find masses of all atoms of the heaviest element:** The heaviest element is Aluminum, present as 1 atom. The mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminum is 27.\n        *   Total mass from heaviest element = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Calculate the cumulative sum:**\n        *   Sum = (Total mass from lightest) + (Total mass from heaviest)\n        *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
