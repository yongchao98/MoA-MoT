    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopologue of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n    *   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%).\n    *   This M+/M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32 ≈ 3:1) is the characteristic isotopic signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n    *   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n    *   **Signal at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n        *   The chemical shift (11.0 ppm) is very far downfield, which is typical for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The multiplicity is a singlet (s), meaning it has no adjacent protons, which is expected for a -COOH proton.\n        *   The integration (1H) shows it corresponds to one proton. This confirms the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Signals at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n        *   These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n        *   The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side equivalent to each other. They split each other into doublets.\n        *   The downfield chemical shifts indicate that both substituents on the ring are electron-withdrawing. A carboxylic acid and a chlorine atom are both electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   **Conclusion from NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n4.  **Synthesize All Data and Evaluate Options:**\n    *   From MS, we know the molecule is CₓHᵧ³⁵ClO₂ with a mass of 156.\n    *   From IR and NMR, we know it's a chlorobenzoic acid.\n    *   From NMR, we know the substitution pattern is para (1,4).\n    *   This leads directly to the structure of **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check the molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂):\n*   Mass = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\nThis matches the M+ peak perfectly.\n\nLet's briefly consider why the other options are incorrect:\n*   A) Phenyl chloroformate: Lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group (inconsistent with IR and NMR).\n*   B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Ortho-substitution would give a complex multiplet in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n*   C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. The IR and NMR data would be completely different (e.g., aldehyde proton ~10 ppm, phenolic -OH, etc.).\n\nTherefore, all the evidence points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
