    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the given information**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds in the mixture.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **2. Evaluate the candidate compounds**\n\nFirst, let's confirm the molecular formula of the options.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzene isomers (C6H2(CH3)4):** 6 carbons from the ring + 4 carbons from methyl groups = 10 carbons. 2 hydrogens from the ring + (4 * 3) hydrogens from methyl groups = 14 hydrogens. Formula is C10H14. This applies to 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(CH2CH3)2):** 6 carbons from the ring + (2 * 2) carbons from ethyl groups = 10 carbons. 4 hydrogens from the ring + (2 * 5) hydrogens from ethyl groups = 14 hydrogens. Formula is C10H14.\n\nAll four compounds have the correct molecular formula.\n\nNow, let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound based on its symmetry. The number of signals corresponds to the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The four protons on the benzene ring are chemically equivalent. They would produce **one singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The -CH2- protons would be split by the adjacent -CH3 protons, resulting in a **quartet**. The -CH3 protons would be split by the -CH2- protons, resulting in a **triplet**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound would show a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region. The problem states that all signals in this region are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be in the mixture**. This eliminates option C.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl protons:** The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 12H).\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   Set 1: Me at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** (6H).\n        *   Set 2: Me at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** (6H).\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H; ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups:\n        *   Set 1: Me at C1 and C3 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** (6H).\n        *   Set 2: Me at C2 is unique. This gives **one singlet** (3H).\n        *   Set 3: Me at C5 is unique. This gives **one singlet** (3H).\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H; ratio 2:1:1).\n\n### **3. Analyze the mixture based on the options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that gives:\n*   Two 1:1 aromatic singlets.\n*   Three 2:1:1 aliphatic singlets.\n\nAll three remaining tetramethylbenzene isomers give one aromatic singlet for 2H. Therefore, any 1:1 mixture of two of them will produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. The deciding factor is the pattern in the aliphatic region.\n\nLet's test the remaining options:\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   Durene contributes: 1 aliphatic singlet (12H)\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: 2 aliphatic singlets (6H and 6H)\n    *   Combined spectrum: We expect three distinct aliphatic singlets with relative integrations of 12H : 6H : 6H.\n    *   The ratio simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This combination perfectly matches the experimental data.**\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   Durene contributes: 1 aliphatic singlet (12H)\n    *   Isodurene contributes: 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n    *   Combined spectrum: We would expect a total of four aliphatic singlets (unless some accidentally overlap). This contradicts the data, which shows three signals.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H)\n    *   Isodurene contributes: 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n    *   Combined spectrum: We would expect up to five signals. Even with a perfect overlap of the 6H signals, we would get three signals with an integration ratio of (6H+6H) : 3H : 3H = 12:3:3, which simplifies to 4:1:1. This does not match the 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair that matches the NMR data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Their 1:1 mixture gives two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (from signals integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H).\n\n<<<A>>>"
