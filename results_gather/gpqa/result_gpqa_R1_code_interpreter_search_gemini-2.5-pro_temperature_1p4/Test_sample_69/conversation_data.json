    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical riddle and determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Clues\n\nLet's break down the four clues provided in the riddle:\n\n1.  **Solid A + 8 equivalents of Gas B → Bright red Product C**: This describes the formation of a coordination compound or a product of a specific reaction with a striking color and a very specific 1:8 stoichiometry.\n2.  **C + 2 equivalents of Gas D → Extremely hazardous Product E**: Product C reacts further to form a very dangerous substance E. The identity of E is central to the question.\n3.  **C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)**: This is a hydrolysis reaction. It's a very strong clue because C breaks down to regenerate the starting material A and produces two different acids, one strong and one weak. The regeneration of A is a key constraint.\n4.  **D + B (1:1 ratio) → H (solvent)**: This links the reactants B and D, showing they react in a simple ratio to form a substance used as a solvent.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Hypothesis based on Clue 4\n\nClue 4 provides a simple reaction between two gases, B and D, to form a solvent, H. A very well-known reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas:\n\n`CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l/g)`\n\nPhosgene (COCl₂) is a liquid below 8°C and is used as a specialty solvent and a reagent. This reaction is a 1:1 ratio. This gives us a strong hypothesis for the identities of B, D, and H.\n\n*   Hypothesis: {B, D} = {CO, Cl₂} and H = COCl₂.\n\n### Step 3: Test the Hypothesis with the Remaining Clues\n\nWe have two possibilities for which gas is B and which is D. Let's test them.\n\n**Case 1: B = Cl₂ and D = CO**\n\n*   **Clue 1**: `A(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → C(red)`\n*   **Clue 3**: `C + H₂O → A + F(strong) + G(weak)`\n    This presents a problem. If C is a chloride of element A (formed by reacting A with Cl₂), its hydrolysis would be something like `MClₓ + nH₂O → M(OH)ₓ + xHCl`. This produces only one acid (HCl). It would not regenerate the solid A (the metal/element) and it wouldn't produce a second, weak acid. Therefore, this case is unlikely to be correct.\n\n**Case 2: B = CO and D = Cl₂**\n\n*   Let's check the clues with this assignment:\n    *   **B = CO** (Carbon monoxide gas)\n    *   **D = Cl₂** (Chlorine gas)\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (Phosgene)\n\n*   **Clue 1**: `A(s) + 8 CO(g) → C(red)`\n    This describes the formation of a metal carbonyl. Let's look for a reaction that fits the stoichiometry and color. The reaction of cobalt metal with carbon monoxide is:\n    `2 Co(s) + 8 CO(g) → Co₂(CO)₈(s)`\n    This reaction fits the clue perfectly:\n    *   **A = Co** (Cobalt, a solid)\n    *   The stoichiometry is 2 moles of solid A to 8 moles of gas B. This fits the \"8 equivalents\" part.\n    *   **C = Co₂(CO)₈** (Dicobalt octacarbonyl). This compound consists of orange-red crystals, which fits the \"bright red product\" description.\n\n*   **Clue 2**: `C + 2 D → E(hazardous)`\n    Substituting our compounds: `Co₂(CO)₈ + 2 Cl₂ → E`\n    The known reaction is:\n    `Co₂(CO)₈ + Cl₂ → 2 CoCl(CO)₄`\n    This intermediate, upon heating or with more chlorine, decomposes. However, another known reaction is the direct chlorination to cobalt(II) chloride:\n    `Co₂(CO)₈ + 2 Cl₂ → 2 CoCl₂ + 8 CO`\n    This reaction produces two products, cobalt(II) chloride and carbon monoxide gas. Carbon monoxide is an extremely hazardous gas due to its high toxicity (it's a chemical asphyxiant). It is reasonable within the context of a riddle to identify the hazardous product **E** as the **carbon monoxide (CO)** produced in this reaction.\n\n*   **Clue 3**: `C + H₂O → A + F + G`\n    This clue is the most difficult one and often a point of confusion in this riddle. The hydrolysis of dicobalt octacarbonyl (`Co₂(CO)₈`) is complex and does not cleanly reform Cobalt metal (A) plus a strong and weak acid under simple conditions. It's likely that this clue is either a \"red herring\" or refers to a very specific, non-standard reaction condition not readily found. Given how well all other clues fit this set of compounds, it's probable we should proceed despite the ambiguity of this one clue. The other parts of the puzzle strongly support this solution path.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E\n\nBased on our deduction from Step 3, the extremely hazardous product E is carbon monoxide (CO). Now we need to determine its molecular symmetry group.\n\n*   **E = CO** (Carbon Monoxide)\n*   Carbon monoxide is a linear, diatomic molecule. It does not have a center of inversion (an inversion center, i, would map C to O and O to C, which is not an identity operation as the atoms are different).\n*   Linear molecules without a center of inversion belong to the **C∞v** point group.\n\nHowever, C∞v is not among the options. Let's re-read the question and options carefully. It seems there might be a misunderstanding or a trick in the question or options. Let's reconsider the products of `Co₂(CO)₈ + 2 Cl₂ → 2 CoCl₂ + 8 CO`. E might be CoCl₂, but it's not \"extremely hazardous\".\n\nThere is a known flaw in the popular \"cobalt\" solution to this riddle concerning the hydrolysis step. Let's reconsider the very first hypothesis for B, D, and H, and assume it's E being formed in step 4.\n\nAlternative interpretation:\nLet's reconsider Step 2: D+B -> H. What if H and E are the same substance?\nLet's assume **E is Phosgene, COCl₂**.\n*   This makes sense, as phosgene is extremely hazardous.\n*   This fits with `{B, D} = {CO, Cl₂}`. Let's say **B=Cl₂** and **D=CO**.\n*   Then reaction `D + B -> H` is `CO + Cl₂ -> COCl₂`, so **H=COCl₂**.\n*   And `C + 2D -> E` is `C + 2CO -> COCl₂`. This doesn't make chemical sense.\n\nThis reveals that these classic riddles can have inconsistencies. However, we must choose from the given options. Let's evaluate the molecular symmetry of the most plausible hazardous products we have encountered:\n\n1.  **Phosgene (COCl₂)**: This molecule has a C=O double bond and two C-Cl single bonds. It is planar. It has a C₂ axis along the C=O bond and two vertical mirror planes (one in the molecular plane, one bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle). This belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n2.  **Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**: This molecule is square planar. It belongs to the **D4h** point group.\n3.  **Cyanogen ((CN)₂)**: This molecule is linear (N≡C-C≡N). It has a center of inversion. It belongs to the **D∞h** point group.\n\nOf these possibilities, the chain of deductions involving phosgene as a product is often associated with riddles of this type, even if some steps are flawed. The reaction `CO + Cl₂ -> COCl₂` is a very common and fitting answer to clue 4. It's plausible that E is intended to be phosgene.\n\nLet's assume E is Phosgene (COCl₂). Its molecular symmetry group is **C2v**.\n\n*   The molecule has a principal C₂ axis.\n*   It has two vertical mirror planes (σv).\n*   The combination of these elements defines the **C2v** point group.\n\nGiven the choices, and the common chemical knowledge that phosgene is a C2v molecule and famously hazardous, this is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
