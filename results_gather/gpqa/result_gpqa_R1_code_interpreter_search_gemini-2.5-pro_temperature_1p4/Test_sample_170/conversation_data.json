    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring with an existing substituent. The substituent on the ring determines two things:\n*   **Reactivity**: Whether the ring is more or less reactive than benzene itself (activation/deactivation).\n*   **Directing Effect**: Where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will add (ortho/para positions or meta position).\n\nThe question asks for the order of increasing yield of the **para-isomer**.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Substance**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituent for each of the six compounds:\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**: -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is weakly **activating** and an **ortho, para-director**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)**: -COOC2H5 is an ester group. It is **deactivating** and a **meta-director**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**: -Cl is a halogen. It is **deactivating** but an **ortho, para-director** (a special case).\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**: -NO2 is a nitro group. It is strongly **deactivating** and a **meta-director**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**: -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is weakly **activating** and an **ortho, para-director**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)**: -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It is **deactivating** and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Group the Substances**\n\nWe can split the substances into two groups:\n*   **Meta-directors**: These will produce a very small percentage of the para-isomer. The major product will be meta.\n    *   4) C6H5-NO2\n    *   6) C6H5-COOH\n    *   2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors**: These will produce a large percentage of ortho and para isomers.\n    *   1) C6H5-CH3\n    *   5) C6H5-C2H5\n    *   3) C6H5-Cl\n\nThe substances in the meta-directing group will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will come first in our ordered list.\n\n**4. Order the Meta-Directors**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is very low. The stronger the deactivating effect of the group, the less it will allow substitution at any position, but especially at the ortho and para positions. Therefore, the strongest deactivating group will produce the least amount of para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro > Carboxylic Acid > Ester)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of their deactivating strength:\nC6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)\n\nThe beginning of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**5. Order the Ortho, Para-Directors**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, the key factor that determines the ratio of para to ortho product is **steric hindrance**. A larger substituent group will block the adjacent ortho positions, making it harder for the incoming bromine to attack there. This favors substitution at the sterically unhindered para position.\n\nLet's compare the substituents: -CH3 (1), -C2H5 (5), and -Cl (3).\n\n*   **-CH3 vs -C2H5**: The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene because its ortho positions are more hindered.\n    *   Yield: C6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5)\n\n*   **-Cl vs Alkyl Groups**: The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivating ortho, para-director. Its strong negative inductive effect deactivates the ortho positions more than the para position. Combined with resonance effects that direct to both, this results in a very high preference for the para position. Experimental data shows chlorobenzene gives an exceptionally high yield of the para-isomer (around 87%) compared to alkylbenzenes like toluene (~67%).\n    *   Yield: C6H5-C2H5 (5) < C6H5-Cl (3)\n\nCombining these, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\nC6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5) < C6H5-Cl (3)\n\nThe end of our sequence is **... 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Combine the Orders**\n\nNow we combine the two ordered groups:\n(Meta-directors) < (Ortho, Para-directors)\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence:\nNitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene\n\n**7. Match with Options**\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nOur derived order, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
