    "This problem requires us to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f` over a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\nThe integral is given by: `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field**\n\nThe problem states that the vector field `f(r)`:\n*   Falls off radially as `1/r^2`. This means its magnitude is `|f| = 1/r^2`.\n*   Has a non-zero component only along the radial direction.\n\nIn spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume `V`.\nMathematically:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`, and `S` is its surface.\n\n**A note on the singularity:** The vector field `f = r_hat / r^2` is undefined at the origin `r = 0`. The Divergence Theorem requires the field to be well-behaved within the volume. However, we can still use the theorem by understanding that it equates the total divergence within the volume (the sum of all sources and sinks) to the total flux leaving the boundary surface. The singularity at the origin acts as a source, and its strength can be found by calculating the flux through the enclosing surface.\n\n**3. Calculate the Surface Integral (Flux)**\n\nWe need to compute the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **The vector field on the surface S:** The surface is the sphere of radius `r = R`. On this surface, the field is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n*   **The differential surface element dS:** For a sphere, the differential area element vector `dS` always points radially outward. Its magnitude is `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. So the vector is:\n    `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`\n    where `θ` is the polar angle (from 0 to π) and `φ` is the azimuthal angle (from 0 to 2π).\n\n*   **The dot product f ⋅ dS:**\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the terms `1/R^2` and `R^2` cancel out:\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   **Integrate over the surface S:**\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    Let's solve the integral in two steps:\n    1.  Integrate with respect to `θ`:\n        `∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)](from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    2.  Integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n        `∫(from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = 2 * [φ](from 0 to 2π) = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe value of the surface integral is `4π`. By the Divergence Theorem, this is equal to the volume integral of the divergence of the field.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere, as long as it encloses the origin. The value `4π` represents the total source strength of the field at the origin.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 4 π\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
