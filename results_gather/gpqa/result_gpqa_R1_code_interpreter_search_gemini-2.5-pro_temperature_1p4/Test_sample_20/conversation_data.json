    "*   **Step 1: Analyze Tautomerism for Compound (A)**\n    *   Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group). These isomers are in dynamic equilibrium.\n    *   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** This molecule is a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (C=O) are part of the ring's C=C double bonds. These carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Therefore, benzoquinone has no α-hydrogens and cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule is a saturated six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are -CH2- groups. Each of these carbons has two hydrogen atoms which are α-hydrogens (in fact, they are alpha to two carbonyl groups, making them particularly acidic). The presence of these α-hydrogens allows the compound to tautomerize. It readily converts to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is aromatic and therefore very stable. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exhibits tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Optical Isomerism for Compound (B)**\n    *   Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C-2), which is bonded to the -OH group. The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with a *trans* configuration around the carbon-carbon double bond. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there is no chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the results**\n    *   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
