    "This problem requires calculating the mole fraction (percentage) of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution containing various cobalt-thiocyanate complexes.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:** The solution contains free Co(II) ions (`Co^2+`) and thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`). They react to form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]^+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]^-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`.\n\n2.  **Define the total concentration of cobalt:** The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all the complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n3.  **Use stability constants (β) to relate complex concentrations:** The overall stability constants (βn) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN-]`).\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n4.  **Substitute these into the total concentration equation:**\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + (β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]) + (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) + (β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3) + (β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4)`\n    By factoring out `[Co^2+]`, we get:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Define the mole fraction (α) of the target complex:** The percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which we'll call `α2`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100.\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n6.  **Derive the formula for the mole fraction:** Substitute the expressions from steps 3 and 4 into the equation for `α2`:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]` and the stability constants:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n7.  **Plug in the given values and calculate:**\n    *   `[SCN-]` = 0.1 M\n    *   `β1` = 9\n    *   `β2` = 40 (This is the target complex)\n    *   `β3` = 63\n    *   `β4` = 16\n\n    We can calculate each term in the formula. Let's use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The numerator is the term corresponding to the desired complex, [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc ** 2)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of terms for all possible cobalt species (including the free ion)\n# Let's call the sum of all terms 'P' (the polynomial in [SCN-])\n# P = 1 (for Co^2+) + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# The mole fraction (alpha2) is the ratio of the specific term to the sum of all terms\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\n# Print the final result, rounded for clarity\nprint(f\"{percentage:.1f}\")\n```\n>>>\n16.9\n<<<\n\nThe calculation shows that the fraction `α2` is approximately 0.169, which corresponds to 16.9%. This matches option D. The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10^-2 M` is not required for this calculation, as the `[Co^2+]` term cancels out. We assume that \"[SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\" refers to the free equilibrium concentration of the ligand.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### **1. Understand the System**\n\nIn the solution, free cobalt ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`) to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all its complexes:\n\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)_2]] + [[Co(SCN)_3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)_4]^2-]`\n\n### **2. Use Stability Constants (β)**\n\nThe overall stability constants (`β_n`) relate the concentration of each complex to the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and free ligand (`[SCN-]`) concentrations:\n\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β_1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)_2]] = β_2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)_3]^-] = β_3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)_4]^2-] = β_4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n### **3. Calculate the Mole Fraction (α)**\n\nThe percentage of a specific species is determined by its mole fraction (`α`). We are interested in the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)_2]`, which corresponds to `α_2`.\n\nThe mole fraction `α_2` is given by:\n\n`α_2 = [[Co(SCN)_2]] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from step 2 into the equation for `c(Co)` and then into the equation for `α_2`, we can derive a general formula for the mole fraction:\n\n`α_2 = (β_2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β_1[SCN-] + β_2[SCN-]^2 + β_3[SCN-]^3 + β_4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nNotice that the free cobalt concentration `[Co^2+]` cancels out, meaning the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for this calculation.\n\n### **4. Substitute the Given Values**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β_1 = 9`\n*   `β_2 = 40`\n*   `β_3 = 63`\n*   `β_4 = 16`\n\nLet's calculate the numerator and the denominator of the `α_2` formula.\n\n**Numerator:**\n`β_2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n**Denominator:**\n*   Term 0 (for `Co^2+`): `1`\n*   Term 1 (for `[Co(SCN)]^+`): `β_1 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n*   Term 2 (for `[Co(SCN)_2]`): `β_2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n*   Term 3 (for `[Co(SCN)_3]^-`): `β_3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n*   Term 4 (for `[Co(SCN)_4]^2-`): `β_4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n\nSum of denominator terms = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n### **5. Final Calculation**\n\nNow, we can find the mole fraction `α_2`:\n\n`α_2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\n\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis result matches the output from the provided Python code.\n\n<<<D>>>"
