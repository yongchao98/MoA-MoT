    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Identify the components and their nature:**\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid):** A weak acid.\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid):** A strong acid.\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide):** A strong base.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial moles of acids and bases:**\nThe number of moles is calculated using the formula: Moles = Concentration (M) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = 0.1 M × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl:**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.2 M × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that dissociates to yield two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 M × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n**3. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\nThe neutralization process occurs in steps. The strongest acid will react with the strongest base first.\n\n*   **Step 3a: Reaction between the strong acid (HCl) and the strong base (Ba(OH)₂):**\n    *   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H⁺ ions are the limiting reactant. They will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Step 3b: Reaction between the remaining strong base (OH⁻) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    *   Reaction: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n    *   The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**4. Determine the composition of the final solution:**\nAfter all reactions, the final solution contains:\n*   Excess strong base (OH⁻): 0.050 mol\n*   Acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), a weak base: 0.050 mol (produced from the reaction in Step 3b)\n*   Water and spectator ions (Cl⁻, Ba²⁺).\n\nThe pH of the solution will be primarily determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻), as it is much stronger than the weak base (CH₃COO⁻).\n\n**5. Calculate the final pH:**\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻ ions:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
