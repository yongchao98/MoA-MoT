    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe system starts as a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\nThe notation `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial state `NN(i)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` implies the orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` implies the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe problem specifies three key principles to use:\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** For the final two-nucleon state `NN(f)`, the given rule is `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to the standard requirement that the total wavefunction be antisymmetric, which implies `L+S+T` must be an odd number.\n\n### 3. Apply the Constraints to the General Transition\n\nThe transition is `NN(i) -> NN(f) + X`.\n\n*   **Constraint 1: Angular Momentum Conservation**\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final nucleon system's angular momentum `J(NN_f)` and the angular momentum of particle X. The problem uses lowercase letters (`s, p, d, f`) for X, which denotes its orbital angular momentum `l_X` relative to the `NN(f)` system. We assume the spin of X is zero or doesn't participate.\n    *   So, `J_i = J(NN_f) + l_X` (vector sum).\n    *   `0 = J(NN_f) + l_X`. This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J(NN_f) = l_X`.\n\n*   **Constraint 2: Parity Conservation**\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity `P_f` is the product of the parity of the final nucleon system `P(NN_f)`, the intrinsic parity of particle X `P(X)`, and the orbital parity of X's motion `P(l_X)`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n    *   `P(l_X) = (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   So, the conservation equation is `P_i = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P(l_X)`.\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    *   This requires `(-1)^(L_f + l_X)` to be `-1`, which means `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n\n*   **Constraint 3: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\n    *   The problem states `T(NN_f) = 0`.\n    *   The given Pauli rule is `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Substituting `T_f = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies `S_f + L_f` must be odd. (Because `odd + 1` is even, and `even (mod 2)` is 0).\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now check each of the four proposed transitions against these three constraints. The spectroscopic notation for X is `s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3`.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   `NN(f)` is `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   `X` is `f`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J Cons:** `J_f = l_X`?  `3 = 3`. **(OK)**\n2.  **P Cons:** `L_f + l_X` = odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. **(OK)**\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. **(OK)**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   `NN(f)` is `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   `X` is `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J Cons:** `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n2.  **P Cons:** `L_f + l_X` = odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. **(OK)**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   `NN(f)` is `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   `X` is `s`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J Cons:** `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. **(OK)**\n2.  **P Cons:** `L_f + l_X` = odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. **(OK)**\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 1 = 2` (even). **(FAIL)**\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for a `T=0` final NN state.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   `NN(f)` is `7D1`: `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   `X` is `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Note: A two-nucleon system (each with spin 1/2) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Therefore, a state with `S=3` (`2S+1=7`) is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. This means the transition is forbidden because the final state cannot exist. However, the question asks to make use of the specified conservation laws and the Pauli rule. Let's strictly apply the given rules:\n1.  **J Cons:** `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n2.  **P Cons:** `L_f + l_X` = odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. **(OK)**\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` = odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. **(OK)**\n*   This transition passes all the rules given in the problem statement. The reason it is forbidden is due to a more fundamental fact not listed in the checks (the composition of the NN system).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhen strictly applying the rules provided in the question (conservation of angular momentum, parity, and the given Pauli statistics rule), only option C fails the test. Option D is forbidden for a more fundamental reason (the final state is physically impossible), but it does not violate the specific rules the question asks to be checked. Therefore, option C is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
