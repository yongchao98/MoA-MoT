    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   The starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n*   Let's break down the name to determine its structure:\n    *   `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`: This describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring. The numbers [4.1.0] indicate that the bridgehead carbons (let's call them C1 and C6) are connected by a path of 4 carbons (C2-C3-C4-C5), a path of 1 carbon (which is actually the other side of the epoxide, but this notation means a 3-membered ring is fused to a 6-membered ring), and a bridge of 0 atoms. The `7-oxa` means atom 7, which is part of the three-membered ring, is an oxygen.\n    *   `1,3,4-trimethyl`: Methyl groups are attached to carbons 1, 3, and 4.\n    *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)`: This defines the absolute stereochemistry at the chiral centers.\n\n*   **Drawing the structure:** We can represent the cyclohexane ring as a planar hexagon with wedges (bonds coming out of the plane, up/beta) and dashes (bonds going into the plane, down/alpha) to show the 3D arrangement.\n    *   From the stereodescriptors (1R, 6S), we can deduce that the epoxide ring and the substituents on the bridgehead carbons (C1-Me and C6-H) are on opposite faces of the cyclohexane ring. We will place the bulky epoxide ring 'up' (beta, wedge). This forces the C1-Me group and the C6-H to be 'down' (alpha, dash).\n    *   For C3 to be R (3R) and C4 to be R (4R), with their respective hydrogens in the back (alpha/dash), the methyl groups at C3 and C4 must both be 'up' (beta, wedge).\n\n*   **Summary of the starting material's stereochemistry:**\n    *   Epoxide ring: up (beta, wedged bonds from C1 and C6 to O).\n    *   Methyl group at C1: down (alpha, dashed bond).\n    *   Hydrogen at C6: down (alpha, dashed bond).\n    *   Methyl group at C3: up (beta, wedged bond).\n    *   Methyl group at C4: up (beta, wedged bond).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n*   **Key Principles (as stated in the problem):**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   **Hindrance at C1:** C1 is a *quaternary* carbon, bonded to a methyl group in addition to the three ring carbons (C2, C6, O). Backside attack (required for Sₙ2) on the C1-O bond would have to come from the 'down' (alpha) face, which is sterically blocked by the axial-like methyl group at C1.\n*   **Hindrance at C6:** C6 is a *tertiary* carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom. Backside attack on the C6-O bond would also come from the 'down' (alpha) face, where it would encounter the axial-like hydrogen at C6.\n*   **Conclusion:** A hydrogen atom is much smaller than a methyl group. Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and it will be attacked by the methyl nucleophile.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Structure and Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Attack:** The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C6 from the 'down' (alpha) face.\n*   **Bond breaking/formation:** The C6-O bond breaks. The C1-O bond remains.\n*   **Inversion:** The configuration at C6 is inverted. The original H at C6 (alpha, down) is pushed 'up' (beta). The incoming methyl group attaches to the 'down' (alpha) face of C6.\n*   **Workup:** The resulting alkoxide at C1 is protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Since the original epoxide was 'up', the -OH group will also be 'up' (beta).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product's substituents:**\n    *   At `old C1`: -OH is up (beta), -Me is down (alpha).\n    *   At `old C6`: New -Me is down (alpha), -H is up (beta).\n    *   At `old C3`: -Me is up (beta), -H is down (alpha).\n    *   At `old C4`: -Me is up (beta), -H is down (alpha).\n\n**5. Name the Product and Assign Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol. We need to number the ring according to IUPAC rules.\n*   **Numbering:** The carbon with the -OH group is designated C1. We then number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from C1 gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (where `new C2` = `old C6`, `new C4` = `old C4`, `new C5` = `old C3`).\n    *   Numbering clockwise gives methyl groups at 1, 3, 4, 6.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is preferred over {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   So, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n*   **Assigning R/S Configuration for the Product:** We now determine the absolute configuration at the chiral centers (C1, C2, C4, C5) using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules. We use the planar representation with wedges (up) and dashes (down).\n\n    *   **C1:**\n        *   Priorities: -OH (1) > C2 (has Me) > C6 > -Me (4).\n        *   The lowest priority group (-Me) is 'down' (back).\n        *   The sequence OH → C2 → C6 is **clockwise**.\n        *   Therefore, **C1 is R**.\n\n    *   **C2 (old C6):**\n        *   Priorities: C1 (has OH) > C3 > -Me > -H (4).\n        *   The lowest priority group (-H) is 'up' (front).\n        *   The sequence C1 → C3 → -Me is **counter-clockwise**.\n        *   Since H is in the front, we reverse the result: counter-clockwise becomes clockwise.\n        *   Therefore, **C2 is R**.\n\n    *   **C4 (old C4):**\n        *   Priorities: C5 (has Me) > C3 > -Me > -H (4).\n        *   The lowest priority group (-H) is 'down' (back).\n        *   The sequence C5 → C3 → -Me is **clockwise**.\n        *   Therefore, **C4 is R**.\n\n    *   **C5 (old C3):**\n        *   Priorities: C4 (has Me) > C6 > -Me > -H (4).\n        *   The lowest priority group (-H) is 'down' (back).\n        *   The sequence C4 → C6 → -Me is **clockwise**.\n        *   Therefore, **C5 is R**.\n\n*   The final product has the stereochemistry **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the name and the stereochemistry, the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
