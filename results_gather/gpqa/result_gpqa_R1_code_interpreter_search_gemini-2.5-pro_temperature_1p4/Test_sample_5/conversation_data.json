    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to find the energy spectrum (the allowed energy levels) for a quantum particle of mass `m` moving in a 2D potential given by:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nThe energy levels will be determined by solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation, Hψ = Eψ, where H is the Hamiltonian operator.\n\n**2. Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ). It is often easier to solve the Schrödinger equation if the potential can be separated into independent functions of the Cartesian coordinates (x, y). Let's perform the conversion:\n\n*   The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n*   Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    *   The first term is `1/2 kr^2 = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2)`.\n    *   The second term is `3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`. We can rewrite this as `3/2 k * (r cos(θ))^2 = 3/2 k * x^2`.\n\n*   Now, combine the terms to get the full potential in Cartesian coordinates:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n**3. Formulate the Hamiltonian and Separate Variables**\n\nThe Hamiltonian operator (H) in 2D is the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy operators:\nH = - (ħ²/2m) (∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y²) + V(x, y)\n\nSubstituting our Cartesian potential:\nH = - (ħ²/2m) (∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y²) + 2kx² + 1/2 ky^2\n\nWe can group the terms related to x and y separately:\nH = [ - (ħ²/2m) ∂²/∂x² + 2kx² ] + [ - (ħ²/2m) ∂²/∂y² + 1/2 ky² ]\n\nThis shows that the Hamiltonian is separable into two independent parts:\nH = H_x + H_y\n\nThis means the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the x and y components (E = E_x + E_y), and the problem is reduced to solving two independent 1D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (QHO) problems.\n\n**4. Solve for the Energy of Each 1D Harmonic Oscillator**\n\nThe standard Hamiltonian for a 1D QHO is H = - (ħ²/2m) d²/dq² + 1/2 mω²q², and its energy eigenvalues are E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n*   **For the x-component:**\n    H_x = - (ħ²/2m) ∂²/∂x² + 2kx²\n    Comparing the potential term `V_x = 2kx²` with the standard form `1/2 m(ω_x)²x²`:\n    1/2 m(ω_x)² = 2k\n    (ω_x)² = 4k/m\n    ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\n    E_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n    E_nx = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n*   **For the y-component:**\n    H_y = - (ħ²/2m) ∂²/∂y² + 1/2 ky²\n    Comparing the potential term `V_y = 1/2 ky²` with the standard form `1/2 m(ω_y)²y²`:\n    1/2 m(ω_y)² = 1/2 k\n    (ω_y)² = k/m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n    E_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the individual energies:\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nNow, factor out the common term `ħ * sqrt(k/m)`:\nE = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m). This matches option C.\n\nA) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nD) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\n<<<C>>>"
