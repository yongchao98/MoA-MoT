    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Define initial and final states\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus at rest.\n    *   Rest mass: M.\n    *   Rest-mass energy: `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Let `m1` be the more massive fragment.\n    *   From the problem statement, `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\nWe can work with rest-mass energies directly, as `E = mc^2`.\n*   `m1 * c^2 = 2 * (m2 * c^2)`\n*   `m1 * c^2 + m2 * c^2 = 0.99 * (M * c^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow, we solve this system of two equations:\n1.  Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    `2 * (m2 * c^2) + (m2 * c^2) = 297 GeV`\n    `3 * (m2 * c^2) = 297 GeV`\n    `m2 * c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n2.  Now find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    `m1 * c^2 = 2 * (m2 * c^2) = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nSo, the rest-mass energies of the fragments are `E_rest1 = 198 GeV` and `E_rest2 = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Energy\nThe total energy is conserved. The initial energy (300 GeV) is converted into the final rest-mass energy (297 GeV) and the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T1` and `T2`).\n\n*   `E_initial = E_final`\n*   `M * c^2 = (m1 * c^2 + T1) + (m2 * c^2 + T2)`\n*   `300 GeV = 198 GeV + T1 + 99 GeV + T2`\n*   `300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2`\n\nThis gives the total kinetic energy released, also known as the Q-value of the fission:\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = 300 - 297 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation of Momentum\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. The final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n*   `p_initial = p_final = 0`\n*   `p1 + p2 = 0` => `p1 = -p2`\n*   The magnitudes are equal: `|p1| = |p2|`. Let's call this `p`.\n\n---\n\n### Calculation of T1 using Classical Mechanics\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = (1/2)mv^2` and momentum is `p = mv`.\n\n1.  From conservation of momentum: `m1 * v1 = m2 * v2`.\n2.  Let's find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    `T1 / T2 = ( (1/2)m1*v1^2 ) / ( (1/2)m2*v2^2 ) = (m1/m2) * (v1/v2)^2`\n3.  From momentum conservation, `v1/v2 = m2/m1`. Substitute this into the energy ratio:\n    `T1 / T2 = (m1/m2) * (m2/m1)^2 = m2/m1`.\n4.  Using the rest masses (which are proportional to rest-mass energies):\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2/m1 = (m2*c^2)/(m1*c^2) = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2`.\n    So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n5.  Now use the total kinetic energy equation:\n    `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n---\n\n### Calculation of T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (The Correct Value)\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mcÂ²) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The total energy is also `E = T + mc^2`.\n\n1.  Let's express `(pc)^2` in terms of kinetic energy `T`:\n    `(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`\n    `T^2 + 2T(mc^2) + (mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`\n    `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n2.  From momentum conservation, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n3.  We have a system of two equations:\n    *   `T1 + T2 = 3`  => `T2 = 3 - T1`\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(99)`\n4.  Substitute `T2` and the energy values into the second equation:\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*99`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n5.  The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n6.  Solve for T1:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    This is the correct relativistic value, `T1_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) `T1` value and the classical `T1` value.\n\n*   `Difference = T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, convert the result to Mega-electron Volts (MeV), noting that `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
