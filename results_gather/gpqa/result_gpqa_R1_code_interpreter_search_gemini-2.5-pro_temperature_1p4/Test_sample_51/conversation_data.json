    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atoms in different energy levels in a gas that is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### **1. Understand the Core Question**\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 2 vs. level 1) changes between two different stellar surface conditions:\n1.  **Condition 1 (No spots):** The star has a uniform effective temperature, T1 = 6000 K.\n2.  **Condition 2 (With spots):** The star's overall effective temperature is T2 = 5500 K.\n\nWe need to calculate the ratio of these population ratios: (Ratio at T1) / (Ratio at T2).\n\n### **2. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nIn LTE, the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in a higher energy level (E₂) to a lower energy level (E₁) is given by:\n\nRatio = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   `E₂ - E₁` is the energy difference between the levels (let's call it ΔE).\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### **3. Setting up the Calculation**\n\nLet's define the population ratios for our two conditions:\n*   Ratio₁ (at T₁ = 6000 K) = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n*   Ratio₂ (at T₂ = 5500 K) = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nWe want to find the factor, which is Ratio₁ / Ratio₂:\n\nFactor = Ratio₁ / Ratio₂ = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n\nThe statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) cancel out:\n\nFactor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nUsing the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)), we get:\n\nFactor = exp( [-ΔE / (k * T₁)] - [-ΔE / (k * T₂)] )\nFactor = exp( -ΔE/k * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) )\n\n### **4. Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe problem states that the transition between the energy levels corresponds to a photon with a wavelength (λ) of 1448 Å. The energy of this photon is equal to the energy difference ΔE.\n\nWe can calculate ΔE using the formula ΔE = hc/λ, where h is the Planck constant and c is the speed of light. A useful shortcut in astrophysics is:\n\nΔE (in eV) ≈ 1240 / λ (in nm)\n\nFirst, convert the wavelength from angstroms (Å) to nanometers (nm):\nλ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm\n\nNow, calculate ΔE:\nΔE = 1240 / 144.8 ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n### **5. Final Calculation**\n\nNow we have all the values needed:\n*   ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV\n*   k (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n*   T₁ = 6000 K\n*   T₂ = 5500 K\n\nPlugging these into our factor equation:\nFactor = exp( -8.5635 / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\nLet's compute this step by step:\n*   ΔE / k ≈ 8.5635 / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 99379 K\n*   (1/6000 - 1/5500) ≈ 0.00016667 - 0.00018182 ≈ -0.00001515\n*   Exponent = -99379 * (-0.00001515) ≈ 1.5056\n\nFactor = exp(1.5056) ≈ 4.506\n\nThe calculation can be done precisely with the following Python code.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants and given values\nT1_nospots = 6000  # K\nT2_spots = 5500    # K\nlambda_A = 1448    # Angstroms\nk_eV = 8.617333e-5 # Boltzmann constant in eV/K\n\n# 1. Convert wavelength from Angstroms to nanometers\nlambda_nm = lambda_A / 10.0\n\n# 2. Calculate the energy difference (Delta E) in eV\n# Using the relation: E (eV) = 1240 / lambda (nm)\ndelta_E = 1240 / lambda_nm\n\n# 3. Calculate the factor using the Boltzmann equation ratio\n# Factor = Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots = exp(-Delta_E/k * (1/T1 - 1/T2))\nexponent = (-delta_E / k_eV) * (1 / T1_nospots - 1 / T2_spots)\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(factor)\n```\n<execute_result>\n4.506691129997121\n</execute_result>\n\nThe factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5. This means the ratio of atoms in the higher energy level to the lower one is about 4.5 times greater when the star is hotter (no spots) compared to when it is cooler (with spots).\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1. Identify the Governing Principle**\n\nThe problem asks about the ratio of the number of atoms in different energy levels at different temperatures. Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), this is governed by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ / N₁ is the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy level (level 2) to the lower energy level (level 1).\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### **2. Define the Two Scenarios**\n\n*   **Scenario 1 (No spots):** Temperature T₁ = 6000 K\n    Ratio₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n\n*   **Scenario 2 (With spots):** Temperature T₂ = 5500 K\n    Ratio₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n### **3. Formulate the Required Factor**\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes from the \"with spots\" case to the \"no spots\" case. This means we need to calculate `Ratio₁ / Ratio₂`.\n\nFactor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n\nThe statistical weight term `(g₂ / g₁)` cancels out:\n\nFactor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nUsing the rule of exponents eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ, we simplify the expression:\n\nFactor = exp( [-ΔE / (k * T₁)] - [-ΔE / (k * T₂)] )\nFactor = exp( -ΔE/k * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) )\n\n### **4. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with a wavelength (λ) of 1448 Å. We can use the formula E = hc/λ, but a convenient shortcut in astrophysics is:\n\nE (in eV) ≈ 1240 / λ (in nm)\n\nFirst, convert the wavelength: λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm\n\nΔE = 1240 / 144.8 ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n### **5. Calculate the Final Factor**\n\nNow, we plug in the known values into our derived formula.\n\n*   ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV\n*   k (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n*   T₁ = 6000 K\n*   T₂ = 5500 K\n\nExponent = (-ΔE / k) * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂)\nExponent ≈ (-8.5635 / 8.617 x 10⁻⁵) * (1/6000 - 1/5500)\nExponent ≈ (-99379) * (0.00016667 - 0.00018182)\nExponent ≈ (-99379) * (-0.00001515)\nExponent ≈ 1.5057\n\nFactor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507\n\nThis value is very close to 4.5. The Python code execution confirms this result.\n\nThe ratio of populations `N₂/N₁` is approximately 4.5 times larger when the star is hotter (6000 K, no spots) than when it is cooler (5500 K, with spots).\n\n<<<A>>>"
