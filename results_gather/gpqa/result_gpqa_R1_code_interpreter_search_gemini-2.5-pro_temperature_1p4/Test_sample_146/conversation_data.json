    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:** The fundamental principle we will use is the conservation of energy. In this annihilation process, the total energy before the reaction must be equal to the total energy after the reaction.\n\n2.  **Initial State Energy ($E_{initial}$):**\n    *   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common simplification in such problems, implying that the kinetic energy of the particles is negligible compared to their rest mass energy. We can assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n    *   The energy of a particle at rest is given by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula, $E = mc^2$.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical. The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton:\n        $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n        $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n3.  **Final State Energy ($E_{final}$):**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they are antiparticles of each other, they have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   The problem states that the rest mass energy of particle A ($m_A c^2$) is 300 MeV.\n    *   After the annihilation, the resulting particles will be moving at a high velocity, $v$. The total energy of a single moving particle A is its relativistic energy, given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   Since there are four such particles, the total final energy is:\n        $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n4.  **Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   We equate the initial and final energies:\n        $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n        $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    *   We can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Plugging in the known values:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n5.  **Solving for Velocity (v):**\n    *   Now we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity $v$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $v/c$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.7688c$.\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        A) 0.91c\n        B) 0.96c\n        C) 0.86c\n        D) 0.77c\n    *   The calculated value is closest to 0.77c.\n\nTo ensure precision, let's use a script for the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants from the problem statement and known physical values\nm_p_c2 = 938.27  # Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300     # Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) using the conservation of energy\n# E_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n# E_final = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# E_initial = E_final  =>  2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Calculate the velocity (v) as a fraction of the speed of light (c)\n# from the definition of gamma: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# Rearranging gives: v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nv_over_c = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {v_over_c:.2f}c\")\n```\n>\n> The velocity of particle A is 0.77c\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user has provided the output of the code I generated. The code calculated the velocity of particle A to be 0.77c. This confirms the result of my manual calculation.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n2.  **Initial Energy**: The initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton (assuming they are at rest). $E_{initial} = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n3.  **Final Energy**: The final energy is the total relativistic energy of the four A particles produced. $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$. We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n4.  **Equation**: By setting $E_{initial} = E_{final}$, we get $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$.\n5.  **Solve for Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{4 \\times 300} = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$.\n6.  **Solve for Velocity (v)**: Using the formula $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$, we find $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/(1.5638)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$.\n7.  **Conclusion**: The velocity $v$ is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nThe calculation matches option D. The python code confirmed this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
