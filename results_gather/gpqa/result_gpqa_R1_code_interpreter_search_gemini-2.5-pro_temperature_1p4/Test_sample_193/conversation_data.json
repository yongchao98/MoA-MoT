    "The user wants to find the partition function Z for a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3.\nEach spin can take one of two values: +1 or -1.\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all possible configurations (states) of the system of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\nThe system has three spins, and each can be in one of two states. Therefore, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8.\nWe need to calculate the energy E for each of these 8 states, and then sum their corresponding Boltzmann factors.\n\nLet's list all 8 possible states and calculate their energies:\nA state is represented by the triplet (S1, S2, S3).\n\n1.  **State (+1, +1, +1):**\n    S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -J * 3 = -3J\n\n2.  **State (+1, +1, -1):**\n    S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n3.  **State (+1, -1, +1):**\n    S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n4.  **State (-1, +1, +1):**\n    S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n5.  **State (+1, -1, -1):**\n    S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n6.  **State (-1, +1, -1):**\n    S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n7.  **State (-1, -1, +1):**\n    S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n8.  **State (-1, -1, -1):**\n    S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -J * 3 = -3J\n\nNow, let's group the states by their energy level to find the degeneracy (the number of states with the same energy).\n\n*   **Energy Level E1 = -3J:**\n    This energy occurs for two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    The degeneracy is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level E2 = J:**\n    This energy occurs for the other six states: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\nThe total number of states is g1 + g2 = 2 + 6 = 8, which is correct.\n\nThe partition function Z can now be written as the sum over the energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
