    "Here's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct sequence of reactions:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's break down its structure:\n    *   A benzene ring.\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n    The substituents are adjacent to each other on the ring (1, 2, 3 substitution pattern).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Substituents and Their Directing Effects:**\n    In Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS), the existing groups on the ring direct where the new group will go.\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Activating, ortho, para-director. It's very bulky, which can hinder substitution at the ortho positions.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Retrosynthesis Strategy (Working Backwards):**\n    *   **Step a: Introducing the ethoxy group.** An ethoxy group is typically added via the Williamson ether synthesis. This requires a phenol (-OH group) as a precursor. The reaction is `Ar-OH + base (e.g., NaOH) -> Ar-O-`, followed by `Ar-O- + ethyl halide (e.g., EtBr) -> Ar-OEt`.\n        *   So, the immediate precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Note: When -OH is present, it gets numbering priority as the parent 'phenol', so C1 has the OH. The other groups are at C2 and C3, hence the name 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol).\n    *   **Step b: Creating the phenol group.** A phenol group is commonly made from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. The sequence is `Ar-NH2 --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Ar-N2+ --(H2O, heat)--> Ar-OH`.\n        *   The precursor to our phenol must be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   **Step c: Synthesizing 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.** This molecule has three groups. We need to determine the order of their introduction. Let's consider the last addition.\n        *   **Option c1: Nitration.** If we nitrate 2-tert-butylaniline. The amino group (-NH2) is a very strong o,p-director. However, in strong acidic conditions (like HNO3/H2SO4 for nitration), it gets protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a **meta-director**. The t-butyl group at C2 is an o,p-director.\n            *   On 2-tert-butylanilinium, the -NH3+ (at C1) directs to positions 3 and 5.\n            *   The -tBu (at C2) directs to positions 3, 5, and 1 (blocked).\n            *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to positions 3 and 5. The desired product requires nitration at position 3. This is a plausible step.\n        *   **Option c2: Alkylation.** Introducing a t-butyl group onto 3-nitroaniline. Friedel-Crafts alkylation doesn't work well on rings with deactivating groups like -NO2 or with basic groups like -NH2 (which reacts with the AlCl3 catalyst). This path is not viable.\n        *   **Option c3: Reduction.** Starting with 1-tert-butyl-2,3-dinitrobenzene and selectively reducing one nitro group. Creating 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivatives like this can be very difficult. Nitrating 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene would direct the second nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not 3.\n    *   **Conclusion from Step c:** The most likely path to 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is the nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   **Step d: Synthesizing 2-tert-butylaniline.** This is easily made by reducing the corresponding nitro compound, 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. A common reagent for this is Fe/HCl or Sn/HCl.\n    *   **Step e: Synthesizing 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.** This comes from the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director. Nitration will produce a mixture of ortho (the desired product) and para isomers. The para isomer is usually the major product due to less steric hindrance. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, this step is not ideal, but it's a standard reaction. A blocking group strategy could be used to improve the yield of the ortho product, but let's stick to the simplest path first.\n    *   **Step f: Synthesizing tert-butylbenzene.** This is done by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene using tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Forward Synthesis and Compare with Options:**\n    Based on our retrosynthesis, the forward reaction sequence is:\n    1.  **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**  -> tert-butylbenzene\n    2.  **tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4** -> 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (+ para isomer)\n    3.  **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl** -> 2-tert-butylaniline\n    4.  **2-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4** -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline\n    5.  **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl** -> Diazonium salt\n    6.  **Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat** -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol\n    7.  **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr** -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene (Final Product)\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   **A)** Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts. Friedel-Crafts on aniline is problematic as the catalyst reacts with the amine. Also, step (vi) `SO3/H2SO4` on a diazonium salt is chemically incorrect. **Option A is wrong.**\n    *   **B)** After making nitro-tert-butylbenzene, it tries to sulfonate it. The subsequent steps are illogical. **Option B is wrong.**\n    *   **C)** Let's match its steps with our derived sequence:\n        *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` - Matches step 1.\n        *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` - Matches step 2.\n        *   iii) `Fe/HCl` - Matches step 3.\n        *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` - Matches step 4.\n        *   v) `NaNO2/HCl` - Matches step 5.\n        *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` - Matches step 6.\n        *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr` - Matches step 7.\n        This sequence perfectly matches our logical synthesis. The option includes two additional, unnecessary steps (viii, ix) at the end, which are likely typos in the question. However, the core synthesis (i-vii) is the most plausible route among all choices.\n    *   **D)** It attempts a blocking group strategy (`SO3/H2SO4` at step ii) but then follows with an incorrect sequence of reactions (e.g., reducing the nitro group before removing the blocking group, and attempting to nitrate a diazonium salt). **Option D is wrong.**\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Option C outlines the most chemically sound pathway to synthesize the target molecule, despite potential regioselectivity issues and two superfluous steps listed at the end. The other options contain fundamental chemical errors. Therefore, C is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
