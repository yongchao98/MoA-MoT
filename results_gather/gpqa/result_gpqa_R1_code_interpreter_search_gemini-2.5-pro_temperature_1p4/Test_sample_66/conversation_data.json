    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and the measurement:**\n    *   The initial state of the 2-electron system is a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons (since they are in p orbitals).\n    *   $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m=-1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   The measurement to be performed is of the individual orbital angular momentum z-components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n\n2.  **Identify the desired final state:**\n    *   The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$.\n    *   So, we are looking for the outcome where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   This outcome corresponds to the system being found in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum:**\n    *   The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-component operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   When a measurement is performed, the eigenvalues must also add up. If a measurement of $L_{1z}$ yields $m_1\\hbar$ and a measurement of $L_{2z}$ yields $m_2\\hbar$, then the total z-component is $(m_1 + m_2)\\hbar$.\n    *   The initial state is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. This means that any measurement of the individual components $m_1$ and $m_2$ *must* satisfy the condition $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n    *   In our case, the initial state has $m=-1$. The desired measurement outcome has $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if this outcome is consistent with the initial state: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since the sum of the measured z-components ($m_{sum}=-2$) is not equal to the definite total z-component of the initial state ($m=-1$), this outcome is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Formal Calculation using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\n    The probability of finding the system in the state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ after the measurement is given by the square of the amplitude of this state in the expansion of the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$. This amplitude is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n    The expansion is:\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} <l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m> |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$\n\n    The probability P is:\n    $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$, are non-zero only if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied.\n    *   For the initial state, $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state, $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The sum is $m_1 + m_2 = -2$.\n    *   Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (i.e., $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n    $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$\n\n    Therefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Consequently, the probability of observing this outcome is exactly zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
