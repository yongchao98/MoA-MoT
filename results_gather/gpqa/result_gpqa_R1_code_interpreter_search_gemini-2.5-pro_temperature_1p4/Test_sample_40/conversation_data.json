    "Here's the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame of reference, which is considered stationary.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference in which the glass is at rest. This frame is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the Glass Frame (S') relative to the Lab Frame (S):** This is given as `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of light in the Glass Frame (u'):** The problem states that the index of refraction of the glass is `n`. The speed of light *in* a medium is given by `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light as measured by an observer at rest with respect to the glass is `u' = 1/n`. The problem specifies that the light beam is moving in the *same direction* as the glass, so we take `u'` as positive.\n    *   **Velocity of light in the Laboratory Frame (u):** This is the quantity we need to find. It is the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    Classical (Galilean) relativity would simply add the velocities: `u = u' + v`. However, for speeds approaching the speed of light, we must use Einstein's relativistic velocity addition formula. For velocities in the same direction, the formula is:\n    \n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We have the following values:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    \n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Now, we simplify the algebraic expression:\n    \n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To clear the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    \n    `u = [n * (1/n + v)] / [n * (1 + v/n)]`\n    \n    Distribute the `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    \n    `u = (n/n + n*v) / (n*1 + n*v/n)`\n    \n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) 1\n    D) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n    Our result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
