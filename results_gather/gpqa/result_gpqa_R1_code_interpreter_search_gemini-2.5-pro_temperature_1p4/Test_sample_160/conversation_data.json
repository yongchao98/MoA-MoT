    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Mean Free Path (MFP):** This is the average distance a particle travels before it collides with another particle. The general concept is `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`, where `n` is the number density of target particles and `σ` is the collision cross-section (the effective area of the target).\n    *   **λ1:** This is the MFP of gas molecules colliding with *each other*.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the MFP of electrons from a beam colliding with the *same* gas molecules.\n    *   The problem asks for the relationship between `λ2` and `λ1`, given that the gas conditions (number density `n`, temperature `T`) are the same.\n\n2.  **Analyze the MFP for Gas Molecules (λ1):**\n    *   In a gas, all molecules are moving. This makes collisions more frequent than if the target molecules were stationary.\n    *   The standard formula for the MFP of a molecule in a gas of identical molecules is:\n        `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_mol)`\n    *   Here, `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_mol` is the collision cross-section for two molecules hitting each other. In a simple hard-sphere model, if a molecule has a diameter `d`, the cross-section is the area of a circle with radius `d` (since the center of one molecule cannot get closer than `d` to the center of another). So, `σ_mol = π * d²`.\n    *   The `√2` factor is crucial; it accounts for the average relative velocity between the moving gas molecules.\n    *   Substituting `σ_mol`, the formula becomes: `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²)`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the MFP for Electrons (λ2):**\n    *   Now, the projectiles are electrons, and the targets are the gas molecules.\n    *   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they travel at velocities extremely close to the speed of light. The thermal velocity of the gas molecules (a few hundred m/s) is negligible in comparison.\n    *   Therefore, we can treat the gas molecules as *stationary targets* for the ultra-fast electrons. The `√2` factor for relative motion does not apply here.\n    *   The formula for the MFP of a particle moving through stationary targets is:\n        `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-mol)`\n    *   Here, `n` is the same gas molecule number density.\n    *   `σ_e-mol` is the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a molecule. In a simple hard-sphere model, the electron is considered a point particle (radius ≈ 0) and the molecule is a sphere of diameter `d` (radius `d/2`). The collision cross-section is the area of the target molecule.\n    *   So, `σ_e-mol = π * (radius_of_molecule)² = π * (d/2)² = π * d² / 4`.\n    *   Substituting this into the formula for `λ2`:\n        `λ2 = 1 / (n * (π * d² / 4)) = 4 / (n * π * d²)`.\n\n4.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   We have the two expressions:\n        `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²)`\n        `λ2 = 4 / (n * π * d²) `\n    *   To find the relationship, let's calculate the ratio `λ2 / λ1`:\n        `λ2 / λ1 = [ 4 / (n * π * d²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²) ]`\n    *   The `(n * π * d²)` terms cancel out, leaving:\n        `λ2 / λ1 = 4 * √2`\n    *   Now, let's calculate the numerical value. We know `√2 ≈ 1.414`.\n        `λ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656`\n    *   This means `λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The result `λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1` clearly shows that `λ2` is significantly larger than `λ1`.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1\n        B) λ2 < λ1\n        C) λ2 = λ1\n        D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1\n    *   Our calculated ratio of ~5.66 fits perfectly into the condition stated in option A (`5.66 >= 1.22`).\n    *   Option B is incorrect.\n    *   Option C is incorrect.\n    *   Option D is incorrect because 5.66 is not less than 1.22.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** The mean free path of the electrons (`λ2`) is substantially larger than the mean free path of the gas molecules (`λ1`). The primary reasons are: 1) the effective target size for an electron-molecule collision is smaller than for a molecule-molecule collision, and 2) the gas molecules are effectively stationary relative to the high-speed electrons, which increases the mean free path compared to the case where all particles are moving randomly. The hard-sphere model predicts `λ2 = 4√2 * λ1`, which strongly supports option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
