    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The core principle to solve this problem is the conservation of total energy. In a relativistic system, the total energy ($E$) is the sum of the relativistic energy of the particle and its potential energy ($U$).\n    $E = E_{relativistic} + U(x)$\n    The relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ is given by $E_{relativistic} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. Note that this term includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    So, the total conserved energy of the system is:\n    $E = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude (x = A):**\n    At the point of maximum amplitude, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction.\n    *   Position: $x = A$\n    *   Speed: $v = 0$\n    At this point, the relativistic energy term becomes the rest energy, since $\\gamma=1$ for $v=0$. The potential energy is at its maximum.\n    *   $E_{relativistic}(v=0) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = mc^2$\n    *   $U(x=A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n    Therefore, the total energy of the system is:\n    $E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n    Since energy is conserved, this is the total energy at all points in the motion.\n\n3.  **Energy at the Equilibrium Position (x = 0):**\n    At the equilibrium position, the mass is moving at its maximum speed.\n    *   Position: $x = 0$\n    *   Speed: $v = v_{max}$\n    At this point, the potential energy is zero. The kinetic energy and the speed are at their maximum.\n    *   $E_{relativistic}(v=v_{max}) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   $U(x=0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$\n    Therefore, the total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n4.  **Equating the Energies and Solving for v_max:**\n    By the principle of energy conservation, the total energy at the maximum amplitude must be equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    Energy at $x=A$ = Energy at $x=0$\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Now, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$:\n    *   Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    *   To isolate the square root term, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n\n    *   Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n        $\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n        $\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $v_{max}^2/c^2$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The derived expression for the maximum speed is $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
