    "This is a problem of special relativity that involves time dilation. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S). This is considered the \"stationary\" frame for this problem.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S'). This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the given quantities:**\n    *   The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`. (The problem states the speed of the Galaxy relative to the ejecta is 60,000 km/s; by the principle of relativity, the magnitude of the velocity is the same from either reference frame).\n    *   The time interval measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame), `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the proper time because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in the moving frame.\n    *   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the plan:**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is given by `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame.\n    *   The time `Δt` in the stationary frame (Galaxy) is related to the proper time `Δt₀` in the moving frame (ejecta) by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor, `γ` (gamma), is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Execute the calculations:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate `(v/c)²`:\n        `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   Calculate the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance `d`:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n6.  **Compute the final value:**\n    To get a numerical value for the distance, we can use a python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # speed of ejecta in km/s\nt0 = 50  # proper time in seconds in the ejecta's frame\nc = 300000  # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the time dilation factor (gamma)\nbeta_squared = (v/c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame\nt_galaxy = gamma * t0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance_galaxy = v * t_galaxy\n\nprint(distance_galaxy)\n```\n<execute_result>\n3061862.178478726\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. Looking at the options:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 3,000,000 km\nD) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 3,060,000 km. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's design (using an approximation for the Lorentz factor, `1/sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.02`).\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user's question is a classic special relativity problem involving time dilation.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The \"stationary\" frame is the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n    *   The \"moving\" frame is the ejecta's reference frame (S').\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s` (a standard value).\n    *   The time interval measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock that is at rest relative to the events it is timing (i.e., the clock is on the ejecta).\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. Let's call this `d_galaxy`. The formula for distance is `distance = speed × time`. The time in this formula must also be the time measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Time Dilation Formula:**\n    *   An observer in the Galaxy frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt_galaxy`) compared to the proper time (`Δt₀`) measured in the ejecta's frame (S'). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The formula for time dilation is: `Δt_galaxy = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step a: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step b: Calculate the Lorentz factor, γ.**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n    *   **Step c: Calculate the dilated time in the Galaxy's frame, Δt_galaxy.**\n        `Δt_galaxy = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n    *   **Step d: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        `d_galaxy = v * Δt_galaxy`\n        `d_galaxy = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s`\n        `d_galaxy ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 2,940,000 km\n    B) 2,880,000 km\n    C) 3,000,000 km\n    D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
