    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between the two astronauts.\nb) The total energy ($E$) of the system.\n\n**2. List the Given Information:**\n*   Mass of the first astronaut, $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, $v_1 = 0.6c$ (in the positive x-direction)\n*   Mass of the second astronaut, $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, $v_2 = 0.5c$ (in the positive x-direction)\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$):**\nSince the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light (relativistic), we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find the relative speed. The formula for the relative velocity of object 1 with respect to object 2, when they are moving in the same direction, is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nTo compare with the options, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857... c$\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\nThe total energy of a system is the sum of the total energies of its individual components. The total energy ($E$) of a single particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula:\n$E = \\gamma m c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n**a) Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$:\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_1^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Now, calculate the energy $E_1$:\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**b) Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$:\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_2^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}}$\n    $\\sqrt{0.75} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n*   Now, calculate the energy $E_2$:\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n\n**c) Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$):**\n*   Sum the energies $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n    $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n*   To compare with the options, calculate the numerical value. We know $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$:\n    $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 2 \\times 1.732) mc^2$\n    $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2$\n    $E_{total} \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**5.

    "### Final Answer Explanation\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula, as their speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. The formula for the velocity of astronaut 1 as observed from astronaut 2's reference frame is:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428... c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **$v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of a system is the sum of the total energies of its individual components. The relativistic total energy of a particle is given by:\n\n$E = \\gamma m c^2$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\n**a) Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**b) Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}) \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**c) Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n*   $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **$E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$ and $E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
