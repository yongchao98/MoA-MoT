    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and relativistic particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the core physics:** The problem deals with unstable particles decaying as they travel. The number of particles, `N`, that survive after a time `t` in their own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ` (tau) is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Apply Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory (the detector), the particle's internal clock runs slower. The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (`t_lab_lifetime`) is dilated by the Lorentz factor, `γ` (gamma).\n    `t_lab_lifetime = γ * τ`\n\n3.  **Formulate the survival equation in the lab frame:** The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the detector wall (a distance `R`) is `t_travel = R / v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_travel ≈ R / c`.\n\n    The fraction of particles that survive the journey to the wall is given by the decay law, using the time elapsed in the lab frame (`t_travel`) and the dilated lifetime in the lab frame (`t_lab_lifetime`):\n    `N / N₀ = exp(-t_travel / t_lab_lifetime)`\n    Substituting the expressions we found:\n    `N / N₀ = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ))`\n    `N / N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n4.  **Analyze the two given scenarios:**\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n        *   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `N₁ / N₀ = 1/3`.\n        *   The equation is: `1/3 = exp(-R / (20 * c * τ))`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n        *   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `N₂ / N₀ = 2/3`.\n        *   The equation is: `2/3 = exp(-R / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n\n5.  **Solve for the unknown `γ₂`:** The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this particle and detector system. Let's call this constant `C`. `C = R / (c * τ)`.\n\n    *   From Scenario 1:\n        `1/3 = exp(-C / 20)`\n        Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -C / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -C / 20`\n        `C = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   From Scenario 2:\n        `2/3 = exp(-C / γ₂)`\n        Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -C / γ₂`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -C / γ₂`\n        `ln(1.5) = C / γ₂`\n        `γ₂ = C / ln(1.5)`\n\n    *   Now substitute the expression for `C` we found from Scenario 1 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the numerical value:** We can use Python to get a precise value for `γ₂`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of gamma_2 based on the derived formula\n# gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n```output\n54.18956983115451\n```\n\nThe calculated value for `γ₂` is approximately 54.19. This corresponds to option C.\n\n***\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning that leads to the solution.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics of Particle Decay**\n\nThe problem involves relativistic particles that decay over time. The fundamental formula for the number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law:\n\n`N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`\n\nHere, `τ` (tau) is the **proper mean lifetime** of the particle, which is the lifetime measured in the particle's own rest frame.\n\n### **2. Incorporate Special Relativity (Time Dilation)**\n\nFrom the perspective of the laboratory (the detector), the particle is moving at a very high speed. According to special relativity, a moving clock runs slower than a stationary one. This effect is called time dilation.\n\nThe lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (`t_lab_lifetime`) is longer than its proper lifetime `τ` by a factor of `γ` (the Lorentz factor):\n\n`t_lab_lifetime = γ * τ`\n\nThe decay law as observed in the lab frame becomes:\n\n`N(t_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ))`\n\n### **3. Set up the Equations for the Given Scenarios**\n\nThe time it takes for a particle to travel the radius `R` of the detector in the lab frame is `t_travel = R / v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n\nSo, `t_travel ≈ R / c`.\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall is `N / N₀`. We can substitute `t_travel` for `t_lab` in our decay equation:\n\n`N / N₀ = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. This constant depends on the detector size and the particle's intrinsic properties, which do not change between the two scenarios. The equation simplifies to:\n\n`N / N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nNow, we can apply this formula to the two scenarios described in the problem.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   Fraction of surviving particles, `N₁ / N₀ = 1/3`\n    *   Equation: `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?`\n    *   Fraction of surviving particles, `N₂ / N₀ = 2/3`\n    *   Equation: `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n### **4. Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n\nOur goal is to find `γ₂`. We have a system of two equations with two unknowns (`K` and `γ₂`). We can solve for `K` using the first equation and then use that value to solve for `γ₂` in the second equation.\n\n*   **From Scenario 1:**\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n*   **From Scenario 2:**\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(x/y) = -ln(y/x)`:\n    `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n    `γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)` or `γ₂ = K / ln(1.5)`\n\n*   **Substitute the value of K:**\n    Now substitute the expression for `K` from Scenario 1 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)`\n\n### **5. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nThe python code executed this exact formula:\n`γ₂ = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)`\nWhich gave the result:\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nLooking at the multiple-choice options:\nA) 40\nB) 28\nC) 54\nD) 68\n\nThe calculated value of `~54.2` is closest to **54**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
