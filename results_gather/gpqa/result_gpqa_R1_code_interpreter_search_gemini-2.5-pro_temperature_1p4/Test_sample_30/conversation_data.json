    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\nThe first reaction is the treatment of toluene with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, the major product will be the para-substituted isomer.\n*   **Reactant:** Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃)\n*   **Reagents:** HNO₃, H₂SO₄\n*   **Reaction:** Nitration\n*   **Product 1:** p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene)\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\nProduct 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This reagent mixture is an oxidizing agent. It oxidizes the methyl group attached to the benzene ring. While strong oxidation could lead to a carboxylic acid, MnO₂ is well-known for the selective oxidation of benzylic positions to the aldehyde stage. In the context of a multi-step synthesis problem, creating an aldehyde is a common strategy as it sets up for subsequent condensation reactions. Therefore, it is most plausible that the methyl group is oxidized to an aldehyde group.\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene)\n*   **Reagents:** MnO₂, H₂SO₄\n*   **Reaction:** Oxidation of the benzylic methyl group.\n*   **Product 2:** p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde)\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\nProduct 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a base-catalyzed aldol-type condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, because it occurs between an aldehyde (with no α-hydrogens) and a ketone (with α-hydrogens).\n1.  The base (NaOH) removes an α-proton from acetone to form an enolate nucleophile (`⁻CH₂COCH₃`).\n2.  The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n3.  An aldol addition product is formed, which then readily undergoes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) under the reaction conditions. This is because the resulting carbon-carbon double bond is conjugated with both the benzene ring and the carbonyl group, which leads to a very stable product.\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) and acetone\n*   **Reagents:** NaOH (aq)\n*   **Reaction:** Claisen-Schmidt Condensation\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The trans (E) isomer is the major product due to lower steric hindrance. The structure is `O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(O)CH₃`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\nNow we must determine the point group for (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\nLet's analyze its structure for symmetry elements.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule has an extended conjugated system: the nitro group, the benzene ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O double bond. To maximize π-orbital overlap, this entire backbone prefers a planar conformation.\n2.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Let's consider the plane that contains the heavy-atom backbone: `O-N-O`, `C₆H₄` ring, `-CH=CH-`, `-C(O)C-`. This plane includes all atoms except for the two hydrogens of the vinyl group (`-CH=CH-`) and the three hydrogens of the methyl group (`-CH₃`). The vinyl hydrogens lie in this plane. The methyl group's carbon atom lies in this plane. The methyl group can rotate around its C-C bond. A low-energy conformation exists where one of the methyl C-H bonds is also in this plane, and the other two H atoms are positioned symmetrically, one above and one below the plane. In this conformation, the plane containing the molecular backbone acts as a mirror plane. It maps the hydrogen atom above the plane to the one below the plane, and all atoms lying within the plane are mapped onto themselves. Therefore, the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (σ).\n3.  **Rotation Axes (Cₙ, n>1):** There are no proper axes of rotation. Rotating the molecule by any angle other than 360° will not result in an identical structure because the two ends of the molecule are different (a nitro group vs. an acetyl group).\n4.  **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n5.  **Improper Rotation Axes (Sₙ):** Since there are no Cₙ axes (for n>1), there can be no Sₙ axes (for n>2). An S₁ is equivalent to a plane of symmetry (which we have), and an S₂ is equivalent to a center of inversion (which we do not have).\n\nThe molecule possesses only two symmetry elements: the identity (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ). A point group containing only these two elements is designated as **Cₛ**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) C₂h - Incorrect.\nB) C₃ - Incorrect.\nC) Cₛ - Correct.\nD) D₂h - Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
