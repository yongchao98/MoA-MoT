    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the options.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   \"None of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\" indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this information.\n    *   The crucial pieces of information are the complex splitting patterns (multiplicities):\n        1.  One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n        2.  A different signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n### **2. Understand the Splitting Patterns**\n\nTo predict these complex patterns, we use the (n+1) rule for each group of non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n*   **dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets):** This pattern arises when a proton (or a group of equivalent protons) is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   A group of **one** proton (n=1, split into a doublet).\n    *   A group of **two** equivalent protons (n=2, split into a triplet).\n    *   A group of **three** equivalent protons (n=3, split into a quartet).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a `CH` proton that is adjacent to another `CH`, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n\n*   **dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets):** This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   A group of **one** proton (n=1, split into a doublet).\n    *   A group of **two** equivalent protons (n=2, split into a triplet).\n    *   Another, different group of **two** equivalent protons (n=2, split into another triplet).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a `CH` proton that is adjacent to another `CH` group and two different `CH₂` groups.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Structure of Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each candidate molecule to see if its structure can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. The condensed formulas can be ambiguous, so we must carefully deduce the structure.\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n          CH₃\n          |\n(CH₃)₂CH(4)-CH(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H at C3:** Neighbors are H at C4 (1H), the C3-methyl (3H), and the CH₂ at C2 (2H). This proton would indeed be a **dtq**.\n*   **H at C4:** Neighbors are H at C3 (1H) and the two C4-methyl groups (6H). This proton would be a doublet of septets (ds).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtq` but no `dtt`. So, A is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n           CH₃     CH₃\n           |       |\nCH₃CH₂(4)-CH(3)-CH(2)-COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H at C3:** Neighbors are H at C2 (1H), the C3-methyl (3H), and the CH₂ at C4 (2H). This proton is a **dtq**.\n*   **H at C2:** Neighbors are H at C3 (1H) and the C2-methyl (3H). This is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtq` but no `dtt`. So, C is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n           CH₂CH₃     CH₂CH₃\n           |           |\nCH₃CH₂(4)-CH(3)----CH(2)----COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H at C3:** Neighbors are H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of the C3-ethyl group (2H). This proton is a **dtt**.\n*   **H at C2:** Neighbors are H at C3 (1H) and the CH₂ of the C2-ethyl group (2H). This is a doublet of triplets (dt).\n*   **Methylene protons:** The protons on the various CH₂ groups are diastereotopic and would give complex `ddq` signals, not a `dtq`.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtt` but no `dtq`. So, D is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\nThis is the most plausible structure from the formula. The backbone is a pentanoic acid chain starting from the terminal CH₃.\n```\n           CH₂(e)CH₃(f)   <-- C4-ethyl\n           |\nCH₃(h)-CH(g)----CH(b)----CH₂(a)----COOH(1)\n           |\n           CH₂(c)CH₃(d)   <-- C3-ethyl\n```\nLet's analyze the key methine (`CH`) protons:\n*   **Proton H(b) at C3:**\n    *   Neighbors: The CH₂ group at C2 (2H, `triplet`), the CH group at C4 (1H, `doublet`), and the CH₂ group of the C3-ethyl sidechain (2H, `triplet`).\n    *   Predicted splitting: **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **Proton H(g) at C4:**\n    *   Neighbors: The CH group at C3 (1H, `doublet`), the CH₂ group of the C4-ethyl sidechain (2H, `triplet`), and the terminal CH₃ group at C5 (3H, `quartet`).\n    *   Predicted splitting: **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nStructure B, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only compound among the choices that has a proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal (the proton at C3) and another distinct proton environment that would produce a `dtq` signal (the proton at C4). Therefore, this is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
