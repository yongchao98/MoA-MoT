    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have a neutral spherical conductor with a cavity. A positive point charge, +q, is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:**\n    *   The positive charge +q inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the conductor, i.e., the wall of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we consider a Gaussian surface just outside the cavity but still within the conducting material, the electric field must be zero. To make the net charge inside this Gaussian surface zero, a total charge of **-q** must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of -q has been drawn to the inner surface, a corresponding charge of **+q** must be left behind on the conductor. In electrostatic equilibrium, this excess charge will reside on the *outer surface* of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of a closed conducting shell is that it provides electrostatic shielding. This means:\n    *   The charges on the outer surface and any charges external to the conductor are shielded from the electric fields created by the charges inside the cavity (the original +q and the induced -q).\n    *   Conversely, the charges inside the cavity are shielded from any external electric fields.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   Because of electrostatic shielding, the +q charge on the outer surface distributes itself as if the charges inside the cavity do not exist.\n    *   The only factor determining the distribution of this +q charge is the shape of the surface it is on. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere, the charge +q will spread out **uniformly** over the outer surface to minimize electrostatic repulsion.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:**\n    *   The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields created by all charges. However, the field created by the charge +q inside the cavity and the induced charge -q on the cavity wall is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity due to the shielding effect of the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is produced *solely* by the uniform distribution of charge +q on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   A well-known result from Gauss's Law (also known as Newton's Shell Theorem for electrostatics) is that the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = +q.\n    *   Center of the outer sphere = Center of the conductor (point O).\n    *   Distance from the center O to the point P = L.\n    *   Using the formula for the electric field of a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The information about the cavity's radius (r), its position (s), the distance from the cavity's center to P (l), and the angle (Î¸) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are \"distractor\" variables. The shielding property of the conductor simplifies the problem significantly.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived formula matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
