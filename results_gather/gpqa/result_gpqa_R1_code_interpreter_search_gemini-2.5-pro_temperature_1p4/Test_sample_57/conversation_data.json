    "*   **Analysis of the Question:** The question asks which of the listed physical theories does not need a procedure called \"regularization\" to handle problems that arise at high energies (or, equivalently, very short distances).\n\n*   **Understanding Regularization:** In quantum field theory (QFT), when we calculate physical quantities like the probability of particles interacting, the calculations often involve integrals over all possible energies and momenta of virtual particles. These integrals frequently \"blow up\" to infinity, a problem known as an ultraviolet (UV) divergence. Regularization is a mathematical technique used to tame these infinities, essentially by introducing a temporary, artificial limit or \"cutoff\" on the high energies being considered. This allows for a subsequent step, renormalization, where the infinities are systematically absorbed into the definition of physical constants (like mass and charge), leaving finite, predictive results. A theory that requires this process has high-energy divergences.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the QFT describing the strong nuclear force. Like other QFTs, its perturbative calculations are plagued by UV divergences in loop diagrams. Therefore, QCD *requires* regularization and renormalization to make physical predictions.\n\n    *   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the QFT of the electromagnetic force. It was the first theory where the techniques of regularization and renormalization were successfully applied. It has UV divergences (for example, in the calculation of an electron's self-energy) and therefore *requires* regularization.\n\n    *   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** This is the classical theory of electricity and magnetism (Maxwell's equations). While it is not a quantum theory and doesn't have the loop divergences of QFT, it has its own high-energy/short-distance problem. If you model an electron as a true mathematical point, its self-energy (the energy of its own electric field) becomes infinite. This indicates a breakdown of the theory at very short distances. While the problem is different from that in QFT, it's still a divergence at high energy/short distance that requires some form of \"regularization\" (e.g., assuming the particle has a finite, non-zero size) to resolve, which introduces other inconsistencies.\n\n    *   **D) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is to resolve the problems of infinities that arise in QFT, particularly when trying to include gravity. Unlike point particles in QFT, the fundamental objects in string theory are one-dimensional \"strings.\" Their interactions are \"smeared out\" over a region of spacetime, rather than occurring at a single point. This smearing effect naturally smooths out the short-distance behavior that leads to UV divergences in QFT. Consequently, superstring theory is believed to be \"UV finite,\" meaning its calculations do not produce these high-energy infinities. It therefore does not require the artificial procedure of regularization.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Quantum Chromodynamics and Quantum Electrodynamics are both quantum field theories that inherently require regularization. Classical Electrodynamics has its own short-distance infinity problem. Superstring Theory, by its fundamental nature, is constructed to be free of high-energy (UV) divergences and thus is the theory that never requires regularization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
