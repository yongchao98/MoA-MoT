    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of an O-H bond involved in strong hydrogen bonding. The \"very broad\" nature, spanning a wide range that includes 3000 cm⁻¹, is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically found around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This piece of data strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene group, corroborating the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a common, stable fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxylic acid functional group itself, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass of Carbon (C) ≈ 12 amu\n        *   Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 amu\n        *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1 amu\n        *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 + (2 * 16) + 1 = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This m/z = 45 peak is a classic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids, representing the loss of the carboxyl group as a cation. This provides very strong evidence for the presence of a -COOH group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings and Determine Structural Requirements:**\n    *   From the combined data, we can conclude that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   This means the molecule must contain:\n        1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which includes **two oxygen atoms** and a **C=O double bond**.\n        2.  An alkene group, which includes a **C=C double bond**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (or number of double bond equivalences) tells us the total number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for 1 DBE.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the alkene group accounts for another 1 DBE.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total DBE of **2**.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    *   First, we know the compound must be a carboxylic acid, so it needs **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options B (C₆H₁₀O) and C (C₆H₁₂O), leaving only A (C₆H₁₀O₂) and D (C₆H₁₂O₂).\n    *   Now, let's calculate the DBE for the remaining options using the formula: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dbe(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the degree of unsaturation for a given chemical formula C_c H_h O_o.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    atoms = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in parts}\n    \n    c = atoms.get('C', 0)\n    h = atoms.get('H', 0)\n    \n    dbe = c - (h / 2) + 1\n    return int(dbe)\n\nformula_A = \"C6H10O2\"\nformula_D = \"C6H12O2\"\n\ndbe_A = calculate_dbe(formula_A)\ndbe_D = calculate_dbe(formula_D)\n\nprint(f\"Formula A ({formula_A}): DBE = {dbe_A}\")\nprint(f\"Formula D ({formula_D}): DBE = {dbe_D}\")\n```\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Our analysis of the spectra requires the molecule to have a DBE of 2 (one for the C=O and one for the C=C). Only the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** has a DBE of 2. The formula C₆H₁₂O₂ only has a DBE of 1, which would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but this contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond from FTIR and NMR.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound must be C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound has been identified.\n\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a **carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a **carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a C=C (alkene) double bond.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of vinyl-hydrogens explicitly confirms the presence of an **alkene** functional group.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic signature for the [COOH]⁺ fragment, providing strong evidence for a **carboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Structural Conclusion & Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   The evidence collectively points to an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This structure must contain two oxygen atoms (in the -COOH group), which eliminates options B (C₆H₁₀O) and C (C₆H₁₂O).\n    *   The molecule has at least two degrees of unsaturation: one from the C=O bond in the acid and one from the C=C bond of the alkene. Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a DBE of 2.\n    *   The calculation performed confirms:\n        *   **C₆H₁₀O₂** has a DBE of **2**. (DBE = 6 - 10/2 + 1 = 2)\n        *   **C₆H₁₂O₂** has a DBE of **1**. (DBE = 6 - 12/2 + 1 = 1)\n\nOnly the formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is consistent with all the spectral data, as it is the only option with two oxygen atoms and the required two degrees of unsaturation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
