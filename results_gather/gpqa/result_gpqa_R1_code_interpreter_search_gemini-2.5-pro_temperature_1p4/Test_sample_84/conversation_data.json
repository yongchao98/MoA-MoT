    "This problem requires us to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets orbiting the same star.\n\n### **1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nwhere:\n-   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n-   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n-   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n-   `A` is the planet's bond albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both. The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = ((1 / a1) / (1 / a2))^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets' orbits.\n\n### **2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observables**\n\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift (Δλ) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (the semi-amplitude, K) by the formula:\n\nK = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`), the star's mass (`M_star`), and the semi-major axis (`a`) by:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nK ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))\n\nThis formula assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star) and that the system is viewed edge-on (inclination i = 90°), which is a reasonable assumption since the planets were also detected by the transit method.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\nK² = M_p² * G / (a * M_star)\na = G * M_p² / (K² * M_star)\n\n### **3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n\na2 / a1 = [G * M_p2² / (K₂² * M_star)] / [G * M_p1² / (K₁² * M_star)]\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes `K₁ / K₂` is directly proportional to the ratio of their Doppler shifts `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\n### **4. Plugging in the Values**\n\nWe are given the following information:\n-   `M_p1` = 7 Earth masses\n-   `M_p2` = 5 Earth masses\n-   `Δλ₁` = 0.03 Å\n-   `Δλ₂` = 0.04 Å\n\nLet's calculate the ratios:\n-   `M_p2 / M_p1` = 5 / 7\n-   `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂` = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, we can find `a2 / a1`:\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)² = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784\n\n### **5. Final Calculation of Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = (225 / 784)^(1/2)\n\nTo simplify the calculation:\n-   sqrt(225) = 15\n-   sqrt(784) = 28\n\nSo, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nNow, we convert this fraction to a decimal.\n```python\n# Calculate the final ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n# Ratio = sqrt(a2/a1)\n# a2/a1 = (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\n# K1/K2 = d_lambda1 / d_lambda2\n\nmp1 = 7  # Earth masses\nmp2 = 5  # Earth masses\ndl1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\ndl2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# Ratio of planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = mp2 / mp1\n\n# Ratio of radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 / K2), which is equal to the ratio of Doppler shifts\ndoppler_ratio = dl1 / dl2\n\n# Ratio of semi-major axes (a2 / a1)\na_ratio = (mass_ratio**2) * (doppler_ratio**2)\n\n# Ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2)\ntemp_ratio = a_ratio**0.5\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are identical for both and cancel out. The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (`A1` = `A2`), so the `(1 - A)` terms also cancel out. The factor of 2 in the denominator also cancels. This simplifies the ratio to:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [(1/a1)^(1/2)] / [(1/a2)^(1/2)] = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits (a2 / a1).\n\n**2. Relate Observables to the Semi-Major Axis**\n\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem), the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`), the star's mass (`M_star`), and the semi-major axis (`a`) by the following approximation (assuming M_p << M_star):\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\nK² ≈ M_p² * G / (a * M_star)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio `a2 / a1`:\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (K₂² * M_star)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (K₁² * M_star)]\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` are the same for both systems and cancel out:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**3. Determine the Ratio of Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₁ / K₂) **\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` it induces, according to the Doppler effect formula: K = c * (Δλ / λ₀), where `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**4. Combine and Calculate**\n\nSubstitute this result back into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (0.03 / 0.04)²\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, use the relationship derived in step 1:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (225 / 784)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nMp1 = 7  # Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nMp2 = 5  # Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\nd_lambda1 = 0.03  # Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\nd_lambda2 = 0.04  # Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is equal to sqrt(a2 / a1).\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes a2 / a1 is given by (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2.\n# The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts d_lambda1 / d_lambda2.\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1)\nratio_a2_a1 = (Mp2 / Mp1)**2 * (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)**2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\nratio_Teq = math.sqrt(ratio_a2_a1)\n\nprint(ratio_Teq)\n```\nThe python code execution confirmed the result is ~0.5357. Comparing this to the given options, the closest choice is 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires us to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets.\n\n**1. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nwhere `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `a` is the orbital semi-major axis, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio for Planet1 and Planet2, we have:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (`A1` = `A2`). Therefore, most terms cancel out, leaving:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / a1)^(1/2) / (1 / a2)^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\n\nOur goal is now to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n**2. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit causing a radial velocity (RV) variation in its star, the RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\nK ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))\n(Assuming the planet's mass `M_p` is much less than the star's mass `M_star`).\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\nK² ≈ M_p² * G / (a * M_star)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (K₂² * M_star)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (K₁² * M_star)]\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**3. Relate RV Amplitude to Doppler Shift**\n\nThe Doppler shift `Δλ` is directly proportional to the radial velocity `v`, and therefore the RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift.\nK = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\nSo, the ratio of the amplitudes `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio of their observed maximum Doppler shifts `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**4. Combine and Calculate**\n\nSubstitute the Doppler shift ratio into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, we can substitute this entire expression back into our temperature ratio formula from Step 1:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [ (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]^(1/2)\n\nThe square root cancels the squares:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n**5. Plug in the Values**\n\nWe are given:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n15 ÷ 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53. The information about the star's mass, radius, temperature, and the planets' radii is extraneous and not needed for the final ratio calculation.\n\nThe provided code output `0.5357142857142857` confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
