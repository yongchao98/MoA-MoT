    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reagents.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the addition of a cyanide group (-CN) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) across the carbonyl group (C=O) of a ketone (butan-2-one). This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   The cyanide ion (CN⁻), provided by sodium cyanide (NaCN), is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This nucleophilic attack breaks the C=O pi bond, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This negatively charged alkoxide ion is a base and needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, the cyanohydrin, which has a neutral hydroxyl group (-OH).\n3.  **Determine the role of reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   Let's look at the options for A: H3O⁺ and NaHSO3.\n    *   `NaHSO3` (sodium bisulfite) is a reagent used to form crystalline bisulfite addition products with aldehydes and some ketones, primarily for purification. It is not a proton source for this reaction.\n    *   `H3O⁺` (hydronium ion, representing an acidic aqueous solution like HCl(aq) or H2SO4(aq)) is a strong proton source. In the context of cyanohydrin formation, the reaction can be performed by adding NaCN and then quenching the reaction with an acid (an acid workup) to protonate the intermediate. Thus, H3O⁺ is a suitable reagent for step A.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 1:** A = H3O⁺\n\n---\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is the **hydrolysis of a nitrile**. The presence of H₂O in the reactants list further confirms this.\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base, typically with heating.\n    *   The reaction proceeds in two main stages: first, hydrolysis of the nitrile to an amide, and second, further hydrolysis of the amide to a carboxylic acid and ammonia (or ammonium ion if under acidic conditions).\n3.  **Determine the role of reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   Let's look at the options for B: HCl and CH3COOH.\n    *   `CH3COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it can protonate the nitrile, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid in a reasonable timeframe.\n    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid. Strong acids are the standard reagents used for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction is typically performed by refluxing the nitrile in aqueous HCl or H2SO4.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 2:** B = HCl\n\n---\n\n**Final Synthesis:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, reagent **A** must be a proton source to complete the cyanohydrin formation. **H3O⁺** is the appropriate choice.\n*   For the second reaction, reagent **B** must be a catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis. The strong acid **HCl** is the correct choice over the weak acid CH3COOH.\n\nCombining these findings, we have A = H3O⁺ and B = HCl. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
