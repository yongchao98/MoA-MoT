    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nIron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, is a sparingly soluble solid. To dissolve it, we need to add an acid. A strong monobasic acid (let's denote it as HA) provides H⁺ ions. These H⁺ ions react with the hydroxide ions (OH⁻) produced by the dissolution of Fe(OH)₃, shifting the equilibrium towards the dissolved state.\n\nThe dissolution equilibrium is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n\nThe neutralization reaction with the acid is:\nH⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\n\nThe overall net ionic equation for dissolving Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n### **2. Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ that we need to dissolve.\n- Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g\n- Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃:\n  - Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n  - O: 15.999 g/mol\n  - H: 1.008 g/mol\n  - Molar Mass = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\n- Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass\n  - Moles = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.00093575 mol\n\n### **3. Determine the Required Amount of Acid**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ ions added from the acid serves two purposes:\n1.  **Reaction:** To react stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Excess:** To remain in the solution to keep it acidic enough to prevent Fe(OH)₃ from re-precipitating. This excess amount of H⁺ determines the final pH of the solution.\n\nTotal Moles of H⁺ = Moles for Reaction + Moles in Excess\n\n### **4. Analyze the Options**\n\nThis problem has two unknowns (the volume of acid and the final pH) and is best solved by checking which of the provided options is self-consistent. We will test each option to see if the given pH and volume values are compatible.\n\nLet's create a general formula:\n- `V_acid` = Volume of acid in L\n- `C_acid` = 0.1 M\n- `V_total` = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n- Moles of H⁺ added = `V_acid * C_acid` = `V_acid * 0.1`\n\n- **Moles for Reaction (`n_react`)**: From the stoichiometry (1 mole Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles H⁺):\n  `n_react` = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * 0.00093575 mol = 0.00280725 mol\n\n- **Moles in Excess (`n_excess`)**: This is the amount of H⁺ in the final 100 cm³ solution, which determines its pH.\n  `[H⁺]_final = 10**(-pH)`\n  `n_excess = [H⁺]_final * V_total = 10**(-pH) * 0.1`\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ must balance:\n`V_acid * 0.1 = n_react + n_excess`\n`V_acid = (n_react + n_excess) / 0.1`\n`V_acid (in L) = (0.00280725 + 10**(-pH) * 0.1) / 0.1`\n\nLet's test the options with this formula. It is more convenient to work with volume in cm³ (V_cm³ = V_acid * 1000).\n`V_cm³ = 1000 * [ (0.00280725 + 10**(-pH) * 0.1) / 0.1 ]`\n`V_cm³ = 10 * (0.00280725 + 10**(-pH) * 0.1)`\n\n**Let's run the calculation with a Python script to check all options efficiently.**\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Initial Data ---\nmass_FeOH3 = 0.1  # g\ntotal_volume_L = 0.1  # 100 cm3 = 0.1 L\nacid_conc = 0.1  # M\n\n# --- Molar Mass ---\n# Using precise molar masses\nmolar_mass_FeOH3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) # g/mol\n\n# Moles of Fe(OH)3 to dissolve\nmoles_FeOH3 = mass_FeOH3 / molar_mass_FeOH3\n\n# Moles of H+ required for the stoichiometric reaction\nmoles_H_react = 3 * moles_FeOH3\n\n# --- Test the given options ---\noptions = {\n    'A': {'pH': 3.16, 'V_cm3': 32.14},\n    'B': {'pH': 2.04, 'V_cm3': 28.05},\n    'C': {'pH': 2.69, 'V_cm3': 30.09},\n    'D': {'pH': 4.94, 'V_cm3': 20.40}\n}\n\nprint(f\"Moles of Fe(OH)3 = {moles_FeOH3:.6f}\")\nprint(f\"Stoichiometric moles of H+ = {moles_H_react:.6f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\nfor key, values in options.items():\n    pH = values['pH']\n    \n    # Calculate moles of excess H+ based on the option's pH\n    conc_H_excess = 10**(-pH)\n    moles_H_excess = conc_H_excess * total_volume_L\n    \n    # Calculate total moles of H+ that would be needed\n    total_moles_H = moles_H_react + moles_H_excess\n    \n    # Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid required to provide these moles\n    required_volume_L = total_moles_H / acid_conc\n    required_volume_cm3 = required_volume_L * 1000\n    \n    print(f\"Testing Option {key}:\")\n    print(f\"  Given pH = {pH}, Given Volume = {values['V_cm3']:.2f} cm3\")\n    print(f\"  Calculated Required Volume = {required_volume_cm3:.2f} cm3\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n```\n\n### **5. Interpretation of Results**\n\nThe output of the code will show the volume of acid calculated based on the pH of each option. We compare this calculated volume to the volume given in the option.\n\n- **Option A (pH 3.16):** Calculated Volume ≈ 28.77 cm³ vs. Given Volume = 32.14 cm³ (Mismatch)\n- **Option B (pH 2.04):** Calculated Volume ≈ 37.19 cm³ vs. Given Volume = 28.05 cm³ (Mismatch)\n- **Option C (pH 2.69):** Calculated Volume ≈ 30.11 cm³ vs. Given Volume = 30.09 cm³ (**Excellent Match**)\n- **Option D (pH 4.94):** Calculated Volume ≈ 28.08 cm³ vs. Given Volume = 20.40 cm³ (Mismatch)\n\nThe calculated volume for Option C (30.11 cm³) is almost identical to the given volume (30.09 cm³). The minor difference is due to rounding in the problem's constants or values. This confirms that Option C provides a self-consistent pair of pH and volume values according to the chemistry of the dissolution.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The code execution confirms the reasoning. The script calculates the required volume of acid based on the pH given in each option and compares it to the volume provided in that same option.\n\n-   **For Option A (pH 3.16):** The calculated volume (28.76 cm³) does not match the given volume (32.14 cm³).\n-   **For Option B (pH 2.04):** The calculated volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the given volume (28.05 cm³).\n-   **For Option C (pH 2.69):** The calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is an excellent match for the given volume (30.09 cm³). The slight difference is negligible and likely due to rounding in the problem statement's values.\n-   **For Option D (pH 4.94):** The calculated volume (28.08 cm³) does not match the given volume (20.40 cm³).\n\nThe only self-consistent option is C, where the amount of acid added is sufficient to both dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the specified final pH.\n\n<<<C>>>"
