    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks how the number of stars per unit range of distance, which can be written as `dN/dr`, depends on the distance `r`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:** We are told that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". In physics and astronomy, this phrasing typically refers to the number density or differential count. Therefore, we can express this as:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    where `N` is the number of stars and `plx` is the parallax.\n\n3.  **Recall the Fundamental Relationship:** Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely related. The definition of parallax is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Connect the Given and Target Quantities:** We need to find `dN/dr` starting from `dN/d(plx)`. We can use the chain rule for derivatives to relate these two quantities:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Connecting Derivative:** We need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance, `d(plx)/dr`.\n    Since `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we can differentiate it:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:** Now we substitute the known relationships into the chain rule equation. Since we are interested in how the number count (a positive quantity) scales, we can ignore the negative sign which just indicates the inverse relationship between `r` and `plx`. We use the magnitude of the derivative:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n    \n    The relationship between the number densities is `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`.\n    \n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (r):** The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. To get the final dependency on `r`, we must substitute `plx = 1/r` into the equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (r⁻²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to the cube of the distance (`r³`). Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~ r²\n    B) ~ r⁵\n    C) ~ r³\n    D) ~ r⁴\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
