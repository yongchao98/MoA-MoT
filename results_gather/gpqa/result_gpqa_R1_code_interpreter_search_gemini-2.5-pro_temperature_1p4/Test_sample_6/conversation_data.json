    "Answering this question requires applying the principles of special relativity to the particle physics process of pair production. The specific process is the annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) with a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to create an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$). The reaction is:\n\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$\n\nHere is the reasoning process to determine the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Four-Momentum**: In any relativistic interaction, the total four-momentum is conserved. The four-momentum is a vector `p = (E/c, **p**)` where E is energy and **p** is the three-dimensional momentum. For simplicity in calculations, we often use units where the speed of light `c = 1`. In these units, the four-momentum is `p = (E, **p**)`.\n\n2.  **Lorentz Invariance**: The square of the total four-momentum (the scalar product of the four-momentum with itself) is a Lorentz invariant quantity. This means it has the same value in all inertial reference frames. We can use this property by calculating the square of the total four-momentum in two different convenient frames: the laboratory frame (where the CMB is nearly at rest) and the center-of-mass frame.\n\n3.  **Threshold Energy Condition**: The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. This happens when the final products (the electron and positron) are created at rest in the center-of-mass (CM) frame.\n\n4.  **Calculation in the Center-of-Mass (CM) Frame**:\n    *   Let `m_e` be the rest mass of the electron (which is the same as the positron). At the threshold, the electron and positron are created at rest in the CM frame.\n    *   The total energy in the CM frame is simply the sum of the rest mass energies of the created particles: `E_{cm} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2`.\n    *   The total momentum in the CM frame is zero by definition.\n    *   The square of the total four-momentum in the CM frame is `(p_{total, cm})^2 = (E_{cm})^2 - (|**p**|_{cm})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 - 0^2 = 4m_e^2 c^4`.\n\n5.  **Calculation in the Laboratory Frame**:\n    *   Let the high-energy gamma-ray have energy `E_γ` and the CMB photon have energy `E_{CMB}`.\n    *   For a photon, the magnitude of its momentum is `p = E/c`.\n    *   The total four-momentum before the collision is the sum of the four-momenta of the two photons: `p_{total, lab} = p_γ + p_{CMB}`.\n    *   The square of the total four-momentum is `(p_{total, lab})^2 = (p_γ + p_{CMB})^2 = p_γ^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2(p_γ \\cdot p_{CMB})`.\n    *   For any photon, the square of its own four-momentum is zero (`p^2 = E^2 - (pc)^2 = E^2 - ( (E/c)c )^2 = 0`). So, `p_γ^2 = 0` and `p_{CMB}^2 = 0`.\n    *   The dot product of the two four-momenta is `p_γ \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_γ E_{CMB} - c^2 (**p**_γ \\cdot **p**_{CMB}) = E_γ E_{CMB} - E_γ E_{CMB} \\cos(\\theta)`, where `θ` is the angle between the paths of the two photons.\n    *   Therefore, `(p_{total, lab})^2 = 2E_γ E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos(\\theta))`.\n\n6.  **Equating the Invariants and Solving for Threshold Energy**:\n    *   Since the square of the four-momentum is invariant, we can equate the expressions from the two frames:\n        `4m_e^2 c^4 = 2E_γ E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos(\\theta))`\n    *   We are looking for the minimum (threshold) energy `E_γ`. This minimum will occur when the term `(1 - \\cos(\\theta))` is at its maximum. The maximum value is 2, which happens when `θ = π` (180 degrees), corresponding to a head-on collision.\n    *   Substituting `1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 2`:\n        `4m_e^2 c^4 = 2E_γ E_{CMB} (2)`\n        `4m_e^2 c^4 = 4E_γ E_{CMB}`\n    *   Solving for the threshold energy `E_γ`:\n        `E_γ = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_{CMB}`\n\n7.  **Plugging in the Values**:\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron is `m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 \\times 10^6 eV`.\n    *   The average energy of a CMB photon is given as `E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} eV`.\n\n    Now, we calculate `E_γ`:\n    `E_γ = (0.511 \\times 10^6 eV)^2 / (10^{-3} eV)`\n    `E_γ = (0.2611 \\times 10^{12} eV^2) / (10^{-3} eV)`\n    `E_γ = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} eV`\n    `E_γ = 2.611 \\times 10^{14} eV`\n\n8.  **Converting to Giga-electron-volts (GeV)**:\n    *   We know that `1 GeV = 10^9 eV`.\n    *   `E_γ = (2.611 \\times 10^{14} eV) / (10^9 eV/GeV) = 2.611 \\times 10^5 GeV`\n\nThis value, approximately `2.6 \\times 10^5` GeV, represents the threshold energy for a gamma-ray to have its lifetime significantly limited by pair production with CMB photons.

    "This problem requires us to find the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) for it to undergo pair production when colliding with a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background ($\\gamma_{CMB}$). The reaction is:\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$\n\nTo solve this, we can use the principle of Lorentz invariance of the total four-momentum squared ($P^2$). The four-momentum is a vector in spacetime, defined as $P = (E/c, \\mathbf{p})$, where E is the energy and $\\mathbf{p}$ is the three-momentum. The square of the four-momentum is $P^2 = (E/c)^2 - |\\mathbf{p}|^2$. This quantity is the same in all inertial reference frames. We will work in natural units where the speed of light $c=1$.\n\n**1. In the Center-of-Mass (CM) Frame:**\nThe threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. At this threshold, the electron ($e^-$) and positron ($e^+$) are created at rest in the center-of-mass frame.\n*   The energy of the electron is its rest mass energy, $m_e$.\n*   The energy of the positron is also its rest mass energy, $m_e$.\n*   The total energy in the CM frame is $E_{cm} = m_e + m_e = 2m_e$.\n*   Since the particles are at rest, the total momentum in the CM frame is $\\mathbf{p}_{cm} = 0$.\n*   The square of the total four-momentum in the CM frame is:\n    $P^2 = (E_{cm})^2 - |\\mathbf{p}_{cm}|^2 = (2m_e)^2 - 0^2 = 4m_e^2$.\n\n**2. In the Laboratory Frame:**\nIn the lab frame, we have a high-energy gamma-ray with energy $E_\\gamma$ and a CMB photon with energy $E_{CMB}$.\n*   The four-momentum of the high-energy gamma-ray is $P_\\gamma = (E_\\gamma, \\mathbf{p}_\\gamma)$, where $|\\mathbf{p}_\\gamma| = E_\\gamma$.\n*   The four-momentum of the CMB photon is $P_{CMB} = (E_{CMB}, \\mathbf{p}_{CMB})$, where $|\\mathbf{p}_{CMB}| = E_{CMB}$.\n*   The total four-momentum before the collision is $P_{total} = P_\\gamma + P_{CMB}$.\n*   The square of the total four-momentum is:\n    $P^2 = (P_\\gamma + P_{CMB})^2 = P_\\gamma^2 + P_{CMB}^2 + 2(P_\\gamma \\cdot P_{CMB})$.\n*   For any photon, its four-momentum squared is zero ($P^2 = E^2 - |\\mathbf{p}|^2 = E^2 - E^2 = 0$). So, $P_\\gamma^2 = 0$ and $P_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\n*   The dot product is $P_\\gamma \\cdot P_{CMB} = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - \\mathbf{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\mathbf{p}_{CMB} = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - |\\mathbf{p}_\\gamma||\\mathbf{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta = E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two photons.\n*   So, the square of the total four-momentum in the lab frame is:\n    $P^2 = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta)$.\n\n**3. Equating and Solving for Threshold Energy:**\nBy Lorentz invariance, the value of $P^2$ must be the same in both frames:\n$4m_e^2 = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta)$\n\nWe want to find the minimum (threshold) energy $E_\\gamma$ for the reaction to occur. To minimize $E_\\gamma$, the term $(1-\\cos\\theta)$ must be maximized. This occurs for a head-on collision, where $\\theta = \\pi$ (or 180°), and $\\cos\\theta = -1$. In this case, $(1-\\cos\\theta) = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\nSubstituting this value:\n$4m_e^2 = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(2)$\n$4m_e^2 = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{m_e^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n**4.

    "The calculation has been performed and verified.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n1.  The problem involves a relativistic particle collision, $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$. The threshold energy for this reaction is determined by conserving the four-momentum.\n2.  The square of the total four-momentum is a Lorentz invariant quantity, meaning it is the same in all inertial reference frames. We calculate this quantity in the center-of-mass (CM) frame and the laboratory frame and set them equal.\n3.  In the CM frame, at the threshold, the electron and positron are created at rest. The total energy is $E_{cm} = 2m_e c^2$ and the total momentum is zero. The invariant square of the four-momentum is $(P_{total})^2 = (E_{cm})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2$.\n4.  In the lab frame, the threshold energy $E_\\gamma$ is minimized when the collision with the CMB photon (energy $E_{CMB}$) is head-on. In this case, the invariant square of the four-momentum is $(P_{total})^2 = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$.\n5.  Equating the two expressions gives $(2m_e c^2)^2 = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$, which simplifies to the threshold energy formula: $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$.\n6.  Plugging in the values:\n    *   Electron rest mass energy, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Average CMB photon energy, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n    \n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.6 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n7.  Converting to GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$):\n    $E_\\gamma = 2.6 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} / (10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}) = 2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.
