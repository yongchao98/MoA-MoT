    "This problem requires understanding the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, when reacting with a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. The stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product, which allows us to determine the required configuration of the starting materials.\n\n### Analysis of the Molecules\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The options provided are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's determine its structure.\n    *   The parent chain is pentanoic acid, `HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   `3-ethyl`: An ethyl group is at position 3. `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   `5-isobutoxy-5-oxo`: This describes a substituent at position 5. `oxo` means `C=O`, and `isobutoxy` means `-O-iBu`. Together, `C(=O)O-iBu`, this is an isobutyl ester group. This group replaces the `CH3` at the end of the chain.\n    *   Therefore, the structure is `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`. This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n    *   This molecule has a single chiral center at carbon-3, where the ethyl group is attached. The starting materials A and B are the (R) or (S) enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Product:** The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center is at position 4. This chiral center corresponds to the chiral center at position 3 of the open-chain precursor. The reactions do not affect this chiral center, so its configuration (R or S) is retained from the starting material.\n\n### Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-lactone\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that can reduce both esters and carboxylic acids. However, it reduces esters more readily than carboxylic acids. Therefore, under controlled conditions, LiBH4 can selectively reduce the ester group in the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n2.  **Reaction Pathway:**\n    *   Starting material A (`HOOC-CH2-CH(A)(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`) is treated with LiBH4.\n    *   The ester group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`) is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains largely unchanged.\n    *   The intermediate formed is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH(A)(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`.\n    *   The acid workup (H+) promotes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the six-membered lactone product.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction at C5, cyclization between C1 and C5-OH) do not involve the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To obtain the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material A must have the `(R)` configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-lactone\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH3) is a highly chemoselective reducing agent. It is particularly known for reducing carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n2.  **Reaction Pathway:**\n    *   Starting material B (`HOOC-CH2-CH(B)(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`) is treated with BH3.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    *   The ester group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`) remains unchanged.\n    *   The intermediate formed is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: `HOCH2-CH2-CH(B)(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`.\n    *   The acid workup (H+) promotes intramolecular transesterification, where the hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the transformations occur at the functional groups and do not affect the chiral center at C3. To obtain the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material B must have the `(S)` configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the selective nature of the reducing agents:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
