    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and an understanding of how different types of HPLC separate stereoisomers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. Since the substituent on C4 is a propyl group and the substituent on C5 is also a propyl group, the alkene is symmetrically substituted.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation. The addition of the oxygen atom to the double bond is a **syn-addition**, meaning it adds to the same face of the alkene. For a trans-alkene, syn-epoxidation produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides. In this case, it forms a 1:1 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent opens the epoxide ring via an **anti-addition** mechanism (an Sₙ2-like attack by water on the protonated epoxide).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** The rule for anti-addition to alkenes is:\n    *   (E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound (if symmetrically substituted)\n    *   (Z)-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture\n    Since we start with (E)-oct-4-ene (a symmetric trans-alkene), the final product of Reaction 1 is the single, achiral, meso compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol** ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, also symmetrically substituted.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** Applying the same rule for anti-addition:\n    *   (Z)-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture\n    Since we start with (Z)-oct-4-ene, the final product of Reaction 2 is a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mixture) of the two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol) will not be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will have a different retention time and elute as a **separate peak**.\n    *   **Result:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column can distinguish between the two enantiomers because they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase. Thus, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol will give one peak, and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol will give a second, separate peak.\n    *   The meso compound (a diastereomer to the others) will also be separated and elute as its own distinct peak.\n    *   **Result:** The chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
