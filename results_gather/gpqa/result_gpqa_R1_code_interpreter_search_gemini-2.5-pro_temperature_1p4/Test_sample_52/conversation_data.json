    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data to Determine the Number of Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    The problem provides a detailed description of the 1H NMR spectrum. We can count the total number of hydrogen atoms by summing up the hydrogens from each type of signal.\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (like benzene) has the formula C6H4 when substituted twice. This accounts for **4 hydrogens**. The two signals suggest a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which gives this number of protons and signals.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** These signals correspond to hydrogens attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). This accounts for **2 hydrogens**. The splitting pattern (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) suggests a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3, which is consistent with this proton count.\n    *   **–CH3 groups (2 signals):** There are two distinct methyl groups. Each methyl group (–CH3) has 3 hydrogens. Therefore, two methyl groups account for 2 * 3 = **6 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Total Hydrogens:** Summing these up: 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = **12 hydrogens**.\n\n2.  **Narrow Down the Options:**\n    The four possible chemical formulas are:\n    A) C11H12O2\n    B) C12H12O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C12H14O2\n\n    Based on our calculation, the molecule must contain 12 hydrogen atoms. This eliminates options C and D, which have 14 hydrogens. We are left with A (C11H12O2) and B (C12H12O2).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Functional Groups to Determine the Number of Carbon Atoms:**\n    Let's identify the carbon-containing fragments based on the spectroscopic data.\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a C6H4 unit, contributing **6 carbons**.\n    *   **FTIR (ester group) and NMR (2 CH3 signals):** The FTIR shows an ester (-COO-). The NMR shows two methyl signals. One methyl group is part of the propenyl group (see next point). The other must be part of the ester, suggesting either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OCOCH3). In either case, the ester functional group itself contains one carbonyl carbon (-C=O), and the second methyl signal provides another carbon.\n    *   **Vinyl and Methyl groups:** The vinyl signals (-CH=CH-) and one of the methyl signals are best explained by a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). This substituent contributes **3 carbons**.\n    *   **Second Methyl group:** The second CH3 signal accounts for **1 carbon**.\n    *   **Ester Carbonyl:** The ester group (-COO-) contains a carbonyl carbon, which accounts for **1 carbon**.\n\n    Now, let's assemble these carbons to find the total count:\n    *   Total Carbons = 6 (from aromatic ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 1 (from the second methyl group) + 1 (from the ester carbonyl) = **11 carbons**.\n\n    Let's verify this by building a plausible molecule. Let's assume the structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate:\n    *   Benzene ring: C6\n    *   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): C3\n    *   Methyl ester group (-COOCH3): C2 (one for the C=O, one for the O-CH3)\n    *   Total Carbons = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 carbons. This is consistent.\n    *   This gives a formula of **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for Confirmation:**\n    The DBE (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) helps to check if the proposed formula is consistent with the structural features.\n    *   Formula: C11H12O2\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Let's check the structural features:\n        *   Aromatic ring = 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DBE\n        *   Vinyl group (C=C) = 1 DBE\n        *   Ester group (C=O) = 1 DBE\n        *   Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   The calculated DBE for the formula C11H12O2 perfectly matches the DBE of the structure derived from the spectroscopic data. The molecule is also consistent with the \"no -CH2 groups\" constraint.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The analysis of the number of hydrogens (12) and the number of carbons (11) both point to the chemical formula C11H12O2. This formula is fully consistent with all the information provided (FTIR, 1H NMR details, and DBE).\n\n<<<A>>>"
