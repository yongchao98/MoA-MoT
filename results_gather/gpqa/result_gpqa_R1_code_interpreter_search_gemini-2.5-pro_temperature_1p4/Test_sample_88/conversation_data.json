    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Product 1\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). Adamantane has a rigid tricyclic cage structure. The 1 and 3 positions are bridgehead carbons.\n2.  **Reagents:** Excess KOH (a strong base) at high temperature (240°C).\n3.  **Reaction Analysis:** Simple elimination (E2) or substitution (SN2) is difficult at bridgehead carbons. However, under these harsh conditions, rearrangement reactions are common for adamantane derivatives. A known reaction for 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with base at high temperatures is a complex rearrangement and fragmentation.\n4.  **Spectral Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR: 1720 cm⁻¹**: This is a characteristic absorption for a C=O (carbonyl) group, specifically a saturated ketone in a six-membered ring. An α,β-unsaturated ketone would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Total integration is 2H + 10H + 2H = 14H. This means the product has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4. A ketone (C=O) accounts for one degree of unsaturation. The remaining IHD of 3 corresponds to a tricyclic system (like adamantane) or a bicyclic system with a double bond.\n    *   The signal at **4.79 ppm (2H)** is highly diagnostic. This chemical shift is too high for any proton in a simple saturated adamantane-based ketone (like adamantan-2-one). It is characteristic of vinylic protons, specifically an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n5.  **Structure Deduction for Product 1:** We need a structure with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O, containing a non-conjugated ketone and a =CH₂ group. The IHD of 4 requires a bicyclic core (IHD=2), a C=O (IHD=1), and a C=C (IHD=1). The most plausible structure that can be formed from an adamantane rearrangement and fits the data is **3-methylidene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-one**.\n    *   **Formula:** The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core with a ketone at C9 is C₉H₁₄O. Replacing two hydrogens at C3 with a =CH₂ group gives C₁₀H₁₄O. This fits.\n    *   **IR:** The ketone at the C9 bridge is in two six-membered rings and is known to absorb near 1720 cm⁻¹. This fits.\n    *   **NMR:** The two protons of the exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) account for the signal at 4.79 ppm. This fits perfectly. The remaining 12 protons on the bicyclic frame account for the other signals.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Product 2\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (3-methylidene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**. This reaction specifically reduces aldehydes and ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n3.  **Product 2 Structure:** The ketone at C9 is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-OH). The exocyclic double bond at C3 remains untouched.\n4.  Therefore, Product 2 is **3-methylidene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Product 3\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (3-methylidene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is an **ozonolysis** with a reductive workup (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves C=C double bonds and replaces them with carbonyl groups. A reductive workup ensures that aldehydes (if formed) are not oxidized to carboxylic acids.\n3.  **Product 3 Structure:** The C=CH₂ double bond at C3 is cleaved. The terminal =CH₂ carbon becomes formaldehyde (a side product). The C3 carbon of the bicyclic ring becomes a ketone (C=O). The alcohol group at C9 is unaffected.\n4.  Therefore, Product 3 is **9-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR of Product 3\n\n1.  **Structure of Product 3:** 9-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one. This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3, the C=O group, C9, the CH-OH group, and C7.\n2.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** We need to find the proton with the highest chemical shift (excluding the exchangeable O-H proton).\n    *   Protons alpha to the ketone (at C2 and C4) are deshielded (~2.2-2.7 ppm).\n    *   The proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (H9) is significantly deshielded (~3.5-4.5 ppm).\n    *   Therefore, **H9 is the most deshielded proton.**\n3.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H9:** We must identify the neighboring protons to which H9 couples.\n    *   **Vicinal Coupling (3-bond):** H9 is on carbon C9. The adjacent carbons are the two bridgeheads, C1 and C5. H9 couples to the protons H1 and H5. Due to the molecule's symmetry, H1 and H5 are chemically equivalent. Coupling to two equivalent protons gives a **triplet** (n+1 rule, n=2). Let's call the coupling constant J_vic.\n    *   **Long-Range Coupling (4-bond):** In rigid bicyclic systems like this, long-range \"W-coupling\" is common and often resolved. H9 is in a perfect position for W-coupling with the equatorial protons on C2, C4, C6, and C8.\n        *   Due to the plane of symmetry, H2eq is equivalent to H4eq. H9 will couple to this pair of protons, which would split the signal into a second **triplet**. Let's call this coupling constant J_W1.\n        *   Similarly, H6eq is equivalent to H8eq. H9 could also couple to this pair, giving a third triplet. However, the ketone at C3 makes the environment of the C2/C4 protons different from the C6/C8 protons. Thus, the coupling constants would be different (J_W1 ≠ J_W2). It's also likely that one of these long-range couplings is much smaller than the other.\n    *   **Combining Couplings:** The primary coupling is the vicinal one to H1/H5, giving a triplet. It is very likely that the larger of the two long-range couplings (to H2eq/H4eq) is also resolved. Since the vicinal coupling constant (J_vic) and the long-range coupling constant (J_W1) will be different, the overall pattern will be a multiplet arising from splitting by two *different* pairs of equivalent protons.\n    *   This pattern is described as a **triplet of triplets**. The main triplet comes from the larger vicinal coupling to H1/H5, and each line of that triplet is further split into a smaller triplet by the long-range W-coupling to H2eq/H4eq.\n\nBased on this analysis, the coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton (H9) is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<B>>>"
