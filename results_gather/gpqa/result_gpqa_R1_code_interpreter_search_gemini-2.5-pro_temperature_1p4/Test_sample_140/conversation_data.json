    "This problem requires understanding the benzyne mechanism for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, as well as the kinetic isotope effect (KIE).\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   Substrate: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D) at position C2. All other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   Reagent/Solvent: Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the amide ion, NH₂⁻, is the active species) and liquid ammonia serves as the solvent. These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    The strong base, NH₂⁻, abstracts a \"proton\" from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions:\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    Because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, it is broken more easily and more quickly. This is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE). Consequently, two parallel reaction pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major Pathway): Abstraction of H from C6.**\n        1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step.\n        4.  The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor Pathway): Abstraction of D from C2.**\n        1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This is slower than abstracting H⁺.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2.\n        4.  The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process. The intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne)**\n    The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks the highly reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH₂) attaches to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ gives a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The amino group (-NH₂) attaches to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ gives a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to assign the -NH₂ group position 1, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        So, Pathway A produces two distinct organic products.\n\n    *   **Product from Pathway B (via benzyne):**\n        The nucleophile NH₂⁻ attacks the symmetrical, non-deuterated benzyne. Attack at C1 or C2 leads to the same intermediate carbanion, which is then protonated by NH₃.\n        1.  The only product formed is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        So, Pathway B produces one organic product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Products**\n    By considering all possible reaction pathways, we have identified three unique organic products:\n    1.  2-Deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    2.  3-Deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\n    Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
