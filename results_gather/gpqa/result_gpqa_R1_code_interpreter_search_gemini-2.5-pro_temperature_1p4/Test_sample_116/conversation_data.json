    "An analysis of each compound is required to determine if it can exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules, which are molecules that are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common test for chirality is the absence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This is a biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a carbon-carbon single bond.\n    *   The molecule has large, bulky substituents at all four *ortho* positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'): two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃) and two nitro groups (-NO₂).\n    *   These bulky groups cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents the free rotation of the phenyl rings around the central C-C single bond.\n    *   This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar conformation.\n    *   This non-planar conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral.\n    *   This type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation about a single bond, is known as **atropisomerism**. Molecules that exhibit atropisomerism can exist as a pair of stable enantiomers (optical isomers).\n    *   Thus, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   This molecule is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group):\n        *   Group 1: -H (hydrogen)\n        *   Group 2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   Group 3: -CH₃ (methyl)\n        *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center (or asymmetric carbon).\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. It can exist as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n    *   Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   The structure of benzophenone is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅.\n    *   The molecule consists of a central carbonyl group attached to two identical phenyl groups.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the central carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   A molecule that possesses a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Achiral molecules are superimposable on their mirror images and do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   Thus, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid.\n    *   Its structure has the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   It possesses a center of inversion (or center of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. If you take any atom, draw a line through this center, you will find an identical atom at the same distance on the other side.\n    *   A molecule that possesses a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, only compounds 1 (due to atropisomerism) and 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
