    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atoms in different energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium. The problem states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which allows us to use this equation.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The distribution of atoms among different energy levels in a system in LTE is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `N_j / N_i` is the ratio of the number of atoms in energy level `j` to the number of atoms in energy level `i`.\n    *   `g_j / g_i` is the ratio of the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `E_j - E_i = ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Define \"Excitation Level\":** The term \"excitation\" in this context refers to the ratio of atoms in an excited state to a lower state (e.g., the ground state). Let's represent this ratio for a given star as `R = N_j / N_i`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Boltzmann equation to both stars:**\n    *   For star_1, with temperature `T_1`:\n        `R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n    *   For star_2, with temperature `T_2`:\n        `R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n    The energy levels and statistical weights are properties of the iron atom, so `ΔE` and `(g_j / g_i)` are the same for both stars.\n\n4.  **Use the information from the problem:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Mathematically, this is:\n    `R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relation:**\n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for statistical weights `(g_j / g_i)` appears on both sides and can be canceled out.\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n7.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To deal with the exponentials, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides.\n    `ln( exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) ) = ln( 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) )`\n\n    Using logarithm properties (`ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`):\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n8.  **Isolate `ln(2)`:** Rearrange the equation to solve for `ln(2)`.\n    `ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n9.  **Factor and simplify:** Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`.\n    `(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n    `(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n10. **Use the given numerical values:** The problem states the energy difference is `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`. Let's calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`.\n\n    ```python\n    # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n    k = 1.380649e-23\n    # Energy difference in J\n    delta_E = 1.38e-23\n    \n    # Calculate the ratio\n    ratio = delta_E / k\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    ```output\n    0.9995300188523351\n    ```\n    The ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately 1. The problem is designed such that we can use the approximation `ΔE / k ≈ 1 K`.\n\n11. **Final Equation:** Substituting `ΔE / k = 1` into our derived expression:\n    `1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n    `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\n12. **Compare with Options:** This final equation matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
