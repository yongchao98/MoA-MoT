The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.\n\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C12H12O2\nD) C12H14O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU (also known as the double bond equivalent) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n\n    *   A) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n    *   B) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n\n2.  **Determine the DoU from the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   **Ester group (-COO-):** The carbonyl (C=O) bond accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **Vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n\n    Adding these up, the total required DoU for the molecule is 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = **6**.\n\n3.  **Compare and Eliminate Options:**\n    *   The calculated DoU from the spectroscopic data is 6.\n    *   This matches the DoU for options A (C11H12O2) and C (C12H14O2).\n    *   We can eliminate options B (DoU=5) and D (DoU=7).\n\n4.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Fragments to Build the Structure:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring with only two signals for its 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical *para* (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is **C6H4**.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to another group. The proton adjacent to the ring is split into a doublet by the other vinyl proton. The second vinyl proton is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3 group. This fragment is **-CH=CH-CH3**, which has a formula of **C3H5**.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group identified above. The second -CH3 signal must come from the ester group.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or similar. To have a methyl group and no methylene groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH3**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula:**\n    Let's add the formulas of the identified fragments:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group: C3H5\n    *   Ester part: C2H3O2\n\n    Total Carbons = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    Total Hydrogens = 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    Total Oxygens = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This matches option A. It is not possible to construct a molecule with the formula C12H14O2 that fits all the given NMR constraints (especially the \"no -CH2-\" rule and the specific vinyl splitting).\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we can systematically deduce its structure from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₆) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two other groups. The core of this part of the molecule is therefore C₆H₄. The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms this with two signals for aromatic hydrogens, suggesting a symmetrical substitution pattern like a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** This tells us the compound contains a -COO- functional group, which accounts for one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** As mentioned, this corresponds to the C₆H₄ group. (4 hydrogens)\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a `-CH=CH-CH₃` group. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighboring vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. This fragment adds C₃H₅ to the molecule (1 vinyl-H + 1 vinyl-H + 3 methyl-H).\n    *   **Two –CH₃ group signals:** One methyl signal comes from the `-CH=CH-CH₃` group identified above. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. Since there are no –CH₂ signals, it cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, it must be either a methyl ester (–COOCH₃) or an acetate group (CH₃COO–). Both possibilities add a CH₃ group. (3 hydrogens)\n    *   **No –CH₂ group signals:** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate other possibilities.\n\n### Assembling the Structure and Determining the Formula\n\nLet's assemble the identified fragments to build the molecule and calculate its formula:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄ (6 carbons, 4 hydrogens)\n*   **Propenyl Group:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens)\n*   **Ester Group:** This group has two possible connectivities, but both lead to the same formula.\n    *   **Case 1: Methyl ester:** The substituents on the ring are `-CH=CH-CH₃` and `-COOCH₃`. The `-COOCH₃` fragment adds C₂H₃O₂ (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three hydrogens, two oxygens).\n    *   **Case 2: Acetate ester:** The substituents on the ring are `-CH=CH-CH₃` and `-OOCCH₃`. The `-OOCCH₃` fragment adds C₂H₃O₂ (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three hydrogens, two oxygens).\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms for the entire molecule:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from the ester part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's methyl group) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis formula corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 6 (one ring, four double bonds: three in the ring, one vinyl, and one carbonyl), which is consistent with the proposed structure. The other options can be ruled out as they do not match the atom count derived from the detailed NMR analysis, particularly the constraint of having no -CH₂- groups.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:** We will break down the information from FTIR and 1H NMR to identify the key structural fragments of the molecule.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The presence of only two signals for aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which gives a `C6H4` fragment.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** There are two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This pattern is characteristic of a `-CH=CH-CH3` group. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the `-CH3` is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). This fragment is a propenyl group, `C3H5`.\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** There are two `-CH3` signals. We've already identified one in the propenyl group. This means there is one other `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **No -CH2- Groups:** This is a critical constraint that helps eliminate potential structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:** We will combine the identified fragments to build the complete molecule and count the atoms to find its chemical formula.\n    *   Fragment 1: `C6H4` (para-substituted benzene ring)\n    *   Fragment 2: `-COO-` (ester group)\n    *   Fragment 3: `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl group)\n    *   Fragment 4: `-CH3` (a second methyl group)\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from ester C=O) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from the other methyl) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from the other methyl) = 12\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester)\n\n    The assembled formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** We'll calculate the DoU from both the structure and the formula to ensure they match.\n    *   **DoU from structure:** 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 6\n    *   **DoU from formula C11H12O2:** `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6`\n    The DoU values match, confirming our structure is plausible.\n\n4.  **Select the Final Answer:** We will compare our derived formula with the given options. The formula C11H12O2 corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the information to identify molecular fragments.\n# Aromatic ring: Di-substituted with 2 H signals implies a para-substituted C6H4 ring.\n# FTIR: An ester group (-COO-) is present.\n# Vinyl group: A doublet and a doublet of quartets in the vinyl region indicates a -CH=CH-CH3 group.\n# Methyl groups: Two -CH3 signals are observed.

This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents, giving a C6H4 core.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This tells us the compound contains two oxygen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O). All the given formula options have O2, which is consistent.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Total Signals:** Six distinct signals, meaning there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Aromatic-H:** Two signals. A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4) substitution, which would give an AA'BB' system appearing as two doublets. This accounts for a C6H4 fragment and 4 protons.\n    *   **Vinyl-H:** Two signals. Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**. This proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This proton is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons, i.e., a methyl group (giving the quartet).\n        *   This specific splitting pattern (d and dq) is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment accounts for 5 protons (1H + 1H + 3H).\n    *   **-CH3 Groups:** Two signals. This means there are two methyl groups in different chemical environments.\n        *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group identified above.\n        *   The other methyl group must be a separate substituent. This accounts for 3 protons.\n    *   **-CH2 Groups:** No signals. This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates any structures containing ethyl, propyl, or other groups with a -CH2- unit.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the structural fragments.**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  A para-substituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n2.  An ester linkage: -COO-\n3.  A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n4.  A methyl group: -CH3\n\nWe need to combine these fragments into a single molecule. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the two substituents must be attached to the C6H4 ring.\n\n*   **Possibility A:** The substituents on the ring are the methyl group (-CH3) and an ester group where the propenyl group is the alcohol part (-COO-CH=CH-CH3). This gives the structure **propenyl 4-methylbenzoate**. This structure is consistent with all the NMR data.\n*   **Possibility B:** The substituents on the ring are the methyl group (-CH3) and an ester group where the propenyl group is the acid part (-OOC-CH=CH-CH3). This gives the structure **4-methylphenyl 2-butenoate**. This structure is also consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the chemical formula from the assembled structure.**\n\nLet's calculate the chemical formula for either of the possible structures, as they are isomers and will have the same formula. We will use propenyl 4-methylbenzoate.\n\n*   **Count the Carbon atoms (C):**\n    *   From the methyl group on the ring: 1\n    *   From the benzene ring: 6\n    *   From the ester carbonyl group (C=O): 1\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3\n    *   **Total Carbon = 1 + 6 + 1 + 3 = 11**\n*   **Count the Hydrogen atoms (H):**\n    *   From the methyl group on the ring: 3\n    *   From the benzene ring: 4\n    *   From the propenyl group: 5 (1+1+3)\n    *   **Total Hydrogen = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12**\n*   **Count the Oxygen atoms (O):**\n    *   From the ester group: 2\n    *   **Total Oxygen = 2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the calculated formula with the given options.**\n\n*   A) C12H14O2\n*   B) C12H12O2\n*   C) C11H14O2\n*   D) C11H12O2\n\nOur calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n**Careful Points Check:**\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C11H12O2, DBE = (2*11 + 2 - 12)/2 = 6. This perfectly matches the structure: 4 for the benzene ring, 1 for the C=C double bond, and 1 for the C=O double bond.\n*   **Check other options:**\n    *   C11H14O2 (DBE=5): Incorrect DBE.\n    *   C12H12O2 (DBE=7): Incorrect DBE.\n    *   C12H14O2 (DBE=6): While the DBE is correct, this formula has an extra CH2 group compared to C11H12O2. The problem explicitly states there are no -CH2- signals in the NMR, ruling this option out.\n\nTherefore, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is my reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents. This structure itself accounts for a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 4 (one for the ring and three for the double bonds).\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This adds 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **1H NMR shows vinyl-H:** Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond. This adds another 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Total Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The total DoU required for the molecule is the sum of these contributions: 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = 6.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DoU for Each Option:**\n    The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - H/2`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens (oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation). I will use a Python script to calculate this for each option to ensure accuracy.\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_dou(formula):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula.\"\"\"\n        import re\n        parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d+)', formula)\n        counts = {el: int(num) for el, num in parts}\n        C = counts.get('C', 0)\n        H = counts.get('H', 0)\n        # DoU = C + 1 - H/2\n        dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n        return dou\n\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C11H12O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C11H14O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C12H14O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C12H12O2\"\n    }\n\n    expected_dou = 6\n    print(f\"Expected DoU based on structure: {expected_dou}\")\n    for label, formula in options.items():\n        dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n        print(f\"Option {label} ({formula}): DoU = {int(dou)}\")\n\n    ```\n    \n    **Execution Output:**\n    ```\n    Expected DoU based on structure: 6\n    Option A (C11H12O2): DoU = 6\n    Option B (C11H14O2): DoU = 5\n    Option C (C12H14O2): DoU = 6\n    Option D (C12H12O2): DoU = 7\n    ```\n    This calculation eliminates options B and D, as their DoU does not match the required value of 6. The correct answer must be either A (C11H12O2) or C (C12H14O2).\n\n3.  **Detailed Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** For a di-substituted benzene ring, two signals typically indicate a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern, which results in chemical symmetry. This means the ring fragment is C6H4.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals, one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. The proton on the first vinyl carbon is split into a doublet by its neighbor. The proton on the second vinyl carbon is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the three protons of the methyl group, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment is `C3H5`.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One signal is from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`), which would be a doublet. The other signal must come from the ester part of the molecule. Since there are no `-CH2-` groups, this cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`). It must be a methyl group, either as a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-OCOCH3`). In either case, this fragment is `CH3`.\n    *   **No -CH2- groups:** This is a crucial constraint.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the fragments identified from the NMR data:\n    *   Aromatic ring: `C6H4`\n    *   Propenyl group: `C3H5`\n    *   Ester group: `-COO-` -> `CO2`\n    *   Second methyl group: `CH3`\n\n    Total Carbon atoms = 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (methyl) = 11\n    Total Hydrogen atoms = 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl) = 12\n    Total Oxygen atoms = 2 (ester)\n\n    The molecular formula derived from the spectroscopic data is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Final Check and Elimination:**\n    *   The derived formula `C11H12O2` matches option A.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate option C (`C12H14O2`). To get from `C11H12O2` to `C12H14O2`, we would need to add one carbon and two hydrogens, which is a `-CH2-` group. However, the problem explicitly states there are no signals for `-CH2-` groups. Therefore, `C12H14O2` is incorrect.\n    *   Another way to disprove `C12H14O2` is by proton count. Total protons = 14. The fragments we identified (`C6H4`, `-CH=CH-CH3`) account for 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (propenyl methyl) = 9 protons. This leaves 14 - 9 = 5 protons to be accounted for by the second methyl signal. A methyl signal must integrate to a multiple of 3 (e.g., 3H, 6H), so 5 protons is impossible.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the only formula that fits all the given data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Core Structure:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₆) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core formula of this part is C₆H₄. The ring itself accounts for four degrees of unsaturation (one for the ring and three for the double bonds).\n    *   **Ester group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester group (-COO-). This group contains one carbon, two oxygen atoms, and a carbon-oxygen double bond, which adds one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** The absence of signals for –CH₂ groups is a crucial constraint, eliminating many possible structures, such as those containing ethyl or propyl chains.\n\n2.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons (C₆H₄). The presence of only two signals for these four protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para) substitution, which would result in two distinct proton environments.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) attached to the aromatic ring.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet). The combined splitting results in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This propenyl group (-C₃H₅) adds one more degree of unsaturation from its carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:**\n        *   One methyl signal corresponds to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-C**H₃**).\n        *   The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group. Since there are no –CH₂ groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOC**H₂**CH₃). Therefore, it must be either a methyl ester (-COOC**H₃**) or an acetate group (-OCOC**H₃**).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n\nLet's assemble the identified fragments to build the complete molecule and calculate its formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (which has a formula of C₃H₅)\n*   **Ester and second Methyl Group:** This must be either a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃, formula C₂H₃O₂) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃, formula C₂H₃O₂). Both possibilities have the same atomic count.\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2** (from C₂H₃O₂)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation:**\nThe formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ has a degree of unsaturation of 6.\n(DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6).\nThe proposed structure contains:\n*   1 aromatic ring (4 degrees)\n*   1 vinyl C=C double bond (1 degree)\n*   1 ester C=O double bond (1 degree)\nThe total degrees of unsaturation for the structure is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6, which matches the calculated value from the formula.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\nThe spectroscopic data unambiguously points to a molecular structure with the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This corresponds to option B. Examples of such a compound would be methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate or 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is determined by systematically identifying its structural fragments.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed.\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**: This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents (a C₆H₄ group). The presence of only two signals for the aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which results in a symmetrical structure with two equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Ester Group and Methyl Signals**: The FTIR shows an ester. The ¹H NMR shows two -CH₃ signals and, crucially, no -CH₂ signals. An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or any longer-chain ester would contain -CH₂ groups. Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) to avoid any -CH₂ signals. This accounts for one of the two -CH₃ signals observed.\n    *   **Vinyl and Second Methyl Group**: The remaining signals are two vinyl protons (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) and a second -CH₃ group. This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). In this fragment, the vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton and the three methyl protons, resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighboring vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet. The methyl group is split by one vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet. This accounts for the two vinyl signals and the second -CH₃ signal.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nBy combining the identified fragments, we can deduce the structure and its chemical formula:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring**: C₆H₄\n*   **Substituent 1 (Ester)**: -COOCH₃ (which contains C₂H₃O₂)\n*   **Substituent 2 (Vinyl group)**: -CH=CH-CH₃ (which contains C₃H₅)\n\nThe complete structure is Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n### Calculating the Chemical Formula\n\nSumming the atoms from all fragments:\n\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 (from ring) + 2 (from ester) + 3 (from propenyl) = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 (from ring) + 3 (from ester) + 5 (from propenyl) = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (from ester)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula corresponds to the identified structure, which is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the core structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The formula for this part of the molecule is therefore C6H4.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR data:** The spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms, accounting for the \"O2\" part of the chemical formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR data:** This provides the most detailed information about the substituents.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint, eliminating any structures that contain a methylene group.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a simple doublet. This confirms the presence of a –CH=CH–CH3 substituent. This group contains one of the two required –CH3 signals.\n    *   **Finding the second –CH3 group:** The ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl signal can be explained by a methyl ester functional group (–COOCH3). This structure provides the second –CH3 signal and does not contain any –CH2 groups.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, such as para-substitution, where there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons.\n\n4.  **Assemble the structure and determine the formula:**\n    *   The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3) and a methyl ester group (–COOCH3).\n    *   Let's sum the atoms to find the molecular formula:\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the C6H4 ring) + 1 (from the –COO– group) + 1 (from the –OCH3 group) + 3 (from the –CH=CH–CH3 group) = 11 carbons.\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the C6H4 ring) + 3 (from the –OCH3 group) + 4 (from the –CH=CH–CH3 group) = 11 hydrogens. Let's re-count the hydrogens on the propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3 has 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 hydrogens. So, the total hydrogen count is 4 (aromatic) + 3 (ester methyl) + 5 (propenyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify against the options:**\n    *   **C11H12O2:** This matches our derived formula.\n    *   **C11H14O2:** This would require saturating the double bond of the propenyl group to a propyl group (–CH2CH2CH3), which would introduce –CH2 signals, contradicting the NMR data.\n    *   **C12H12O2 and C12H14O2:** These formulas would require adding more carbons and hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the clear interpretation of the NMR signals that perfectly account for a C11H12O2 structure without any –CH2 groups.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic information, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This is a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents, giving a C6H4 core.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates an \"ester group\". An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and one C-O single bond. This adds -COO- to our molecular fragments, which consists of 1 Carbon and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:** The NMR spectrum gives the most detailed clues about the structure.\n    *   **Six signals total:** This tells us there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals suggests a high degree of symmetry. This is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substitution pattern**. In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents (X-C6H4-Y), the four protons form an AA'BB' system, which typically resolves into two signals (often two doublets). This accounts for the C6H4 part of the structure.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(b) is split by both H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is only split by the adjacent H(b), resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This perfectly matches the description and confirms the presence of a -CH=CH-CH3 group.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) we just identified. This methyl group is coupled to a vinyl proton, so its signal would be a doublet.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must come from the other part of the molecule. Since we have an ester group and no other place for a methyl group (as there are no -CH2- groups), it must be part of the ester. This could be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH3). In either case, this methyl group is not adjacent to any protons, so its signal would be a singlet.\n        *   This accounts for two distinct -CH3 signals.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out the presence of groups like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), etc.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure and Determine the Formula:**\n    Based on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n    *   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n    *   A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n    *   An ester group that incorporates a methyl group.\n\n    There are two plausible ways to connect these fragments:\n    *   **Possibility A: Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**\n        The propenyl group and the methyl ester group are attached to the benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions.\n        Structure: CH3-CH=CH–C6H4–COOCH3\n    *   **Possibility B: 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate**\n        The propenyl group and the acetate group are attached to the benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions.\n        Structure: CH3-CH=CH–C6H4–OOCCH3\n\n    Now, let's determine the molecular formula for these structures.\n    *   **For both structures:**\n        *   Benzene ring (C6H4): 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n        *   Propenyl group (C3H5): 3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens\n        *   Ester part (COO) + Methyl part (CH3): 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n    *   **Total Count:**\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated formula is C11H12O2. Let's compare this with the options provided:\n    A) C12H12O2\n    B) C11H14O2\n    C) C11H12O2\n    D) C12H14O2\n\n    Our derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\n    Let's quickly check why the other options are incorrect:\n    *   **C11H14O2:** Compared to C11H12O2, this formula has two extra hydrogens. This would imply the absence of the C=C double bond in the propenyl group (making it a propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3). A propyl group contains -CH2- signals, which are explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n    *   **C12H14O2:** This formula has an extra CH2 group compared to our derived C11H12O2. Again, this is ruled out by the absence of -CH2- signals.\n    *   **C12H12O2:** This formula has an extra carbon atom compared to C11H12O2. It is not possible to add another carbon atom to the proposed structure without either introducing a -CH2- group or violating the other NMR signal constraints.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that perfectly fits all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aromatic Ring Information:**\n    *   The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens with two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons is a strong indication of para (1,4) substitution. This high degree of symmetry makes pairs of protons chemically equivalent, simplifying the spectrum to two signals (typically two doublets). This C6H4 fragment accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Group Information:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows the presence of an **ester group**. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms. This accounts for the O2 part of all the proposed chemical formulas.\n    *   The ester group also contains a carbonyl (C=O) bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Signals for the Substituents:**\n    *   **Vinyl Protons:** There are \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H\". This means there is a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) with a hydrogen attached to each carbon. The signals are described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\".\n        *   A **doublet** means a proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   A **doublet of quartets (dq)** means a proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving the doublet splitting) and a set of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet splitting).\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c).\n            *   Proton H(b) is coupled to H(a), so its signal would be a doublet.\n            *   Proton H(a) is coupled to H(b) (giving a doublet) and the three H(c) protons (giving a quartet). Its signal would be a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This perfectly matches the description. So, one of the substituents on the ring is a propenyl group. This group has the formula -C3H5 and accounts for the two vinyl-H signals and one of the -CH3 signals.\n\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\".\n        *   We have already identified one -CH3 group as part of the propenyl substituent.\n        *   The second -CH3 group must be part of the other substituent, which we know is an ester.\n\n    *   **Absence of -CH2 Groups:** The spectrum has \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\". This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates possibilities like ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) or longer alkyl chains.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Pieces and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a **para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4)**.\n    *   One substituent is a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**, which has a formula of C3H5.\n    *   The other substituent is an ester that contains a methyl group. The only way to form this without a -CH2- group is to have a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate ester (-OOCCH3)**. Both of these fragments have the formula C2H3O2.\n    *   Let's combine these fragments to build the whole molecule. A plausible structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n    *   Now, let's sum the atoms to find the total chemical formula:\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 2 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **11 Carbons**\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **12 Hydrogens**\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   The formula for DBE is: C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   For C11H12O2, DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Our proposed structure has:\n        *   1 aromatic ring (4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds)\n        *   1 C=C double bond in the propenyl group (1 degree of unsaturation)\n        *   1 C=O double bond in the ester group (1 degree of unsaturation)\n    *   Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. The calculated DBE matches the structure, confirming its validity.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The deduced formula C11H12O2 matches option C. The other formulas are inconsistent with the spectroscopic data. For instance, C11H14O2 would have a DBE of 5, and C12 formulas would require an additional carbon atom, which cannot be accommodated without violating the NMR data constraints (e.g., by adding a CH2 group).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Structure Information:**\n    *   **Core:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens. The core of the molecule is therefore a **C6H4** group.\n    *   **FTIR:** The spectrum shows an **ester group** (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms present in all the formula options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Signals to Identify the Substituents:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as only two signals indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para) arrangement.\n    *   **Vinyl-H and one -CH3 group:** The spectrum shows two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) along with one of the -CH3 signals. This is a classic splitting pattern for a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3). This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Second -CH3 group:** The spectrum shows a second, distinct -CH3 signal. Since we know from the FTIR that there is an ester, this methyl group must be part of that ester functionality (e.g., a methyl ester, -COOCH3, or an acetate ester, -OCOCH3). This fragment contributes **C2H3O2** to the overall formula.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of negative evidence.

Incorrect. This formula lacks the C=C double bond required by the vinyl-H signals.\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 6. Incorrect. This formula is equivalent to C11H12O2 + a CH2 group. The NMR data explicitly states there are **no -CH2- groups**.\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 7. Incorrect. This would require an extra ring or double bond not supported by the data.\n\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on the analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, we can deduce the structure and molecular formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The 1H NMR shows two signals for aromatic protons, which is characteristic of a 1,4- (para) substituted benzene ring. This fragment accounts for **C6H4**.\n\n2.  **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This adds **2 oxygen atoms** and a carbonyl group (C=O) to the structure.\n\n3.  **Vinyl Group:** The 1H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This specific splitting pattern is indicative of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**. This fragment contains **C3H5** and a C=C double bond.\n\n4.  **Methyl Groups:** The 1H NMR shows two -CH3 signals.\n    *   One -CH3 group is part of the propenyl group identified above.\n    *   The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester. Since there are no -CH2- signals, it cannot be an ethyl ester. It must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3). In either case, this part of the molecule contributes **C1H3**.\n\n5.  **Assembling the Fragments:** Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 1 (from ester carbonyl C) + 1 (from ester methyl C) = **11 Carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from ester methyl H) = **12 Hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n\n6.  **Molecular Formula:** The assembled structure gives a molecular formula of **C11H12O2**.\n\n7.  **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   From the structure: 1 ring (DBE=1) + 3 double bonds in the ring (DBE=3) + 1 C=C double bond (DBE=1) + 1 C=O double bond (DBE=1) = **Total DBE of 6**.\n    *   From the formula C11H12O2: DBE = C - H/2 + 1 = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**.\n    *   The DBE matches, confirming the formula is correct.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, C11H12O2 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is determined by systematically analyzing its constituent parts.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Proton (¹H) Count:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H:** The prompt describes a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two signals for aromatic protons. This pattern, often an AA'BB' system, is characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring, which has a total of 4 aromatic protons.\n    *   **Vinyl-H:** There are two signals for vinyl protons—one doublet and one doublet of quartets. This splitting pattern is indicative of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). This group contains 2 vinyl protons.\n    *   **Methyl (-CH₃) Groups:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl groups. One signal corresponds to the methyl group of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH₃`) substituent. The other methyl signal must belong to the ester group, as no other structural source is suggested. Since the problem states there are no methylene (`-CH₂`) groups, this methyl must be directly attached to the ester functionality (i.e., a methyl ester or an acetyl group). Each methyl group contributes 3 protons, for a total of 6 protons from these two groups.\n    *   **Total Protons:** Summing these up gives a total of 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = 12 protons.\n\n2.  **Carbon Count:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted benzene ring contributes 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** The `-CH=CH-CH₃` group adds 3 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester (`-COO-`). The NMR data indicates a methyl group is part of this functionality, with no adjacent `-CH₂` groups. This leads to two possibilities for the ester substituent: a methoxycarbonyl group (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). Both of these groups contain 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Total Carbons:** The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester) = 11 carbons.\n\n3.  **Oxygen Count:**\n    *   The ester functional group (`-COO-`) contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the counts for each element, the molecular formula is determined to be **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic information. Compounds such as (E)-methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate and 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate are isomers that fit this formula and the spectral data described.\n\nThis eliminates the other options:\n*   `C₁₂H₁₂O₂`: Incorrect carbon count.\n*   `C₁₂H₁₄O₂`: Incorrect carbon and hydrogen counts, and would likely contain `-CH₂` groups, which are explicitly absent.\n*   `C₁₁H₁₄O₂`: Incorrect hydrogen count and would imply a saturated alkyl chain instead of a propenyl group, contradicting the vinyl-H signals.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a C₆H₄ group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the chemical formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed clues about the attached groups.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint, eliminating any structures with ethyl, propyl, or other similar alkyl chains.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** This means there are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃).\n        *   The proton on the middle carbon is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The proton on the terminal carbon (attached to the ring) is split only by the adjacent vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   This confirms one of the substituents is a propenyl group (–C₃H₅), which also accounts for one of the two –CH₃ signals.\n    *   **Assembling the second substituent:** We still need to place the ester group (–COO–) and the second –CH₃ group. The only way to do this without creating a –CH₂– group is to form a methyl ester (–COOCH₃). This accounts for the second –CH₃ signal.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two different groups, such as a propenyl group and a methyl ester group, would show distinct signals for the aromatic protons, consistent with the \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" description (likely an AA'BB' system if para-substituted).\n\n4.  **Construct the Molecule and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring: C₆H₄\n    *   We have a propenyl group: –CH=CH–CH₃ (which is C₃H₅)\n    *   We have a methyl ester group: –COOCH₃ (which is C₂H₃O₂)\n\n    Now, let's add up the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** **2** (from ester)\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Other Options:**\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This would require saturating the double bond of the propenyl group to a propyl group (–CH₂CH₂CH₃), which would introduce –CH₂– signals, contradicting the NMR data.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** Adding another carbon or a carbon and two hydrogens without introducing a –CH₂– group and while keeping the other NMR-defined fragments is not feasible. For instance, adding a CH₂ group is explicitly ruled out.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only possible formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group, which has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is consistent with a di-substituted benzene ring, particularly a para-substituted one where the two substituents are different.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** The absence of signals for –CH2 groups is a critical constraint, eliminating many possible structures.\n    *   **Two –CH3 groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** The signals for a doublet and a doublet of quartets are characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl hydrogen, resulting in a doublet. The second vinyl hydrogen is split by the first vinyl hydrogen (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet), which results in a doublet of quartets. The methyl group of this substituent would appear as a doublet, accounting for one of the two –CH3 signals.\n    *   **The second –CH3 group:** This methyl group must be part of the ester. Since there are no –CH2 groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH2CH3). Therefore, it must be a methyl ester (–COOCH3). This accounts for the second –CH3 signal, which would appear as a singlet.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    Based on the analysis, the molecule consists of:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n    *   A propenyl group (–CH=CHCH3).\n    *   A methyl ester group (–COOCH3).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Chemical Formula:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the benzene ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from the methyl ester group) = 11 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the benzene ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group: 1+1+3) + 3 (from the methyl ester group) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    The degree of unsaturation for C11H12O2 is calculated as:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    This matches the structural features: 4 for the aromatic ring, 1 for the vinyl C=C double bond, and 1 for the ester C=O double bond.\n\nComparing this calculated formula to the given options:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

The formula is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n\n    *   A) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n    *   B) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n\n2.  **Determine the DoU from the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   **Ester group (-COO-):** The carbonyl (C=O) bond accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **Vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n\n    Adding these up, the total required DoU for the molecule is 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = **6**.\n\n3.  **Compare and Eliminate Options:**\n    *   The calculated DoU from the spectroscopic data is 6.\n    *   This matches the DoU for options A (C11H12O2) and C (C12H14O2).\n    *   We can eliminate options B (DoU=5) and D (DoU=7).\n\n4.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Fragments to Build the Structure:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring with only two signals for its 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical *para* (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is **C6H4**.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to another group. The proton adjacent to the ring is split into a doublet by the other vinyl proton. The second vinyl proton is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3 group. This fragment is **-CH=CH-CH3**, which has a formula of **C3H5**.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group identified above. The second -CH3 signal must come from the ester group.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or similar. To have a methyl group and no methylene groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH3**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula:**\n    Let's add the formulas of the identified fragments:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group: C3H5\n    *   Ester part: C2H3O2\n\n    Total Carbons = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    Total Hydrogens = 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    Total Oxygens = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This matches option A. It is not possible to construct a molecule with the formula C12H14O2 that fits all the given NMR constraints (especially the \"no -CH2-\" rule and the specific vinyl splitting).\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we can systematically deduce its structure from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₆) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two other groups. The core of this part of the molecule is therefore C₆H₄. The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms this with two signals for aromatic hydrogens, suggesting a symmetrical substitution pattern like a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** This tells us the compound contains a -COO- functional group, which accounts for one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** As mentioned, this corresponds to the C₆H₄ group. (4 hydrogens)\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a `-CH=CH-CH₃` group. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighboring vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. This fragment adds C₃H₅ to the molecule (1 vinyl-H + 1 vinyl-H + 3 methyl-H).\n    *   **Two –CH₃ group signals:** One methyl signal comes from the `-CH=CH-CH₃` group identified above. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. Since there are no –CH₂ signals, it cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, it must be either a methyl ester (–COOCH₃) or an acetate group (CH₃COO–). Both possibilities add a CH₃ group. (3 hydrogens)\n    *   **No –CH₂ group signals:** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate other possibilities.\n\n### Assembling the Structure and Determining the Formula\n\nLet's assemble the identified fragments to build the molecule and calculate its formula:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄ (6 carbons, 4 hydrogens)\n*   **Propenyl Group:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens)\n*   **Ester Group:** This group has two possible connectivities, but both lead to the same formula.\n    *   **Case 1: Methyl ester:** The substituents on the ring are `-CH=CH-CH₃` and `-COOCH₃`. The `-COOCH₃` fragment adds C₂H₃O₂ (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three hydrogens, two oxygens).\n    *   **Case 2: Acetate ester:** The substituents on the ring are `-CH=CH-CH₃` and `-OOCCH₃`. The `-OOCCH₃` fragment adds C₂H₃O₂ (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three hydrogens, two oxygens).\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms for the entire molecule:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from the ester part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's methyl group) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis formula corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 6 (one ring, four double bonds: three in the ring, one vinyl, and one carbonyl), which is consistent with the proposed structure. The other options can be ruled out as they do not match the atom count derived from the detailed NMR analysis, particularly the constraint of having no -CH₂- groups.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:** We will break down the information from FTIR and 1H NMR to identify the key structural fragments of the molecule.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The presence of only two signals for aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which gives a `C6H4` fragment.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** There are two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This pattern is characteristic of a `-CH=CH-CH3` group. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the `-CH3` is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). This fragment is a propenyl group, `C3H5`.\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** There are two `-CH3` signals. We've already identified one in the propenyl group. This means there is one other `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **No -CH2- Groups:** This is a critical constraint that helps eliminate potential structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:** We will combine the identified fragments to build the complete molecule and count the atoms to find its chemical formula.\n    *   Fragment 1: `C6H4` (para-substituted benzene ring)\n    *   Fragment 2: `-COO-` (ester group)\n    *   Fragment 3: `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl group)\n    *   Fragment 4: `-CH3` (a second methyl group)\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from ester C=O) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from the other methyl) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from the other methyl) = 12\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester)\n\n    The assembled formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** We'll calculate the DoU from both the structure and the formula to ensure they match.\n    *   **DoU from structure:** 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 6\n    *   **DoU from formula C11H12O2:** `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6`\n    The DoU values match, confirming our structure is plausible.\n\n4.  **Select the Final Answer:** We will compare our derived formula with the given options.

This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents, giving a C6H4 core.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This tells us the compound contains two oxygen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O). All the given formula options have O2, which is consistent.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Total Signals:** Six distinct signals, meaning there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Aromatic-H:** Two signals. A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4) substitution, which would give an AA'BB' system appearing as two doublets. This accounts for a C6H4 fragment and 4 protons.\n    *   **Vinyl-H:** Two signals. Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**. This proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This proton is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons, i.e., a methyl group (giving the quartet).\n        *   This specific splitting pattern (d and dq) is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment accounts for 5 protons (1H + 1H + 3H).\n    *   **-CH3 Groups:** Two signals. This means there are two methyl groups in different chemical environments.\n        *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group identified above.\n        *   The other methyl group must be a separate substituent. This accounts for 3 protons.\n    *   **-CH2 Groups:** No signals. This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates any structures containing ethyl, propyl, or other groups with a -CH2- unit.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the structural fragments.**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  A para-substituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n2.  An ester linkage: -COO-\n3.  A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n4.  A methyl group: -CH3\n\nWe need to combine these fragments into a single molecule. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the two substituents must be attached to the C6H4 ring.\n\n*   **Possibility A:** The substituents on the ring are the methyl group (-CH3) and an ester group where the propenyl group is the alcohol part (-COO-CH=CH-CH3). This gives the structure **propenyl 4-methylbenzoate**. This structure is consistent with all the NMR data.\n*   **Possibility B:** The substituents on the ring are the methyl group (-CH3) and an ester group where the propenyl group is the acid part (-OOC-CH=CH-CH3). This gives the structure **4-methylphenyl 2-butenoate**. This structure is also consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the chemical formula from the assembled structure.**\n\nLet's calculate the chemical formula for either of the possible structures, as they are isomers and will have the same formula. We will use propenyl 4-methylbenzoate.\n\n*   **Count the Carbon atoms (C):**\n    *   From the methyl group on the ring: 1\n    *   From the benzene ring: 6\n    *   From the ester carbonyl group (C=O): 1\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3\n    *   **Total Carbon = 1 + 6 + 1 + 3 = 11**\n*   **Count the Hydrogen atoms (H):**\n    *   From the methyl group on the ring: 3\n    *   From the benzene ring: 4\n    *   From the propenyl group: 5 (1+1+3)\n    *   **Total Hydrogen = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12**\n*   **Count the Oxygen atoms (O):**\n    *   From the ester group: 2\n    *   **Total Oxygen = 2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the calculated formula with the given options.**\n\n*   A) C12H14O2\n*   B) C12H12O2\n*   C) C11H14O2\n*   D) C11H12O2\n\nOur calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n**Careful Points Check:**\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C11H12O2, DBE = (2*11 + 2 - 12)/2 = 6. This perfectly matches the structure: 4 for the benzene ring, 1 for the C=C double bond, and 1 for the C=O double bond.\n*   **Check other options:**\n    *   C11H14O2 (DBE=5): Incorrect DBE.\n    *   C12H12O2 (DBE=7): Incorrect DBE.\n    *   C12H14O2 (DBE=6): While the DBE is correct, this formula has an extra CH2 group compared to C11H12O2. The problem explicitly states there are no -CH2- signals in the NMR, ruling this option out.\n\nTherefore, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is my reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents. This structure itself accounts for a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 4 (one for the ring and three for the double bonds).\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This adds 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **1H NMR shows vinyl-H:** Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond. This adds another 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Total Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The total DoU required for the molecule is the sum of these contributions: 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = 6.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DoU for Each Option:**\n    The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - H/2`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens (oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation). I will use a Python script to calculate this for each option to ensure accuracy.\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_dou(formula):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula.\"\"\"\n        import re\n        parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d+)', formula)\n        counts = {el: int(num) for el, num in parts}\n        C = counts.get('C', 0)\n        H = counts.get('H', 0)\n        # DoU = C + 1 - H/2\n        dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n        return dou\n\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C11H12O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C11H14O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C12H14O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C12H12O2\"\n    }\n\n    expected_dou = 6\n    print(f\"Expected DoU based on structure: {expected_dou}\")\n    for label, formula in options.items():\n        dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n        print(f\"Option {label} ({formula}): DoU = {int(dou)}\")\n\n    ```\n    \n    **Execution Output:**\n    ```\n    Expected DoU based on structure: 6\n    Option A (C11H12O2): DoU = 6\n    Option B (C11H14O2): DoU = 5\n    Option C (C12H14O2): DoU = 6\n    Option D (C12H12O2): DoU = 7\n    ```\n    This calculation eliminates options B and D, as their DoU does not match the required value of 6. The correct answer must be either A (C11H12O2) or C (C12H14O2).\n\n3.  **Detailed Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** For a di-substituted benzene ring, two signals typically indicate a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern, which results in chemical symmetry. This means the ring fragment is C6H4.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals, one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. The proton on the first vinyl carbon is split into a doublet by its neighbor. The proton on the second vinyl carbon is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the three protons of the methyl group, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment is `C3H5`.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One signal is from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`), which would be a doublet. The other signal must come from the ester part of the molecule. Since there are no `-CH2-` groups, this cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`). It must be a methyl group, either as a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-OCOCH3`). In either case, this fragment is `CH3`.\n    *   **No -CH2- groups:** This is a crucial constraint.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the fragments identified from the NMR data:\n    *   Aromatic ring: `C6H4`\n    *   Propenyl group: `C3H5`\n    *   Ester group: `-COO-` -> `CO2`\n    *   Second methyl group: `CH3`\n\n    Total Carbon atoms = 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (methyl) = 11\n    Total Hydrogen atoms = 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl) = 12\n    Total Oxygen atoms = 2 (ester)\n\n    The molecular formula derived from the spectroscopic data is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Final Check and Elimination:**\n    *   The derived formula `C11H12O2` matches option A.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate option C (`C12H14O2`). To get from `C11H12O2` to `C12H14O2`, we would need to add one carbon and two hydrogens, which is a `-CH2-` group. However, the problem explicitly states there are no signals for `-CH2-` groups. Therefore, `C12H14O2` is incorrect.\n    *   Another way to disprove `C12H14O2` is by proton count. Total protons = 14. The fragments we identified (`C6H4`, `-CH=CH-CH3`) account for 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (propenyl methyl) = 9 protons. This leaves 14 - 9 = 5 protons to be accounted for by the second methyl signal. A methyl signal must integrate to a multiple of 3 (e.g., 3H, 6H), so 5 protons is impossible.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the only formula that fits all the given data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Core Structure:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₆) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core formula of this part is C₆H₄. The ring itself accounts for four degrees of unsaturation (one for the ring and three for the double bonds).\n    *   **Ester group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester group (-COO-). This group contains one carbon, two oxygen atoms, and a carbon-oxygen double bond, which adds one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** The absence of signals for –CH₂ groups is a crucial constraint, eliminating many possible structures, such as those containing ethyl or propyl chains.\n\n2.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons (C₆H₄). The presence of only two signals for these four protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para) substitution, which would result in two distinct proton environments.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) attached to the aromatic ring.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet). The combined splitting results in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This propenyl group (-C₃H₅) adds one more degree of unsaturation from its carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:**\n        *   One methyl signal corresponds to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-C**H₃**).\n        *   The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group. Since there are no –CH₂ groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOC**H₂**CH₃). Therefore, it must be either a methyl ester (-COOC**H₃**) or an acetate group (-OCOC**H₃**).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n\nLet's assemble the identified fragments to build the complete molecule and calculate its formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (which has a formula of C₃H₅)\n*   **Ester and second Methyl Group:** This must be either a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃, formula C₂H₃O₂) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃, formula C₂H₃O₂). Both possibilities have the same atomic count.\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2** (from C₂H₃O₂)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation:**\nThe formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ has a degree of unsaturation of 6.\n(DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6).\nThe proposed structure contains:\n*   1 aromatic ring (4 degrees)\n*   1 vinyl C=C double bond (1 degree)\n*   1 ester C=O double bond (1 degree)\nThe total degrees of unsaturation for the structure is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6, which matches the calculated value from the formula.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\nThe spectroscopic data unambiguously points to a molecular structure with the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This corresponds to option B. Examples of such a compound would be methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate or 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is determined by systematically identifying its structural fragments.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed.\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**: This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents (a C₆H₄ group). The presence of only two signals for the aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which results in a symmetrical structure with two equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Ester Group and Methyl Signals**: The FTIR shows an ester. The ¹H NMR shows two -CH₃ signals and, crucially, no -CH₂ signals. An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or any longer-chain ester would contain -CH₂ groups. Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) to avoid any -CH₂ signals. This accounts for one of the two -CH₃ signals observed.\n    *   **Vinyl and Second Methyl Group**: The remaining signals are two vinyl protons (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) and a second -CH₃ group. This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). In this fragment, the vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton and the three methyl protons, resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighboring vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet. The methyl group is split by one vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet. This accounts for the two vinyl signals and the second -CH₃ signal.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nBy combining the identified fragments, we can deduce the structure and its chemical formula:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring**: C₆H₄\n*   **Substituent 1 (Ester)**: -COOCH₃ (which contains C₂H₃O₂)\n*   **Substituent 2 (Vinyl group)**: -CH=CH-CH₃ (which contains C₃H₅)\n\nThe complete structure is Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n### Calculating the Chemical Formula\n\nSumming the atoms from all fragments:\n\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 (from ring) + 2 (from ester) + 3 (from propenyl) = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 (from ring) + 3 (from ester) + 5 (from propenyl) = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (from ester)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula corresponds to the identified structure, which is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the core structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The formula for this part of the molecule is therefore C6H4.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR data:** The spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms, accounting for the \"O2\" part of the chemical formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR data:** This provides the most detailed information about the substituents.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint, eliminating any structures that contain a methylene group.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a simple doublet. This confirms the presence of a –CH=CH–CH3 substituent. This group contains one of the two required –CH3 signals.\n    *   **Finding the second –CH3 group:** The ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl signal can be explained by a methyl ester functional group (–COOCH3). This structure provides the second –CH3 signal and does not contain any –CH2 groups.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, such as para-substitution, where there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons.\n\n4.  **Assemble the structure and determine the formula:**\n    *   The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3) and a methyl ester group (–COOCH3).\n    *   Let's sum the atoms to find the molecular formula:\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the C6H4 ring) + 1 (from the –COO– group) + 1 (from the –OCH3 group) + 3 (from the –CH=CH–CH3 group) = 11 carbons.\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the C6H4 ring) + 3 (from the –OCH3 group) + 4 (from the –CH=CH–CH3 group) = 11 hydrogens. Let's re-count the hydrogens on the propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3 has 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 hydrogens. So, the total hydrogen count is 4 (aromatic) + 3 (ester methyl) + 5 (propenyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify against the options:**\n    *   **C11H12O2:** This matches our derived formula.\n    *   **C11H14O2:** This would require saturating the double bond of the propenyl group to a propyl group (–CH2CH2CH3), which would introduce –CH2 signals, contradicting the NMR data.\n    *   **C12H12O2 and C12H14O2:** These formulas would require adding more carbons and hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the clear interpretation of the NMR signals that perfectly account for a C11H12O2 structure without any –CH2 groups.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic information, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This is a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents, giving a C6H4 core.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates an \"ester group\". An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and one C-O single bond. This adds -COO- to our molecular fragments, which consists of 1 Carbon and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:** The NMR spectrum gives the most detailed clues about the structure.\n    *   **Six signals total:** This tells us there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals suggests a high degree of symmetry. This is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substitution pattern**. In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents (X-C6H4-Y), the four protons form an AA'BB' system, which typically resolves into two signals (often two doublets). This accounts for the C6H4 part of the structure.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(b) is split by both H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is only split by the adjacent H(b), resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This perfectly matches the description and confirms the presence of a -CH=CH-CH3 group.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) we just identified. This methyl group is coupled to a vinyl proton, so its signal would be a doublet.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must come from the other part of the molecule. Since we have an ester group and no other place for a methyl group (as there are no -CH2- groups), it must be part of the ester. This could be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH3). In either case, this methyl group is not adjacent to any protons, so its signal would be a singlet.\n        *   This accounts for two distinct -CH3 signals.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out the presence of groups like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), etc.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure and Determine the Formula:**\n    Based on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n    *   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n    *   A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n    *   An ester group that incorporates a methyl group.\n\n    There are two plausible ways to connect these fragments:\n    *   **Possibility A: Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**\n        The propenyl group and the methyl ester group are attached to the benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions.\n        Structure: CH3-CH=CH–C6H4–COOCH3\n    *   **Possibility B: 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate**\n        The propenyl group and the acetate group are attached to the benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions.\n        Structure: CH3-CH=CH–C6H4–OOCCH3\n\n    Now, let's determine the molecular formula for these structures.\n    *   **For both structures:**\n        *   Benzene ring (C6H4): 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n        *   Propenyl group (C3H5): 3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens\n        *   Ester part (COO) + Methyl part (CH3): 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n    *   **Total Count:**\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated formula is C11H12O2. Let's compare this with the options provided:\n    A) C12H12O2\n    B) C11H14O2\n    C) C11H12O2\n    D) C12H14O2\n\n    Our derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\n    Let's quickly check why the other options are incorrect:\n    *   **C11H14O2:** Compared to C11H12O2, this formula has two extra hydrogens. This would imply the absence of the C=C double bond in the propenyl group (making it a propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3). A propyl group contains -CH2- signals, which are explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n    *   **C12H14O2:** This formula has an extra CH2 group compared to our derived C11H12O2. Again, this is ruled out by the absence of -CH2- signals.\n    *   **C12H12O2:** This formula has an extra carbon atom compared to C11H12O2. It is not possible to add another carbon atom to the proposed structure without either introducing a -CH2- group or violating the other NMR signal constraints.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that perfectly fits all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aromatic Ring Information:**\n    *   The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens with two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons is a strong indication of para (1,4) substitution. This high degree of symmetry makes pairs of protons chemically equivalent, simplifying the spectrum to two signals (typically two doublets). This C6H4 fragment accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Group Information:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows the presence of an **ester group**. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms. This accounts for the O2 part of all the proposed chemical formulas.\n    *   The ester group also contains a carbonyl (C=O) bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Signals for the Substituents:**\n    *   **Vinyl Protons:** There are \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H\". This means there is a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) with a hydrogen attached to each carbon. The signals are described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\".\n        *   A **doublet** means a proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   A **doublet of quartets (dq)** means a proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving the doublet splitting) and a set of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet splitting).\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c).\n            *   Proton H(b) is coupled to H(a), so its signal would be a doublet.\n            *   Proton H(a) is coupled to H(b) (giving a doublet) and the three H(c) protons (giving a quartet). Its signal would be a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This perfectly matches the description. So, one of the substituents on the ring is a propenyl group. This group has the formula -C3H5 and accounts for the two vinyl-H signals and one of the -CH3 signals.\n\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\".\n        *   We have already identified one -CH3 group as part of the propenyl substituent.\n        *   The second -CH3 group must be part of the other substituent, which we know is an ester.\n\n    *   **Absence of -CH2 Groups:** The spectrum has \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\". This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates possibilities like ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) or longer alkyl chains.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Pieces and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a **para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4)**.\n    *   One substituent is a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**, which has a formula of C3H5.\n    *   The other substituent is an ester that contains a methyl group. The only way to form this without a -CH2- group is to have a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate ester (-OOCCH3)**. Both of these fragments have the formula C2H3O2.\n    *   Let's combine these fragments to build the whole molecule. A plausible structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n    *   Now, let's sum the atoms to find the total chemical formula:\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 2 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **11 Carbons**\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **12 Hydrogens**\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   The formula for DBE is: C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   For C11H12O2, DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Our proposed structure has:\n        *   1 aromatic ring (4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds)\n        *   1 C=C double bond in the propenyl group (1 degree of unsaturation)\n        *   1 C=O double bond in the ester group (1 degree of unsaturation)\n    *   Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. The calculated DBE matches the structure, confirming its validity.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The deduced formula C11H12O2 matches option C. The other formulas are inconsistent with the spectroscopic data. For instance, C11H14O2 would have a DBE of 5, and C12 formulas would require an additional carbon atom, which cannot be accommodated without violating the NMR data constraints (e.g., by adding a CH2 group).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Structure Information:**\n    *   **Core:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens. The core of the molecule is therefore a **C6H4** group.\n    *   **FTIR:** The spectrum shows an **ester group** (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms present in all the formula options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Signals to Identify the Substituents:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as only two signals indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para) arrangement.\n    *   **Vinyl-H and one -CH3 group:** The spectrum shows two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) along with one of the -CH3 signals. This is a classic splitting pattern for a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3). This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Second -CH3 group:** The spectrum shows a second, distinct -CH3 signal. Since we know from the FTIR that there is an ester, this methyl group must be part of that ester functionality (e.g., a methyl ester, -COOCH3, or an acetate ester, -OCOCH3). This fragment contributes **C2H3O2** to the overall formula.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of negative evidence. It confirms we do not have any ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains containing a -CH2- unit.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Formula:**\n    *   Add the atoms from each identified piece:\n        *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n        *   Propenyl group: C3H5\n        *   Ester fragment: C2H3O2\n    *   **Total Formula:** C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O2 = **C11H12O2**\n\n4.  **Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (double/triple) bonds.\n    *   **DoU from the deduced structure:** Benzene ring (4) + C=C double bond (1) + C=O double bond (1) = **6**.\n    *   **DoU from the calculated formula (C11H12O2):** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n    *   The DoU values match, confirming that C11H12O2 is the correct formula.\n\n5.  **Eliminate the Other Options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DoU = 5. Incorrect. This formula lacks the C=C double bond required by the vinyl-H signals.\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 6. Incorrect. This formula is equivalent to C11H12O2 + a CH2 group. The NMR data explicitly states there are **no -CH2- groups**.\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 7. Incorrect. This would require an extra ring or double bond not supported by the data.\n\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on the analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, we can deduce the structure and molecular formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The 1H NMR shows two signals for aromatic protons, which is characteristic of a 1,4- (para) substituted benzene ring. This fragment accounts for **C6H4**.\n\n2.  **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This adds **2 oxygen atoms** and a carbonyl group (C=O) to the structure.\n\n3.  **Vinyl Group:** The 1H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This specific splitting pattern is indicative of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**. This fragment contains **C3H5** and a C=C double bond.\n\n4.  **Methyl Groups:** The 1H NMR shows two -CH3 signals.\n    *   One -CH3 group is part of the propenyl group identified above.\n    *   The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester. Since there are no -CH2- signals, it cannot be an ethyl ester. It must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3). In either case, this part of the molecule contributes **C1H3**.\n\n5.  **Assembling the Fragments:** Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 1 (from ester carbonyl C) + 1 (from ester methyl C) = **11 Carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from ester methyl H) = **12 Hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n\n6.  **Molecular Formula:** The assembled structure gives a molecular formula of **C11H12O2**.\n\n7.  **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   From the structure: 1 ring (DBE=1) + 3 double bonds in the ring (DBE=3) + 1 C=C double bond (DBE=1) + 1 C=O double bond (DBE=1) = **Total DBE of 6**.\n    *   From the formula C11H12O2: DBE = C - H/2 + 1 = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**.\n    *   The DBE matches, confirming the formula is correct.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, C11H12O2 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is determined by systematically analyzing its constituent parts.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Proton (¹H) Count:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H:** The prompt describes a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two signals for aromatic protons. This pattern, often an AA'BB' system, is characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring, which has a total of 4 aromatic protons.\n    *   **Vinyl-H:** There are two signals for vinyl protons—one doublet and one doublet of quartets. This splitting pattern is indicative of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). This group contains 2 vinyl protons.\n    *   **Methyl (-CH₃) Groups:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl groups. One signal corresponds to the methyl group of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH₃`) substituent. The other methyl signal must belong to the ester group, as no other structural source is suggested. Since the problem states there are no methylene (`-CH₂`) groups, this methyl must be directly attached to the ester functionality (i.e., a methyl ester or an acetyl group). Each methyl group contributes 3 protons, for a total of 6 protons from these two groups.\n    *   **Total Protons:** Summing these up gives a total of 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = 12 protons.\n\n2.  **Carbon Count:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted benzene ring contributes 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** The `-CH=CH-CH₃` group adds 3 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester (`-COO-`). The NMR data indicates a methyl group is part of this functionality, with no adjacent `-CH₂` groups. This leads to two possibilities for the ester substituent: a methoxycarbonyl group (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). Both of these groups contain 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Total Carbons:** The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester) = 11 carbons.\n\n3.  **Oxygen Count:**\n    *   The ester functional group (`-COO-`) contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the counts for each element, the molecular formula is determined to be **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic information. Compounds such as (E)-methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate and 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate are isomers that fit this formula and the spectral data described.\n\nThis eliminates the other options:\n*   `C₁₂H₁₂O₂`: Incorrect carbon count.\n*   `C₁₂H₁₄O₂`: Incorrect carbon and hydrogen counts, and would likely contain `-CH₂` groups, which are explicitly absent.\n*   `C₁₁H₁₄O₂`: Incorrect hydrogen count and would imply a saturated alkyl chain instead of a propenyl group, contradicting the vinyl-H signals.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a C₆H₄ group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the chemical formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed clues about the attached groups.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint, eliminating any structures with ethyl, propyl, or other similar alkyl chains.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** This means there are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃).\n        *   The proton on the middle carbon is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The proton on the terminal carbon (attached to the ring) is split only by the adjacent vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   This confirms one of the substituents is a propenyl group (–C₃H₅), which also accounts for one of the two –CH₃ signals.\n    *   **Assembling the second substituent:** We still need to place the ester group (–COO–) and the second –CH₃ group. The only way to do this without creating a –CH₂– group is to form a methyl ester (–COOCH₃). This accounts for the second –CH₃ signal.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two different groups, such as a propenyl group and a methyl ester group, would show distinct signals for the aromatic protons, consistent with the \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" description (likely an AA'BB' system if para-substituted).\n\n4.  **Construct the Molecule and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring: C₆H₄\n    *   We have a propenyl group: –CH=CH–CH₃ (which is C₃H₅)\n    *   We have a methyl ester group: –COOCH₃ (which is C₂H₃O₂)\n\n    Now, let's add up the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** **2** (from ester)\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Other Options:**\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This would require saturating the double bond of the propenyl group to a propyl group (–CH₂CH₂CH₃), which would introduce –CH₂– signals, contradicting the NMR data.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** Adding another carbon or a carbon and two hydrogens without introducing a –CH₂– group and while keeping the other NMR-defined fragments is not feasible. For instance, adding a CH₂ group is explicitly ruled out.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only possible formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group, which has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is consistent with a di-substituted benzene ring, particularly a para-substituted one where the two substituents are different.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** The absence of signals for –CH2 groups is a critical constraint, eliminating many possible structures.\n    *   **Two –CH3 groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** The signals for a doublet and a doublet of quartets are characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl hydrogen, resulting in a doublet. The second vinyl hydrogen is split by the first vinyl hydrogen (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet), which results in a doublet of quartets. The methyl group of this substituent would appear as a doublet, accounting for one of the two –CH3 signals.\n    *   **The second –CH3 group:** This methyl group must be part of the ester. Since there are no –CH2 groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH2CH3). Therefore, it must be a methyl ester (–COOCH3). This accounts for the second –CH3 signal, which would appear as a singlet.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    Based on the analysis, the molecule consists of:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n    *   A propenyl group (–CH=CHCH3).\n    *   A methyl ester group (–COOCH3).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Chemical Formula:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the benzene ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from the methyl ester group) = 11 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the benzene ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group: 1+1+3) + 3 (from the methyl ester group) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    The degree of unsaturation for C11H12O2 is calculated as:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    This matches the structural features: 4 for the aromatic ring, 1 for the vinyl C=C double bond, and 1 for the ester C=O double bond.\n\nComparing this calculated formula to the given options:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
