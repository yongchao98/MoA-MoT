    "The question assumes a uniform distribution of stars in space and asks how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value itself. Here's a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Parallax and Distance:** Stellar parallax (`plx` or π) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. This relationship can be expressed as `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Volume and Star Count:** Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space with a constant density (ρ), the total number of stars (`N`) within a certain distance `d` is proportional to the volume (`V`) of a sphere with radius `d`.\n    *   `V = (4/3)πd³`\n    *   `N(d) = ρ * V = (4/3)πρd³`\n\n3.  **Star Count as a Function of Parallax:** By substituting the distance `d` with `1/plx`, we can express the number of stars as a function of parallax. This function, `N(plx)`, represents the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx`.\n    *   `N(plx) = (4/3)πρ(1/plx)³ = (4/3)πρ / plx³`\n\n4.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax Range:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the density of stars with respect to parallax. This requires finding the derivative of `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`, which tells us how the number of stars changes for an infinitesimally small change in parallax.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³ ]`\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = -4πρ * plx⁻⁴`\n\n5.  **Interpreting the Result:** The magnitude of this derivative gives the distribution or the number of stars per unit parallax interval.\n    *   `|dN/d(plx)| ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis means that the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to the inverse of the parallax to the fourth power. This result is a known element in astronomical statistics, particularly in discussions of biases like the Lutz-Kelker bias. An academic paper from the *Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society* confirms that assuming a uniform distribution of stars in space, the number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to 1/π⁴ (where π represents parallax). Another source from the *Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific* reiterates that \"the number of stars per unit interval of parallax varies as l/π⁴\".\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<D>>>"
