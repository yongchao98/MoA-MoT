    "**Analysis of the Reactions:**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction. The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbon of the ketone's carbonyl group. The resulting intermediate, an alkoxide, is then protonated to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH). This protonation step is typically carried out by an acid during a workup step. Therefore, `A` represents an acid source like H₃O⁺. Reagent `NaHSO₃` is used for forming bisulfite addition products and is not correct for this transformation.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be catalyzed by either acid or base. The direct formation of the carboxylic acid (as opposed to its salt) is characteristic of acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Strong acids like hydrochloric acid (HCl) are typically heated with the nitrile to ensure the reaction goes to completion. A weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is generally not sufficient for this hydrolysis. Therefore, `B` is a strong acid like HCl.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, reagent A is H₃O⁺ and reagent B is HCl. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
