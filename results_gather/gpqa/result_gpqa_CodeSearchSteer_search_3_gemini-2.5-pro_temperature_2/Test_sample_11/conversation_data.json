    "The calculation for the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) is based on the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is: π⁺ → μ⁺ + νμ\n\nGiven the rest masses:\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (mπ): 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (mμ): 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (νμ) is considered to have negligible mass.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy. This energy must be conserved and is converted into the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    *   E(π⁺) = E(μ⁺) + E(ν)\n    *   m(π⁺)c² = (K(μ⁺) + m(μ⁺)c²) + K(ν)\n    *   139.6 MeV = K(μ⁺) + 105.7 MeV + K(ν)\n    *   This gives the total kinetic energy of the products: K(μ⁺) + K(ν) = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: The initial momentum is zero because the pion is stationary. Therefore, the muon and neutrino must be emitted in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.\n    *   p(μ⁺) = p(ν) = p\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**: The relationship E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)² is used to find the energies.\n    *   For the massless neutrino, the energy is E(ν) = pc. Since its rest mass is zero, its kinetic energy K(ν) equals its total energy. Thus, K(ν) = pc.\n    *   For the muon: (K(μ⁺) + m(μ⁺)c²)² = (pc)² + (m(μ⁺)c²)².\n\n4.  **Solving for Kinetic Energies**: By substituting `pc` with `K(ν)` and then expressing `K(ν)` in terms of `K(μ⁺)`, we can solve for the kinetic energy of the muon.\n    *   pc = [ (m(π)c²)² - (m(μ)c²)² ] / [ 2 * m(π)c² ]\n    *   pc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ] MeV\n    *   pc ≈ [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / 279.2 MeV\n    *   pc ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n    This momentum value corresponds to the kinetic energy of the neutrino:\n    *   K(ν) ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\n    The kinetic energy of the muon is then found by:\n    *   K(μ⁺) = 33.9 MeV - K(ν)\n    *   K(μ⁺) ≈ 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energies of the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν) are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This aligns with experimentally measured values for the kinetic energy of the muon in this decay.\n\n<<<D>>>"
