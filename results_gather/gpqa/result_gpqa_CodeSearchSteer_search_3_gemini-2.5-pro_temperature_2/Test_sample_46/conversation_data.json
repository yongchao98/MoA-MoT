    "The provided data for the unknown compound C9H11NO2 is as follows:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **IR Spectrum:** Medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹, and a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** 1.20 ppm (t, 3H); 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); 4.5 ppm (q, 2H); 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H).\n\nLet's analyze the data step-by-step to identify the correct structure.\n\n**1. Degree of Unsaturation:**\nThe formula for the degree of unsaturation is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\nFor C9H11NO2, this is 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\nA degree of unsaturation of 5 typically indicates a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (like a C=O bond).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹** and **3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the carbonyl region and is indicative of a C=O stretch. The position suggests an ester, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring, which lowers the frequency from the typical ~1740 cm⁻¹.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: This triplet, integrating to three protons, indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This quartet, integrating to two protons, indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The high chemical shift (deshielding) suggests this -CH₂ group is attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is a classic signature for an **ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and potential hydrogen exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group). The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group, -COOR).\n\n**4. Structure Assembly and Evaluation of Options:**\nBased on the analysis, the compound contains:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring to which these two groups are attached.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this against the options:\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR. It would also show a signal for a formyl proton (-CHO) in the NMR.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: C9H11NO2 formula, primary amine, conjugated ester, ethyl group, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, but its carbonyl stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹). Also, a 1,3- (meta) substitution would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure is an isomer, but the alkyl portion is a propionate group attached to the phenolic oxygen (-O-CO-CH₂CH₃). The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
