    "This is a classic problem in electrostatics that demonstrates the principle of electrostatic shielding.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning to find the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When the positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity, it attracts the free electrons within the spherical conductor. A total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: for the electric field to be zero within the material of the conductor, any Gaussian surface drawn inside the conductor must enclose a net charge of zero.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor effectively isolates the outside from what is happening inside the cavity. The arrangement of the charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the inner wall creates a combined electric field that is zero everywhere outside the cavity. This means the charges inside the conductor (the original `+q` and the induced `-q`) have no direct effect on the electric field at point P.\n\n4.  **Uniform Distribution:** The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface is not influenced by the position of the charge inside the cavity due to the shielding effect. Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the surface to be in electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside:** According to the shell theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point P outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated at its center. In this case, we have a charge of `+q` uniformly distributed on the outer sphere of radius `R`.\n\nTherefore, the electric field at point P, at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor, is equivalent to the field from a point charge `+q` located at the conductor's center. The magnitude is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe information about the cavity's radius `r`, its distance `s` from the center, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸` are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding and charge redistribution principles.\n\n<<<A>>>"
