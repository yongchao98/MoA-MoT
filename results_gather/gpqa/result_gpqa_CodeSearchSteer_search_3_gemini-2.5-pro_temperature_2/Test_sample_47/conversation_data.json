    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\nWhen an α-halo ketone like 2-bromocyclohexanone is treated with a strong base such as sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a ring-contracting rearrangement known as the Favorskii rearrangement. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring contracts to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (after neutralization of the initially formed sodium salt).\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\nCyclopentanecarboxylic acid reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) in a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride. Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\nCyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is an acyl chloride. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent that selectively reduces reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, and the reaction stops at this stage.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must examine the symmetry of the cyclopentanecarbaldehyde molecule. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the aldehyde group (CHO), the C-H bond on the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is unique. (1 type)\n2.  **Alpha Hydrogen (on C1):** The hydrogen on the carbon atom directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **Beta Hydrogens (on C2 and C5):** The two carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5) are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic (one is *cis* to the aldehyde group, one is *trans*). Therefore, the two *cis* hydrogens (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* hydrogens are equivalent to each other, giving two distinct types of hydrogens at these positions. (2 types)\n4.  **Gamma Hydrogens (on C3 and C4):** Similarly, the next two carbons (C3 and C4) are equivalent by symmetry. The two hydrogens on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in two more distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nIn total, the number of chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms is: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (alpha) + 2 (beta) + 2 (gamma) = **6**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
