    "High-energy (ultraviolet) divergences are a common problem in quantum field theories, requiring a mathematical procedure called regularization to yield finite, meaningful results. This process is necessary for theories that describe particles as mathematical points, as the interactions can become infinite at zero distance.\n\n*   **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)** and **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)** are both quantum field theories that describe fundamental forces (the strong and electromagnetic forces, respectively). Both theories are known to have calculations that result in infinities, which arise from loop diagrams representing virtual particles at very high energies (or, equivalently, very short distances). To handle these infinities and make physical predictions, a process of regularization, followed by renormalization, is required.\n\n*   **Classical Electrodynamics**, while not a quantum field theory, faces its own problem with infinities, such as the infinite self-energy of a point-like charged particle. While methods exist to handle these issues, which can be seen as a form of regularization, the concept of regularization \"at high energies\" specifically refers to the ultraviolet divergences that appear in the quantum loop calculations of quantum field theory.\n\n*   **Superstring Theory** is a theoretical framework that aims to unify all fundamental forces, including gravity. A key feature of superstring theory is that it is believed to be free from the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences that plague quantum field theories. Instead of point particles, the fundamental entities in superstring theory are one-dimensional \"strings.\" This extended nature of strings smooths out interactions at very short distances, thus avoiding the infinities. Consequently, superstring theory is considered to be a UV-finite theory that does not require regularization for high-energy effects.\n\nTherefore, out of the given options, superstring theory is the one that is believed to not require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<D>>>"
