    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle**: The problem involves uncertainties in position and energy, which points to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n2.  **Determine the uncertainty in momentum (Δp)**: The position-momentum uncertainty principle states ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2. We are given the uncertainty in the electron's position (Δx) and can use this to find the minimum uncertainty in its momentum (Δp).\n3.  **Relate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE)**: Since the electron is traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s), we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)². By differentiating this equation, we can find a relationship between a change in momentum and the corresponding change in energy.\n4.  **Calculate the final value**: Substitute the known values into the derived equations to find ΔE.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp)**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives the minimum uncertainty relationship as:\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\nGiven:\n*   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Reduced Planck's constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nSubstituting the values:\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp = 0.527 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**Step 2: Relate ΔE to Δp for a relativistic particle**\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum equation is E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)².\nTo find the relationship between small changes in E and p, we differentiate E with respect to p:\ndE/dp = v\nFor small uncertainties, we can approximate this as:\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the electron (v) = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE)**\n\nNow, substitute the values of v and Δp into the relation:\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (0.527 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThis value is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThe calculated value aligns with option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
