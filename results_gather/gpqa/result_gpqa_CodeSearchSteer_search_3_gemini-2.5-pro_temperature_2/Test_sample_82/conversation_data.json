    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both 25% titration and the equivalence point.\n\n### 1. Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial Concentration of Acetic Acid (C₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume of Acetic Acid (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration of Acetic Acid (C₂):**\n    C₂ = (C₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate. The solution at this point contains a mixture of the weak acid and its conjugate base, forming a buffer. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** pH = pKa + log (\\[A⁻]/\\[HA])\n    Where:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka)\n    *   \\[A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate).\n    *   \\[HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n*   **Determine the ratio of \\[A⁻] to \\[HA]:**\n    At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to the conjugate base \\[A⁻], and 75% remains as the acid \\[HA].\n    The ratio \\[A⁻]/\\[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    **pH ≈ 4.25**\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The resulting solution contains only the conjugate base, which hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Calculate Moles of Acetic Acid:**\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 moles\n\n*   **Calculate Volume of NaOH at Equivalence Point:**\n    Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 moles.\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Calculate Concentration of Acetate (A⁻) at Equivalence Point:**\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    Concentration of \\[A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n*   **Calculate Kb for the Acetate Ion:**\n    The acetate ion (A⁻) hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   **Calculate Hydroxide Ion Concentration \\[OH⁻]:**\n    Using the Kb expression: Kb = \\[[CH₃COOH]\\[OH⁻]] / \\[CH₃COO⁻] = x² / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = \\[OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log(\\[OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nBased on the calculations, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26 (rounding 4.25), and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<B>>>"
