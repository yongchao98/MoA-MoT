    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the uncertainty in their energies. This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe relationship between a quantum state's lifetime (τ or Δt) and the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), also known as its natural linewidth, is given by the formula:\n\nΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). A shorter lifetime leads to a broader, more uncertain energy level, while a longer lifetime results in a narrower, more defined energy level.\n\nWe are given two quantum states with the following lifetimes:\n*   State 1: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   State 2: τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty, or natural linewidth, for each state:\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo resolve or clearly distinguish the two energy levels, their energy separation must be larger than their combined linewidths, or at the very least, larger than the broader of the two linewidths. State 1 has the shorter lifetime and therefore the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV). This broader width is the dominant factor for distinguishability.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference between the two levels, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly greater than ~10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n\nComparing these options with our calculated minimum requirement:\n*   10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   10⁻⁹ eV is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   10⁻¹¹ eV is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy difference large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<A>>>"
