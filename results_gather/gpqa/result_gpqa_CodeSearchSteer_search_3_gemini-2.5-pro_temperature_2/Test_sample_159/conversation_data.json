    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Aperture**: The problem describes an N-sided polygonal aperture where N is infinitely large. A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides converges to a circle. The apothem 'a' is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. As N approaches infinity, the apothem becomes the radius of the circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Diffraction by a Circular Aperture**: When monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a characteristic far-field diffraction pattern known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\n3.  **Condition for Intensity Minima**: The intensity of the diffraction pattern is zero when the argument of the Bessel function, J₁(k·a·sinθ), corresponds to a zero of the function (excluding the origin which is the central maximum). Here, 'k' is the wave number (k = 2π/λ), 'a' is the radius of the aperture, and 'θ' is the angular position of the minimum.\n    The condition for the n-th minimum is:\n    k * a * sin(θn) = zₙ\n    Where zₙ is the n-th positive zero of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\n4.  **Applying Small Angle Approximation**: The problem states that the related angles are small, so we can use the approximation sin(θ) ≈ θ.\n    The condition becomes:\n    (2π/λ) * a * θₙ = zₙ\n    Solving for the angular position θₙ:\n    θₙ = (zₙ * λ) / (2π * a)\n\n5.  **Finding the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima**:\n    *   The first minimum (θ₁) corresponds to the first zero of J₁(x), which is z₁ ≈ 3.8317.\n    *   The second minimum (θ₂) corresponds to the second zero of J₁(x), which is z₂ ≈ 7.0156.\n    The angular position of the first minimum is:\n    θ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ/a\n    The angular position of the second minimum is:\n    θ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ/a\n\n6.  **Calculating the Angular Distance**: The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1166 * λ/a) - (0.6098 * λ/a)\n    Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ/a)\n    Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * λ/a\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: The calculated angular distance is approximately 0.5068 λ/a. Comparing this result with the given options, it closely matches option C. The locations of the minima for a circular aperture are well-established, with some sources providing the values directly as multiples of λ/D, where D is the diameter (D=2a). For example, the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/D = 0.61 λ/a, and the second is at 2.23 λ/D = 1.115 λ/a. The difference is (1.115 - 0.61) λ/a = 0.505 λ/a, which again confirms the result.\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<C>>>"
