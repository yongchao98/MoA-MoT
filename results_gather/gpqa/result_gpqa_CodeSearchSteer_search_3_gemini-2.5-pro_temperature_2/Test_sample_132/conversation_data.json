    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻), a multi-step calculation is required based on the principles of chemical equilibrium for a buffer solution.\n\nFirst, the molar concentrations of the primary buffer components, dihydrogen phosphate (H₂PO₄⁻) and hydrogen phosphate (HPO₄²⁻), must be calculated.\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n\nNext, calculate the initial molar concentrations of these ions in the 200.00 cm³ (0.20000 L) solution.\n\n*   **Concentration of [H₂PO₄⁻]:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n*   **Concentration of [HPO₄²⁻]:**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\nThe solution is a buffer system composed of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). The pH of this buffer is governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka₂.\n\n*   **Equilibrium for the buffer:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   **Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸**\n\nFrom the Ka₂ expression, we can calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:\n\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻), which is described by the third dissociation constant, Ka₃.\n\n*   **Equilibrium for orthophosphate formation:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   **Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²**\n\nThe concentration of the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] can be found by rearranging the Ka₃ expression:\n\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nNow, substitute the previously calculated values for [HPO₄²⁻] and [H⁺]:\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThus, the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
