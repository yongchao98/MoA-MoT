    "### Analysis of the Reaction Products and Chromatographic Peaks\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reactions and the resulting analysis by HPLC:\n\n#### **Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces the ketone at the third carbon to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Products:** The starting material has one chiral center at carbon 5 with a defined (S) configuration. The reduction of the prochiral ketone at carbon 3 creates a new chiral center. This results in the formation of two products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers, as one chiral center is the same (5S) while the other is different (3S vs. 3R).\n\n#### **Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBHâ‚„) reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of pentane-2,4-dione results in pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule has two new chiral centers at carbons 2 and 4. Three stereoisomers are possible:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers.\n*   The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, which is achiral. This meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture that is analyzed contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### HPLC Analysis\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in polarity; it does not resolve enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Since diastereomers have different physical properties, they will be separated, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The product mixture consists of an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The enantiomers will not be separated and will elute as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them, resulting in a second peak. Therefore, the products of Reaction II will show **two peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n#### **Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC**\n\nA chiral stationary phase HPLC is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate any compounds that are structurally different, including diastereomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomeric alcohols will be separated, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers into two distinct peaks. The achiral meso compound will elute as a single, separate peak. This results in a total of **three peaks** from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined product mixture will show **5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
