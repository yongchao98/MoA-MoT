    "To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The relative velocity (v) between the ejecta's frame and the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time that has passed in the ejecta's reference frame (the proper time, Δt') is 50 seconds.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\n    According to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure a longer time interval for events occurring in a moving frame. This phenomenon is called time dilation and is described by the formula:\n\n    Δt = γ * Δt'\n\n    Where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n    First, let's calculate the ratio v/c:\n    v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\n    Next, we calculate v²/c²:\n    (v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04\n\n    Now, we can find the Lorentz factor (γ):\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)\n\n    Using a calculator, √(0.96) ≈ 0.9798.\n    So, γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206\n\n    Now, we can calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):\n    Δt = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s\n\n3.  **Calculate the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n    The distance (d) is the velocity (v) multiplied by the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).\n\n    d = v * Δt\n    d = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / √(0.96))\n    d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)\n    d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798\n    d ≈ 3,061,860 km\n\n    Looking at the options provided, the closest value is 3,060,000 km. The small difference is due to rounding during the calculation. The exact result is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n\n    Therefore, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>"
