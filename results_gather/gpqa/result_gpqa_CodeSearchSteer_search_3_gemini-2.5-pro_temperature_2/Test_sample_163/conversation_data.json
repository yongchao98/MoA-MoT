    "The initial analysis of the problem seems correct. The derived formula, which relates the total mass of a binary system to its orbital period and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes, is consistent with the fundamental principles of astrophysics found in the search results. Specifically, the relationship `M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³` is the key to solving the problem. The fact that the systems are eclipsing binaries allows for the crucial simplification that the orbital inclination `i` is close to 90 degrees, making `sin(i)` approximately 1. This means the `sin³(i)` term in the full mass equation can be considered equal for both systems and thus cancels out when taking the ratio.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Identify the relationship between mass, period, and velocity.**\n\nFrom Kepler's Third Law and the definition of radial velocity, the total mass (M_total = m₁ + m₂) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary can be expressed as:\n`M_total = [P / (2πG)] * [(K₁ + K₂ )³ / sin³(i)]`\nwhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K₁` and `K₂` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination (the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky).\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince both systems are described as exhibiting eclipses, it is reasonable to assume their orbital planes are viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90° for both. Therefore, `sin(i)` is approximately 1, and this term can be neglected when comparing the two systems.\n\n**2. State the proportional relationship and the data for each system.**\n\nThe total mass is therefore proportional to the period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n`M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂ )³`\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total₁) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total₂) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n**3. Calculate the ratio of the masses.**\n\nTo find out by what factor system 1 is more massive than system 2, we compute the ratio M₁ / M₂:\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K_total₁)³] / [P₂ * (K_total₂)³]`\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]`\n\nThe units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) are consistent between the two systems, so they will cancel out, leaving a dimensionless factor.\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\nThe result 0.432 is approximately 0.4. This means system 1 has about 0.4 times the mass of system 2; in other words, it is less massive.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.4\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe calculated factor of 0.432 is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
