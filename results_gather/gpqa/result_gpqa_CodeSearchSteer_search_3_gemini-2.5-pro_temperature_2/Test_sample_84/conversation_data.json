    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n**1. Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_eff_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nwhere:\n*   `T_eff_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**2. Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff_star * (1 - A_p1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_eff_star * (1 - A_p2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so `T_eff_star` and `R_star` are the same for both. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo (`A_p1` = `A_p2`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observables**\n\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The observed Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines is caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nwhere:\n*   `M_p` is the mass of the planet.\n*   `M_star` is the mass of the star.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n(This formula assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass and the orbital inclination is close to 90 degrees, which is a reasonable assumption since the planets were also detected via the transit method).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\na = G * M_p² / (K² * M_star)\n\n**4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n\na2 / a1 = [G * M_p2² / (K2² * M_star)] / [G * M_p1² / (K1² * M_star)]\n\nThe terms `G` and `M_star` are constant and cancel out, leaving:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n**5. Substituting the Given Values**\n\n*   **Mass Ratio:**\n    *   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   (M_p2 / M_p1) = 5 / 7\n\n*   **Radial Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K):**\n    The radial velocity `v` is related to the Doppler shift `Δλ` by `Δλ / λ = v / c`. The amplitude `K` is the maximum velocity, so it is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift.\n    *   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n    *   (K1 / K2) = (Δλ1 / Δλ2) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow substitute these ratios back into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**6. Final Calculation of Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, we substitute the value of `a2 / a1` into the simplified temperature ratio formula:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
