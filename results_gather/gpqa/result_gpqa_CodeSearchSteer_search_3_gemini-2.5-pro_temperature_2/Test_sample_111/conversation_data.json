    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector |α⟩\n\nThe given state is proportional to `(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩`. Let's call the unnormalized state `|α'⟩`:\n`|α'⟩ = (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩`\n\nIn matrix form, `|up⟩` corresponds to `[1, 0]` and `|down⟩` corresponds to `[0, 1]`. So, the vector representation is:\n`|α'⟩ = [1+i, 2-i]`\n\nTo normalize this state, we must ensure that `⟨α|α⟩ = 1`. The inner product `⟨α'|α'⟩` is calculated as:\n`⟨α'|α'⟩ = |1+i|² + |2-i|²`\n`|1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2`\n`|2-i|² = 2² + (-1)² = 4 + 1 = 5`\n`⟨α'|α'⟩ = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant `C` is `1/sqrt(⟨α'|α'⟩) = 1/√7`.\nTherefore, the normalized state `|α⟩` is:\n`|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]`\n\n### 2. Define the Operator A and Find its Eigenstates and Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator A is given by the matrix elements `Aij = ħ/2` if `i ≠ j` and `Aij = 0` otherwise. For a 2-state system, this gives the matrix:\n`A = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ ]] ) = (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\n`λ₁ = +ħ/2`\n`λ₂ = -ħ/2`\n\nNext, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors (eigenstates).\n\n**For λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n`(A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0`\n`[[ -ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2 ]] * [a, b] = [0, 0]`\nThis leads to the equation `- (ħ/2)a + (ħ/2)b = 0`, which simplifies to `a = b`.\nThe unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]`. Normalizing it gives:\n`|v₁⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 1] = (1/√2) * (|up⟩ + |down⟩)`\n\n**For λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n`(A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0`\n`[[ ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, ħ/2 ]] * [a, b] = [0, 0]`\nThis leads to the equation `(ħ/2)a + (ħ/2)b = 0`, which simplifies to `a = -b`.\nThe unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]`. Normalizing it gives:\n`|v₂⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, -1] = (1/√2) * (|up⟩ - |down⟩)`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|vᵢ⟩` is given by `P(λᵢ) = |⟨vᵢ|α⟩|²`.\n\n**Probability for λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n`⟨v₁|α⟩ = [(1/√2) * (⟨up| + ⟨down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩)]`\n`⟨v₁|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [(1+i) + (2-i)] = 3/√14`\n`P(λ₁) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n**Probability for λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n`⟨v₂|α⟩ = [(1/√2) * (⟨up| - ⟨down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩)]`\n`⟨v₂|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [(1+i) - (2-i)] = (1/√14) * (-1 + 2i)`\n`P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe two probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Find the Average (Expectation) Value of A\n\nThe average value `⟨A⟩` can be calculated using the formula `⟨A⟩ = Σ P(λᵢ)λᵢ`:\n`⟨A⟩ = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂`\n`⟨A⟩ = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2) * (9/14 - 5/14) = (ħ/2) * (4/14) = (ħ/2) * (2/7) = ħ/7`\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is `ħ/7`. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
