    "When solving differential equations numerically using methods that involve approximating a matrix exponential function, a common and effective technique for parallelization relies on the mathematical properties of that approximation.\n\nThe solution to the system of ordinary differential equations that arises from discretizing the heat equation involves a matrix exponential function. This function is then approximated by a rational function (a fraction of two polynomials), often a Pad√© approximant.\n\nThe key to converting the sequential calculation into a parallel one is the ability to decompose this rational function into a sum of simpler terms through a partial fraction expansion. This decomposition allows the complex problem to be split into a number of smaller, independent linear algebraic systems. These independent systems can then be solved simultaneously on different processors, which is the essence of the parallel algorithm.\n\n*   **A) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions:** This typically complicates a problem and can make parallelization more difficult, not enable it.\n*   **B) Stability analysis:** This is a crucial property of any numerical algorithm, ensuring that errors do not grow uncontrollably, but it does not, by itself, create the opportunity for parallel computation.\n*   **D) Complex roots of fractional approximation:** The nature of the roots (or poles) of the rational function is important for stability and for the partial fraction expansion itself, but it is the decomposition, not the mere existence of complex roots, that is the key enabling factor for parallelization.\n\nTherefore, the crucial step that allows for the \"parallel splitting\" is the decomposition of the fractional approximation into linear partial fractions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
