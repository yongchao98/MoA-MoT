    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases formed from the decomposition of salts A and B is passed through a series of tubes, which allows us to identify the components and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = **0.2 mol H₂O**\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The fact that its weight did not change means no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This means the gas reacting with the copper contained oxygen. The mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol O\n    *   This oxygen came from diatomic oxygen gas (O₂). Therefore, moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = **0.025 mol O₂**\n    *   Alternatively, another possibility is the gas was nitrous oxide (N₂O), which also reacts with hot copper (Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂). This would also result in a mass increase of 0.80 g of oxygen for every 0.05 moles of N₂O. Both possibilities will be considered.\n\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas, which did not react in any of the tubes, amounts to 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.1 mol Gas C**\n    *   This inert gas is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **2. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nFrom the information \"only a mixture of gases was formed,\" it is highly probable that the salts are ammonium compounds, as they can decompose without leaving a solid residue. The products contain nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, pointing towards ammonium salts with nitrogen-oxygen anions. The two most common such salts are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the mixture consists of these two salts.\n\n**Decomposition Reactions:**\nThe thermal decomposition of these salts can follow different pathways depending on the temperature.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** Decomposes to nitrogen and water.\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** At the given temperature of 200°C, it can decompose in two primary ways.\n    *   Path (I): NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   Path (II): 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nWe can determine the correct reaction path by matching the calculated products with the experimental data. Let 'x' be the moles of Salt A and Salt B in the equimolar mixture.\n\n**Scenario A: NH₄NO₃ decomposes via Path (I) to N₂O**\nIf Salt A is NH₄NO₃ and Salt B is NH₄NO₂, and they decompose as follows:\n*   x NH₄NO₃ → x N₂O + 2x H₂O\n*   x NH₄NO₂ → x N₂ + 2x H₂O\n\nThe total products would be:\n*   `n(H₂O)` = 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   The gases entering Tube №3 would be x moles of N₂O and x moles of N₂. The N₂O reacts with copper, increasing the tube's mass by adding x moles of oxygen atoms. The final Gas C would consist of the original x moles of N₂ plus the x moles of N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction.\n*   `n(O)` in Tube 3 = x\n*   `n(Gas C)` = x (original) + x (from N₂O) = 2x\n\nMatching with experimental data:\n*   From H₂O: 4x = 0.2 mol → **x = 0.05 mol**\n*   From Tube 3 (Oxygen): n(O) = x = 0.05 mol → Mass of O = 0.05 mol * 16.00 g/mol = 0.80 g. **This matches.**\n*   From Gas C (Nitrogen): n(N₂) = 2x = 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 mol. **This matches.**\n\nThis scenario perfectly fits the experimental results. Thus, the mixture contains **0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃** and **0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂**.\n\n### **3. Verification of the Initial Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture corresponds to the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of Salt A (NH₄NO₃) = 80.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Salt B (NH₄NO₂) = 64.04 g/mol\n\n*   Mass of A = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.002 g\n*   Mass of B = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g\n*   Total Mass = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = **7.204 g**\n\nThis confirms that our identification of the salts and their quantities is correct.\n\n### **4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃\n    *   Number of atoms = (2 × N) + (4 × H) + (3 × O) = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂\n    *   Number of atoms = (2 × N) + (4 × H) + (2 × O) = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**\n\n**Total number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
