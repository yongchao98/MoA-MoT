    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the energy of a photon that can excite a diatomic molecule from its ground state to the next lowest possible energy state and then determine the photon's momentum.\n\n### 1. Identify the Transition and Calculate its Energy\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + ½) + B∙J(J + 1)\nwhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant.\n\nThe fundamental state, or ground state, is the one with the lowest possible energy, which corresponds to v = 0 and J = 0.\n\nThe \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" requires comparing the energy of the first excited rotational state (v=0, J=1) with the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0).\n*   **Rotational transition energy (ΔE_rot)** from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1) is typically much lower than vibrational transition energy.\n*   **Vibrational transition energy (ΔE_vib)** from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0) is typically much higher.\n\nHowever, we must consider the selection rules for photon absorption by a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, which are Δv = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1. A pure vibrational transition (ΔJ = 0) is forbidden. A pure rotational transition (Δv = 0, ΔJ = +1) is allowed but occurs at much lower energies (microwave region) than rovibrational transitions (infrared region).\n\nGiven the magnitude of the answers, the problem is concerned with a rovibrational transition (a simultaneous change in vibrational and rotational states). For a molecule starting in the ground state (v=0, J=0), the lowest energy-allowed rovibrational transition is to the state (v=1, J=1).\n\nThe energy of this transition (ΔE) is the difference between the final and initial state energies:\n*   E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + ½) + B∙0(0+1) = ½ħω\n*   E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + ½) + B∙1(1+1) = ³⁄₂ħω + 2B\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = (³⁄₂ħω + 2B) - (½ħω) = ħω + 2B\n\nIn many cases, the rotational energy contribution (2B) is very small compared to the vibrational energy (ħω), so we can approximate ΔE ≈ ħω.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Transition Energy\nFirst, we calculate the energy associated with the vibrational frequency `ω`:\n*   ω = 4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   ħ = 1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nΔE ≈ ħω = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) × (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s)\nΔE ≈ 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 3. Calculate the Photon's Momentum\nThe energy (E) of a photon is related to its momentum (p) by the equation E = pc, where `c` is the speed of light (c ≈ 2.998 × 10⁸ m/s). Therefore, the momentum is p = E/c.\n\nUsing the calculated energy change:\np = ΔE / c = (4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.407 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis value is very close to one of the provided options.\n\nFinal check including the rotational constant `B`:\nThe contribution from the rotational part `2B` is several orders of magnitude smaller than `ħω` and does not significantly change the result. For completeness:\n1.  Reduced Mass (μ):\n    μ = (Mx · My) / (Mx + My) = (20 · 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 1.818 amu\n    μ ≈ 1.818 × 1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n2.  Moment of Inertia (I):\n    I = μR² = (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) · (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)² ≈ 1.208 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n3.  Rotational Constant (B):\n    B = ħ² / (2I) ≈ (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴)² / (2 · 1.208 × 10⁻⁴⁶) ≈ 4.6 × 10⁻²³ J\nThe term `2B` is about a thousand times smaller than `ħω`, confirming that the approximation ΔE ≈ ħω is sufficient. The calculated momentum of approximately 1.4 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s holds.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) p = 1.9 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\nB) p = 1.4 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\nC) p = 2.3 × 10⁻²⁷ N·s\nD) p = 1.1 × 10⁻²⁷ N·s\n\nThe calculated value of 1.407 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
