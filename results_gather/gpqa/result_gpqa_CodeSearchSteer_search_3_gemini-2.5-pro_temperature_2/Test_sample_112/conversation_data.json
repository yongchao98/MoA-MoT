    "To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, the data from each characterization technique must be analyzed.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy**:\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids, which typically appears in the range of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. The broad nature of this peak is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, as they show an intense band between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹.\n    *   The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is in the region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which typically occurs between 1620-1680 cm⁻¹. This suggests the compound is unsaturated.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy**:\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond (an alkene) in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry**:\n    *   A fragment peak observed at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic indicator of the carboxylic acid fragment, [COOH]⁺.\n\n### Determining the Chemical Formula:\n\nThe combined spectroscopic data strongly supports the presence of both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n1.  The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options C6H12O (B) and C6H10O (D).\n2.  The remaining options are C6H12O2 (A) and C6H10O2 (C). To differentiate between these, we can calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU). The DoU represents the total number of rings and/or π bonds in a molecule. The formula for the degree of unsaturation is: `DoU = C - (H/2) + 1` (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens; oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n    *   **For C6H12O2 (A):** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. A degree of unsaturation of 1 would be satisfied by the one C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid. This formula does not account for the additional C=C double bond confirmed by the FTIR and ¹H NMR data.\n    *   **For C6H10O2 (C):** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. A degree of unsaturation of 2 perfectly matches the structural features identified: one degree for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid and a second degree for the C=C double bond of the vinyl group.\n\nTherefore, based on the comprehensive analysis of all the provided spectra, the chemical formula of the unknown compound must be C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
