    "In the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), all operators must adhere to certain fundamental symmetries. These symmetries are inherent to the structure of quantum field theory and the underlying principles of the Standard Model.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental spacetime symmetry of the Standard Model and any relativistic quantum field theory. It dictates that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion. All operators in SMEFT are constructed to be Lorentz invariant.\n\n2.  **Poincaré symmetry**: This is a broader spacetime symmetry that includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations. SMEFT is constructed to be invariant under the Poincaré group.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry**: This is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) transformations. While the strong and electromagnetic interactions of the Standard Model conserve CP, the weak interaction violates it. SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model that allows for additional sources of CP violation from new physics at higher energy scales. Consequently, not all operators in SMEFT are required to be CP-symmetric; in fact, there is significant research into the classification of CP-violating operators within SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry**: This is the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal (T). The CPT theorem, a cornerstone of quantum field theory, states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the CPT transformation. As SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, all of its operators must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>"
