    "The scalar potential (V) and the vector potential (\\\\(\\vec{A}\\\\)) for a moving point charge are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These are derived directly from Maxwell's equations and represent the complete, relativistically correct electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe expressions for the potentials depend on the \"retarded\" time, *tr*. This is the time at which the field must have been generated by the charge to reach the observer at position \\\\(\\vec{r}\\\\) at time *t*, traveling at the speed of light *c*.\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\\\\(\\vec{A}\\\\)) are:\n*   **Scalar Potential:** \\\\(V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}\\\\)\n*   **Vector Potential:** \\\\(\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}\\\\)\n\nTo match these standard forms with the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by *c*:\n*   \\\\(V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}\\\\)\n*   \\\\(\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}\\\\)\n\nThese expressions precisely match the ones provided in option A. It's also worth noting that for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the vector potential is related to the scalar potential by \\\\(\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V\\\\).\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
