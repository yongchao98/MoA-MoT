    "### Calculation of the Angle Between Two Photons in Electron-Positron Annihilation\n\nTo determine the angle between the two photons produced in the annihilation of an electron and a positron, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the context of special relativity. The relativistic energy (E) and momentum (p) of a particle with rest mass (m) and Lorentz factor (γ) are key to this calculation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Initial State Analysis:**\n    *   An electron with a Lorentz factor (γ_e) of 4 moves from the left.\n    *   A positron with a Lorentz factor (γ_p) of 2 moves from the right.\n    *   The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by E = γmc², where 'm' is the rest mass and 'c' is the speed of light.\n    *   The total initial energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the electron and the positron:\n        E_initial = E_e + E_p = γ_e⋅mc² + γ_p⋅mc² = (4 + 2)mc² = 6mc²\n\n2.  **Final State Analysis:**\n    *   The annihilation produces two photons of equal energy (E_ph).\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons: E_final = E_ph + E_ph = 2E_ph.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   By equating the initial and final energy, we can find the energy of each photon:\n        E_initial = E_final\n        6mc² = 2E_ph\n        E_ph = 3mc²\n    *   The momentum of a photon (p_ph) is its energy divided by the speed of light (p = E/c).\n        p_ph = 3mc²/c = 3mc\n\n4.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The relativistic momentum of a particle can be calculated using the formula p = √(E² - (mc²)²)/c or p = mc√(γ² - 1).\n    *   Initial momentum of the electron (moving in the positive x-direction):\n        p_e = mc√(γ_e² - 1) = mc√(4² - 1) = mc√15\n    *   Initial momentum of the positron (moving in the negative x-direction):\n        p_p = -mc√(γ_p² - 1) = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3\n    *   The total initial momentum is purely in the x-direction:\n        P_initial_x = p_e + p_p = mc(√15 - √3)\n    *   The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero.\n\n5.  **Final Momentum and Angle Calculation:**\n    *   After the collision, one photon moves in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right. Due to the conservation of momentum, since the initial y-momentum was zero, the y-components of the photons' momenta must be equal and opposite. This means they are emitted at angles θ and -θ with respect to the horizontal (x-axis).\n    *   The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photon momenta:\n        P_final_x = p_ph⋅cos(θ) + p_ph⋅cos(-θ) = 2⋅p_ph⋅cos(θ) = 2(3mc)cos(θ) = 6mc⋅cos(θ)\n    *   By applying the conservation of momentum in the x-direction:\n        P_initial_x = P_final_x\n        mc(√15 - √3) = 6mc⋅cos(θ)\n    *   Solving for cos(θ):\n        cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n    *   Calculating the value:\n        cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n        θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\n6.  **Angle Between Photons:**\n    *   The angle between the two photons is the difference between their individual angles: θ - (-θ) = 2θ.\n    *   Angle = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis calculated value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<C>>>"
