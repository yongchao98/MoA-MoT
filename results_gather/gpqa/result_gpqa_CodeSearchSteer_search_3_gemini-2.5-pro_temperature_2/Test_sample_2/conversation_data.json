    "To find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x, we can calculate the expectation values of σ_z and σ_x separately and then combine them.\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nIn vector notation, this is:\n|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]\n\nThe bra vector, ⟨ψ|, is the conjugate transpose:\n⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]\n\nThe Pauli matrices are:\n*   σ_z = [, [0, -1]]\n*   σ_x = [,]\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value of σ_z:**\n\nThe expectation value is ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩.\nFirst, we apply σ_z to |ψ⟩:\nσ_z|ψ⟩ = [, [0, -1]] * [0.5, √3/2] = [0.5, -√3/2]\n\nNow, we calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|(σ_z|ψ⟩):\n⟨σ_z⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [0.5, -√3/2]\n⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5 * 0.5) + ( (√3)/2 * (-√3)/2 )\n⟨σ_z⟩ = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of σ_x:**\n\nThe expectation value is ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩.\nFirst, we apply σ_x to |ψ⟩:\nσ_x|ψ⟩ = [,] * [0.5, √3/2] = [√3/2, 0.5]\n\nNow, we calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|(σ_x|ψ⟩):\n⟨σ_x⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]\n⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2) + ( (√3)/2 * 0.5 )\n⟨σ_x⟩ = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2\n\n**3. Calculate the expectation value of the full operator:**\n\nThe expectation value of the operator O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x is given by ⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩.\n⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)\n⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<C>>>"
