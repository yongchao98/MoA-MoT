    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the major products for each rearrangement.\n\n### **Reaction A: Wittig Rearrangement**\n\nThe first reaction involves the treatment of `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene` with butyllithium (BuLi) followed by an acid workup (H+).\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The IUPAC name corresponds to benzyl prenyl ether: `C₆H₅-CH₂-O-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂`.\n2.  **Deprotonation:** BuLi is a strong base that removes the most acidic proton. The protons on the benzylic carbon (the one between the phenyl group and the oxygen) are the most acidic due to the resonance stabilization of the resulting carbanion by the phenyl ring.\n    *   `C₆H₅-CH₂-O-R + BuLi → C₆H₅-CH(-)-O-R + BuH`\n3.  **Rearrangement:** The resulting carbanion can undergo two competitive rearrangements: the-Wittig rearrangement and the-Wittig rearrangement.\n    *   **-Wittig rearrangement:** This is a concerted, pericyclic reaction where the carbanion attacks the terminal carbon (γ-carbon) of the allyl group's double bond. However, in this specific substrate, the γ-carbon is part of a `C(CH₃)₂` group, making it sterically hindered. This high steric hindrance disfavors the pathway.\n    *   **-Wittig rearrangement:** This pathway involves the migration of the entire alkyl group (the prenyl group) from the oxygen atom to the adjacent carbanionic carbon. This pathway is often competitive with the shift and can become the major pathway when the shift is sterically impeded.\n4.  **Product Formation (-Wittig):** The migration of the prenyl group results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between the benzylic carbon and the carbon of the prenyl group that was attached to the oxygen.\n    *   Intermediate alkoxide: `O(-)-CH(C₆H₅)-[CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂]`\n5.  **Protonation:** The acid workup (H+) protonates the alkoxide to yield the final alcohol product.\n    *   Product **A**: `HO-CH(C₆H₅)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂`\n6.  **Product Name:** The IUPAC name for this structure is **4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**.\n\n### **Reaction B: Cope Rearrangement**\n\nThe second reaction involves heating a complex polycyclic diene, which indicates a thermal rearrangement, specifically a Cope rearrangement as mentioned in the preamble.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** The Cope rearrangement is a-sigmatropic rearrangement of a 1,5-diene. It is an isomerization reaction, meaning the product has the same molecular formula as the starting material.\n2.  **Key Structural Features:** The starting material is described as `...-1,11-dimethylene...hexahydro...`. The \"dimethylene\" indicates two `C=CH₂` (exocyclic) double bonds. The \"hexahydro\" part of the name indicates the level of saturation of the core ring structure.\n3.  **Transformation:** In many Cope rearrangements of polycyclic systems, a key driving force is the formation of more thermodynamically stable, substituted (endocyclic) double bonds from less stable exocyclic ones. This reaction converts the 1,5-diene system composed of the two exocyclic double bonds into a new isomer with two endocyclic double bonds.\n4.  **Conservation of Formula:** Since the Cope rearrangement is an isomerization, the molecular formula does not change. Therefore, the number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved. The starting material is a `...hexahydro...` compound. The product must therefore also be a `...hexahydro...` compound, not a `...tetrahydro...` compound, as the latter would imply a loss of two hydrogen atoms (oxidation).\n5.  **Product Identity:** Based on the choices, product **B** must be the `hexahydro` derivative: **2,3,4,6,7,8-hexamethyl-5,9,9a,10,11,11a-hexahydro-1H-benzoazuleno[1,8,7,6-cdef]fluorene**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The major product for **A** is **4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**.\n*   The major product for **B** is the **hexahydrofluorene derivative**.\n\nMatching these products with the provided options leads to the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
