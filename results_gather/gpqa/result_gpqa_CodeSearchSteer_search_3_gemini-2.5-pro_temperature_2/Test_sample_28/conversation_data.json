    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the gene responsible for its synthesis must be rendered non-functional. The most effective way to achieve this is to introduce a mutation that causes the production of a severely truncated and incomplete protein. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation:\n\nFirst, let's break down the start of the intact gene's coding sequence into codons (three-letter codes):\n*   **Intact gene:** 5’-**ATG**-**TTT**-**CTC**-GCT...-3’\n\nNow let's examine the mutants:\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-**ATG**-**TTC**-**TAC**-GCT...-3’\n    *   The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`. Both code for the amino acid Phenylalanine, so this is a silent mutation.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a missense mutation, which changes a single amino acid. While this could potentially affect protein function, it often does not eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-**ATG**-**TTC**-**TAA**-GCT...-3’\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a stop codon (also known as a nonsense codon). This mutation signals the cell's machinery to stop protein synthesis prematurely.\n    *   This leads to a drastically shortened, incomplete, and almost certainly non-functional protein. This type of change, a nonsense mutation, is very likely to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-**ATG**-**TTT**-**TAC**-GCT-GGT-**GTC**-**ACT**...-3’\n    *   Compared to the intact gene, this mutant contains several missense mutations (e.g., Leucine to Tyrosine, Threonine to Valine). Like Mutant 1, changing multiple amino acids increases the chance of disrupting the protein's function but does not guarantee its elimination as definitively as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-**ATG**-**TTT**-**TAC**-GCT-**ACT**-TCT...-3’\n    *   Comparing the sequence to the intact gene (`5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...-3’`) shows that in Mutant 4 (`5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...-3’`), the codon `GGT` has been deleted.\n    *   This is an in-frame deletion, meaning a single amino acid is removed without altering the subsequent \"reading frame\" of the gene. Similar to a missense mutation, the removal of one amino acid might or might not inactivate the protein.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the protein sequence. This is the most reliable way to ensure that a functional protein is not produced, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
