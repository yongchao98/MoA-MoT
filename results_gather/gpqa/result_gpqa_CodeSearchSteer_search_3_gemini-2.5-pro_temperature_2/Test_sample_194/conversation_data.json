    "### The maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days.\n\nTo determine the maximum orbital period for the second planet, a multi-step calculation based on the principles of orbital mechanics is required. The key is that both planets share the same orbital plane, and therefore, the same inclination relative to the observer.\n\nFirst, the transit impact parameter (`b`) must be understood. It represents the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet during a transit, measured in units of the star's radius. A transit is generally considered to occur if this value is between 0 and 1. A value of `b=0` means the planet transits across the center of the star, while `b=1` signifies a \"grazing\" transit, where the planet's center passes along the star's edge. For a planet to exhibit a transit, its impact parameter `b` must be less than or equal to 1. The condition of also having an occultation is automatically met for a planet in a circular orbit that transits its star.\n\nThe properties of the first planet allow for the determination of the system's orbital inclination. The impact parameter `b₁` is given by the formula:\n`b₁ = (a₁ * cos(i)) / Rₛ = 0.2`\nwhere `a₁` is the semi-major axis of the first planet, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `Rₛ` is the stellar radius.\n\nFor the second planet to have the maximum possible orbital period, it must have the maximum possible semi-major axis (`a₂`) at which a transit can still occur. This limiting condition corresponds to a grazing transit, where the impact parameter `b₂` is equal to 1.\n`b₂ = (a₂_max * cos(i)) / Rₛ = 1`\n\nBy setting up a ratio of the two impact parameter equations, the stellar radius (`Rₛ`) and the inclination (`cos(i)`) can be eliminated:\n`(a₂_max * cos(i)) / Rₛ` / `(a₁ * cos(i)) / Rₛ` = `1 / 0.2`\nThis simplifies to:\n`a₂_max / a₁ = 5`\nTherefore, the maximum semi-major axis for the second planet is 5 times the semi-major axis of the first planet.\n\nFinally, Kepler's Third Law is applied, which states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`P² ∝ a³`). The ratio of the periods of the two planets can be related to the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n`(P₂_max / P₁)² = (a₂_max / a₁ )³`\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n`(P₂_max / 3)² = 5³ = 125`\n\nSolving for the maximum period of the second planet (`P₂_max`):\n`P₂_max = 3 * √125`\n`P₂_max ≈ 3 * 11.18`\n`P₂_max ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThus, the maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days. The radii of the planets and the star are not required for this specific calculation, as they cancel out.\n\n<<<B>>>"
