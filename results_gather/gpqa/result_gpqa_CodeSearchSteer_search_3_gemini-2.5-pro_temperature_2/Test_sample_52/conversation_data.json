    "The problem asks to identify the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectral data. Here's a systematic breakdown of the information to determine the correct formula.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Data\n\n1.  **Molecular Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring with two substituents). This core structure is C₆H₄.\n2.  **FTIR Spectrum:** An absorption peak indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). An ester group contains a carbonyl (C=O) and a C-O bond.\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** This is consistent with the four protons on a di-substituted benzene ring. The number of signals depends on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals - one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is highly indicative of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring (-**CH**=CH-CH₃) would be split by the other vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet.\n        *   The next proton (-CH=**CH**-CH₃) would be split by the first vinyl proton (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **-CH₃ Groups (2 signals):** One methyl group is from the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-**CH₃**). Since there are two methyl signals, the second must belong to the ester group.\n    *   **No -CH₂ Groups:** The spectrum shows no signals for methylene (-CH₂) groups. This is a crucial piece of information, meaning the ester cannot be an ethyl ester or have any other -CH₂- linkers. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, suggesting a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃).\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Formula\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Substituent:** -CH=CH-CH₃ → C₃H₅\n*   **Ester and Methyl Substituent:** This must be either a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). In both cases, the atoms contributed are C₂H₃O₂.\n\nNow, we combine these fragments to get the total molecular formula:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** Incorrect number of carbons.\n*   **B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** Matches the formula derived from the spectral data.\n*   **C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** Incorrect number of carbons and hydrogens. This formula would likely contain a CH₂ group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n*   **D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This formula has two extra hydrogens compared to our finding. Adding two hydrogens while keeping the carbon count the same would mean losing a degree of unsaturation (i.e., a double bond), which contradicts the presence of the propenyl group.\n\nThe systematic analysis of the provided spectral information logically and consistently leads to the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which matches one of the provided options. Search results confirm that compounds with the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ exist and that determining structures from this type of spectral data is a standard chemical practice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
