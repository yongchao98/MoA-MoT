    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. We are given the formation constant (also known as the stability constant) for the Ca-EDTA complex, K_f = 5x10^10. The reaction is assumed to occur at an ideal pH and at a temperature of 25 °C.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented by the following equilibrium:\n\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe given constant, K_f, is the equilibrium constant for this formation reaction. However, to find the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions, we should consider the dissociation of the complex:\n\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction, K_d, is the reciprocal of the formation constant:\n\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5x10^10) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\nNow, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ that dissociates.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻     | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺            | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\nThe dissociation constant expression is:\n\nK_d = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n\nSubstituting the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n\n2x10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nSince the formation constant is very large, the dissociation constant is very small. This implies that the complex dissociates very little, so 'x' will be much smaller than 0.02. Therefore, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n2x10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\nx² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\nx² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\nx = √(4x10⁻¹³) = √(40x10⁻¹⁴) = 2√10 x 10⁻⁷\nx ≈ 2 * 3.16 x 10⁻⁷\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\n[Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 1.0x10⁻² M\nC) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nD) 2.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
