    "The calculation to determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron requires understanding the energy gained during each turn. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Energy Gain per Crossing**: A proton in a synchrocyclotron gains energy each time it crosses the gap between the two D-shaped electrodes. The energy gained per crossing is determined by the accelerating voltage at that moment and the charge of the proton. The voltage is given by the formula \\\\(U(t) = U_0 \\cos(2\\pi\\nu(\\alpha)t + \\Phi_0)\\\\). In a synchrocyclotron, particles are accelerated at a constant synchronous phase, which is given in this problem as \\\\(\\Phi_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\\\).\n\n2.  **Energy Gain per Revolution**: The proton is accelerated twice in each revolution. The energy gained in one full turn is the sum of the energy from both accelerations. Therefore, the energy gain per revolution (\\\\(\\Delta T_{rev}\\\\)) is given by:\n    \\\\(\\Delta T_{rev} = 2 \\times q \\times U_0 \\times \\cos(\\Phi_0)\\\\)\n    where:\n    *   `q` is the elementary charge of a proton (`e`).\n    *   \\\\(U_0\\\\) is the peak voltage, given as 190 kV.\n    *   \\\\(\\Phi_0\\\\) is the synchronous phase, \\\\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\\\).\n\n3.  **Calculation of Energy Gain per Revolution**:\n    *   The charge of the proton `e` multiplied by the voltage `U₀` gives the energy in electronvolts. With \\\\(U_0 = 190 \\text{ kV}\\\\), the energy `eU₀` is 190 keV, or 0.190 MeV.\n    *   \\\\(\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.707\\\\).\n    *   Plugging these values into the formula:\n        \\\\(\\Delta T_{rev} = 2 \\times 0.190 \\text{ MeV} \\times \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = 0.380 \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\text{ MeV} \\approx 0.2687 \\text{ MeV}\\\\)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Total Number of Revolutions**: The total number of revolutions (`N`) is the final kinetic energy (\\\\(T_1\\\\)) divided by the energy gained per revolution (\\\\(\\Delta T_{rev}\\\\)). The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy and reaches a final kinetic energy of 950 MeV.\n    *   \\\\(N = \\frac{\\text{Total Kinetic Energy}}{\\text{Energy Gain per Revolution}} = \\frac{T_1}{\\Delta T_{rev}}\\\\)\n    *   \\\\(N = \\frac{950 \\text{ MeV}}{0.380 \\times \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{950 \\times \\sqrt{2}}{0.380}\\\\)\n    *   \\\\(N \\approx \\frac{950 \\times 1.4142}{0.380} \\approx \\frac{1343.5}{0.380} \\approx 3535.53\\\\)\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number gives 3536 revolutions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
