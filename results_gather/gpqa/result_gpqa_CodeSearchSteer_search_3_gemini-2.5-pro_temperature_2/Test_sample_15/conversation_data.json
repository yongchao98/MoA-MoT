    "An analysis of each compound determines its potential to exhibit optical activity, which requires the molecule to be chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs in molecules that have a carbon atom bonded to four different groups (a chiral center) and lack an internal plane of symmetry.\n\nHere is the breakdown of each compound:\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule does not contain any chiral centers. The carbons of the double bond are bonded to only three groups, and no other carbon atom is bonded to four different substituents. Therefore, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The IUPAC name specifies the stereochemistry at two chiral centers, (3aR,7aS). The designation of a specific enantiomer indicates that the compound is chiral and therefore optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This compound has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R,3S) configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule also has two chiral centers. The (2R,3R) configuration is a specific enantiomer that is not superimposable on its mirror image (the 2S,3S enantiomer). It does not have an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral and optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The designation (R) in the name refers to the chiral center at carbon 1, which is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, and two different carbon paths around the ring). Naming a specific enantiomer confirms it is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (`cis`). This arrangement results in multiple planes of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and optically inactive despite the presence of carbons bonded to four different groups.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** A review of this molecule's structure, (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2, shows that it does not contain any chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, and no other carbon meets the criteria for a chiral center. Thus, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, a total of 3 compounds will be optically active.\n\n<<<C>>>"
