    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the relative speed and total energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Relative Speed\n\nTo find the relative speed (v_rel) between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let v1 be the velocity of the first astronaut (0.6c) and v2 be the velocity of the second astronaut (0.5c). Both are moving in the same direction.\n\nThe formula is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Total Energy\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The formula for relativistic energy (E) is `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, given by `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):**\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\n`γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n`γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n`γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n`γ1 = 1 / 0.8`\n`γ1 = 1.25`\n\nNext, calculate the energy (E1):\n`E1 = γ1 * (2m) * c^2`\n`E1 = 1.25 * 2mc^2`\n`E1 = 2.5mc^2`\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):**\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\n`γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n`γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n`γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n`γ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866`\n`γ2 ≈ 1.1547`\n\nNext, calculate the energy (E2):\n`E2 = γ2 * (3m) * c^2`\n`E2 ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc^2`\n`E2 ≈ 3.4641mc^2`\n\n**Total Energy of the System:**\n\nThe total energy (E_total) is the sum of E1 and E2.\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n`E_total ≈ 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2`\n`E_total ≈ 5.9641mc^2`\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96mc^2**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96mc^2**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
