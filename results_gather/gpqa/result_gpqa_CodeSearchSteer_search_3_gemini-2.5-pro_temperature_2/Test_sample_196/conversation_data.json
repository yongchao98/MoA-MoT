    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\n1.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a classic indicator of the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid. Its position suggests it might be conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\n    *Conclusion from IR:* The data strongly suggests that compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet in the far downfield region is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield shift of the 8.0 ppm signal is due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H is typical of a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H represents a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This multiplet for 2H is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂) situated between the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and the methine group at 2.9 ppm.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This multiplet for 1H is the benzylic methine (-CH) proton, attached to both the aromatic ring and the rest of the alkyl chain.\n\n    *Assembly of the Structure:* Putting the pieces together, the alkyl group is a -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃, which is a *sec*-butyl group. This group is attached to a benzene ring that also bears a carboxylic acid group at the para position. Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n### Reaction and Final Product Identification\n\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Transformation:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent, capable of the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction reduces the C=O group and the -OH group of the carboxylic acid to a -CH₃.\n*   **Applying the Reaction:**\n    *   Starting Material (Compound X): 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring remain unchanged under these conditions.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the spectroscopic analysis, compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carboxylic acid to a methyl group. This yields 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene as the final product.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This is the correct final product.\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
