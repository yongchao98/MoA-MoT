    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations to determine the final product and answer the question.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C**\n    The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with a strong base like potassium hydroxide (KOH) under harsh conditions can lead to complex reactions including eliminations and rearrangements. The provided data for **Product 1** shows a characteristic ketone absorption in the IR spectrum (1720 cm⁻¹) and NMR data that indicates a C₁₀H₁₄O formula. While the specific structure of Product 1 is difficult to determine from the given information alone (the NMR data is unusual), its identity as a ketone is the key takeaway for the next step.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide**\n    This reaction uses aluminum isopropoxide, the reagent for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This process reduces ketones to alcohols. It's noted that side reactions, such as dehydration of the newly formed alcohol, can sometimes occur. Given that the reaction is heated, it's plausible that the ketone (Product 1) is first reduced to an alcohol, which is then dehydrated to form an alkene (**Product 2**). This sequence (Ketone → Alcohol → Alkene) is a chemically sound pathway. The resulting alkene, derived from an adamantane-like skeleton, would have the formula C₁₀H₁₄. A plausible and stable alkene formed through cage rearrangement and elimination in this context is **protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Ozonolysis of Product 2**\n    Ozone (O₃) followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is a standard procedure for ozonolysis with reductive workup. This reaction cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond and converts each of the original double-bond carbons into a carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone). The ozonolysis of protoadamant-4-ene is known to cleave the double bond and, after rearrangement of the initial product, forms **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione** as **Product 3**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Final Product's ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe final product, **Product 3**, is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n\n1.  **Structure and Symmetry:** This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has two equivalent six-membered rings in a double-chair conformation (though some studies suggest a chair-boat), with ketone groups at the C3 and C7 positions. The key positions for ¹H NMR are the bridgehead protons (H1, H5), the protons alpha to the carbonyls (on C2, C4, C6, C8), and the methylene protons on the C9 bridge.\n\n2.  **Most Deshielded Proton:** In the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring system, the bridgehead protons (H1 and H5) are often the most deshielded. This effect is enhanced in the dione product because these protons are in a beta (β) position to two separate electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This deshielding effect makes them the protons that will appear furthest downfield in the NMR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Coupling Pattern:** To determine the splitting pattern of the bridgehead proton (let's consider H1), we must identify its neighbors and their coupling constants (J-values).\n    *   H1 is bonded to C1, which is connected to C2, C8, and C9.\n    *   Therefore, H1 is coupled to the two protons on C2, the two protons on C8, and the two protons on C9.\n    *   Due to the rigid, chair-like geometry of the rings, the protons on C2 (and C8) are not equivalent; there is one axial proton and one equatorial proton.\n    *   H1 will have a vicinal coupling to the axial proton on C2 (H2-ax) and the equatorial proton on C2 (H2-eq). According to the Karplus relationship, these couplings will be different. The same applies to the C8 protons.\n    *   By symmetry, the two axial alpha-protons (H2-ax, H8-ax) are equivalent to each other.\n    *   Similarly, the two equatorial alpha-protons (H2-eq, H8-eq) are equivalent to each other.\n    *   A proton coupled to two equivalent protons is split into a **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, H1 is first split into a triplet by the two equivalent axial protons, and each of these lines is further split into a triplet by the two equivalent equatorial protons.\n    *   This results in a theoretical pattern of a **triplet of triplets**. The coupling to the C9 protons is often smaller or unresolved, and is commonly ignored in textbook analysis of such systems.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most deshielded hydrogen atom (the bridgehead proton) will exhibit a triplet of triplets coupling pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
