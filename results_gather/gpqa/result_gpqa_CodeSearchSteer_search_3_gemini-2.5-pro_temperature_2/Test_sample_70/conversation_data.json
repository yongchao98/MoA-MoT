    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n**1. Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates away. Assuming the planet is a black body, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (r) from the star. This can be expressed as:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1/√r\n\n**2. Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). Since the problem specifies that the exoplanets have circular orbits, the semi-major axis is equal to the orbital radius (r). Therefore, we have:\n\nP² ∝ r³\n\nFrom this relationship, we can express the orbital radius in terms of the orbital period:\n\nr ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n**3. Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Period**\n\nBy substituting the expression for the orbital radius (r) from Kepler's Third Law into the equilibrium temperature formula, we can find the relationship between the equilibrium temperature and the orbital period:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4. Calculating the Temperature Ratio**\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq,4 / T_eq,2). Using the relationship derived above:\n\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. This gives us the ratio of the periods for Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n\nP_4 / P_2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\nNow, we can substitute this value into our temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (1 / 1.75)^(1/3)\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 ≈ 0.8298\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.69\nB) ~0.83\nC) ~0.75\nD) ~0.57\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
