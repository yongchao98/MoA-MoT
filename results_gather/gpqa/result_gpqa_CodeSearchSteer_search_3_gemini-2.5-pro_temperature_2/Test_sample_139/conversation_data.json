    "The information gathered confirms the key points of the deduction.\n\n*   **Substance B / Liquid Y**: The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is very close to the 277 K given in the problem. The violent reaction described also points towards D₂O being liquid Y.\n*   **Substance X & its analog**: Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄), are powerful reducing agents used in organic chemistry. They react violently with water.\n*   **Gas W**: A molecule with an equal number of protons and neutrons is a key clue. Deuterium gas, D₂, consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O produces D₂ gas. In contrast, reacting a deuteride like LiAlD₄ with normal water (H₂O) would primarily produce HD gas, which does not have an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n*   **Precipitate G**: The reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O would produce LiOD and Al(OD)₃. Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, would be the precipitate (G), which upon heating would decompose to release heavy water, D₂O (B).\n*   **Keto Acid Reaction**: Lithium aluminum hydride is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids. Therefore, it would reduce a keto acid to a diol, a molecule that contains two oxygen atoms, which matches the problem description.\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**: The elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄) are Lithium (Z=3), Aluminum (Z=13), and Hydrogen (Z=1, in the form of the isotope Deuterium). The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen. The heaviest is Aluminum.\n*   **Atomic Masses**: For the calculation, integer atomic masses of the most stable or common isotopes are appropriate for this kind of problem. The common isotope of Lithium is ⁷Li and the only stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al. The mass number of deuterium (D) is 2.\n\nThe reasoning remains sound. Substance X is LiAlD₄. The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest (Hydrogen) and heaviest (Aluminum) elements in the formula.\n\n*   **Lightest element (Hydrogen)**: There are 4 atoms of its isotope, Deuterium (D), each with a mass of 2.\n*   **Heaviest element (Aluminum)**: There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al), with a mass of 27.\n*   **Calculation**: (4 * 2) + 27 = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nFinal check of all steps and conditions against the search results confirms the identification of the substances and the subsequent calculation. The clues fit together perfectly to point to LiAlD₄ as substance X and the interpretation of the calculation leading to the answer 35.\n\nFinal Answer based on the deduction:\n1.  **Identify Substance X:** Based on the reaction properties described (release of D₂ gas, reaction with a keto acid to a diol, melting point of byproduct B being that of D₂O), Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n2.  **Identify Elements:** The constituent elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n3.  **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium). The heaviest element is Aluminum.\n4.  **Calculate Cumulative Mass:** The problem asks for the cumulative atomic mass of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Mass of all Deuterium atoms in LiAlD₄: 4 x (atomic mass of D) = 4 x 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of all Aluminum atoms in LiAlD₄: 1 x (atomic mass of Al) = 1 x 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe result matches one of the options.\n\nThe chemical puzzle has been solved. I am ready to give the final answer.\nI have deduced the identity of substance X to be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). The detailed step-by-step reasoning has been laid out, supported by verified chemical principles. The final calculation is based on this identification and the specific instructions in the prompt. I am confident in the answer.\nThe puzzle involves identifying a series of chemical substances and reactions based on provided clues.\n\n1.  **Substance B:** The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K (~4°C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K), which is an excellent match.\n2.  **Substance X and Gas W:** Substance X reacts to release a gas W whose molecules contain an equal number of neutrons and protons. Deuterium gas (D₂) fits this description perfectly; each deuterium atom contains 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This implies that Substance X is a deuterated compound. The release of D₂ gas suggests a reaction with a deuterium source, likely the heavy water (D₂O) identified as substance Y.\n3.  **The Reaction:** For D₂ gas to be produced, substance X must be a deuterated reducing agent reacting with heavy water (Y). Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) is a very close analog to lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄), a common reagent in organic chemistry. The reaction LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑ fits all the clues. The precipitate G would be aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which upon heating releases heavy water, D₂O (Substance B).\n4.  **Keto Acid Reaction:** A keto acid possesses both a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. Lithium aluminum hydride is a strong reducing agent known to reduce both of these groups to alcohols (-OH). The resulting product, a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), would contain exactly two oxygen atoms, which matches the problem description. Therefore, X is confidently identified as LiAlD₄.\n5.  **The Calculation:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (atomic number Z=3), Aluminum (Z=13), and Hydrogen (Z=1, represented by the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements found in one molecule of the substance. For this type of problem, integer mass numbers of the most common/stable isotopes are used. Deuterium (D) has a mass number of 2. The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n    *   In one molecule of LiAlD₄, there are four atoms of Deuterium and one atom of Aluminum.\n    *   Sum of masses of the lightest element's atoms = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Sum of masses of the heaviest element's atoms = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative atomic mass is 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
