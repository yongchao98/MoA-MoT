    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the <sup>1</sup>H NMR Signals:**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet peak representing three protons is characteristic of a methyl group that is not coupled to any other protons. This is a classic signal for the acetyl group (CH₃-C=O) in an acetate ester. All four possible compounds contain this group, so this signal is consistent with all options.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet peak representing three protons indicates a methyl group (CH₃-) coupled to a single proton (-CH). This suggests a `CH₃-CH` fragment.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (in the 5-8 ppm region):** There are two signals in the alkene region.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal for one proton is a doublet of quartets. This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (d, doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (q, quartet). This is consistent with a proton in a `CH₃-CH=CH-` arrangement, where this proton is coupled to the adjacent methyl group and the other vinyl proton.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal for one proton is a doublet with a large coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. This indicates it is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton:**\n    *   The total integration of protons is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n    *   Let's check the proton count for the possible structures:\n        *   **Propenyl acetate** (`CH₃CH=CHOAc`): Has 3 (CH₃) + 1 (=CH) + 1 (=CH) + 3 (OAc) = 8 protons. This matches the data.\n        *   **Butenyl acetate** (e.g., `CH₃CH=CHCH₂OAc`): Has 3 (CH₃) + 1 (=CH) + 1 (=CH) + 2 (CH₂) + 3 (OAc) = 10 protons. This does not match the data.\n    *   Based on the proton count, the compound must be a **propenyl acetate**. This eliminates options A (Trans-butenyl acetate) and B (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n    *   The remaining options are Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n    *   The distinction between cis and trans isomers is made by looking at the coupling constant (J value) between the two vinyl protons.\n    *   For trans-alkenes, the coupling constant between protons on opposite sides of the double bond is typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n    *   For cis-alkenes, the coupling constant between protons on the same side of the double bond is smaller, typically in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The given J value for the doublet at 7.0 ppm is **16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely in the range for a *trans* configuration.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data corresponds to a propenyl acetate structure with a trans configuration on the double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
