    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This describes a planet essentially identical to Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm³, which is roughly the same as Earth's density.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** A planet with a similar composition but less mass will experience weaker gravitational pull. This leads to less self-compression, resulting in a density lower than Earth's.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will have stronger gravity. This increased gravity compresses the planet's material more tightly, leading to a higher overall density. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass rocky planet will be significantly denser than Earth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options:\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (d) would have a density lower than 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) would have a density significantly higher than 5.5 g/cm³ due to gravitational compression.\n\nTherefore, the planet with five times the mass of Earth has the highest density.\n\n<<<D>>>"
