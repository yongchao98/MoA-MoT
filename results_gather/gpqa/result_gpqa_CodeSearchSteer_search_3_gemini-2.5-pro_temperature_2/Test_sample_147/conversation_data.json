    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2**\n\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with the mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) being 31.96% (or 0.3196). Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where M(Y) is the atomic mass of element Y and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The atomic mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    Plugging in the known values:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * (n * 19.00) = n * 19.00\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 - (0.3196 * n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = (n * 12.9276) / 0.3196\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now we test integer values for n:\n    *   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (This corresponds to Argon or Calcium, which do not fit the chemical context of forming five reactive fluorides).\n    *   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (This is close to Bromine or Selenium, but the mass fractions for their known fluorides do not match).\n    *   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is a very close match to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No stable element has this atomic mass).\n\n    Let's verify the mass fraction for SbF3 (Antimony trifluoride):\n    M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol\n    ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%\n    This calculated value is extremely close to the given value of 31.96%, with a relative difference of only about 0.25%. Thus, we can confidently identify **Y as Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 as SbF3**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Other Compounds and Reactions**\n\n    *   **Y = Sb**, **A2 = SbF3**.\n    *   A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine: `A1 -> SbF3 + F2`. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony. The most common higher fluoride is **SbF5**. The decomposition reaction would be `SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2`.\n    *   A1 and A3 oxidize xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Sb). Fluorination of antimony yields SbF5. SbF5 is a powerful oxidizing agent and a very strong Lewis acid known to react with xenon compounds. This fits the description. So, A1 and A3 are both likely **SbF5**. (Note: The problem states A1 is bright-red, while SbF5 is colorless; this appears to be a discrepancy in the problem statement, but other evidence for Sb is very strong).\n    *   We now have identified two of the five binary compounds: **SbF3** (A2) and **SbF5** (A1, A3).\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A4**\n\n    The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. We know that A4 must be one of the binary fluorides of antimony. The two principal candidates are SbF3 and SbF5.\n    Let's calculate their molecular weights:\n    *   Molecular weight of A4 if it is **SbF3** = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n    *   Molecular weight of A4 if it is **SbF5** = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Ranges**\n\n    Now, let's check which of these molecular weights falls into the given answer choices:\n    *   A) 110-130\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) **160-180**\n    *   D) 220-240\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) fits perfectly within range C. The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fall within any of the ranges, although it is closest to range D.\n\n    The chemical information about the reaction involving A4 (`Y + A4 -> A5` in a 1:1 ratio) is complex and potentially confusing. However, the quantitative match of the molecular weight provides the most direct path to the answer. Based on the calculated molecular weight fitting perfectly into one of the options, A4 is most likely SbF3.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 is 178.76 g/mol, which falls into the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<C>>>"
