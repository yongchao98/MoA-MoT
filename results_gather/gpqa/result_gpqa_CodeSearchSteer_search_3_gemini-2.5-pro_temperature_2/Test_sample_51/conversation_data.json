    "The detailed step-by-step derivation to solve the problem is as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics\nThe problem requires comparing the ratio of atoms in two different energy levels at two different temperatures. This is governed by the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) in the stellar photosphere allows us to use this equation.\n\n### Step 2: The Boltzmann Equation\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy levels, an upper level 2 and a lower level 1:\n\n(N₂ / N₁) = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in energy levels 2 and 1.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels. Since they are not given, we assume the ratio g₂/g₁ is a constant that will cancel out.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE)\nThe energy difference (ΔE) between the two levels corresponds to a photon with a specific wavelength (λ). The relationship is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nWhere:\n*   h is Planck's constant.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the transition, given as 1448 Å (or 1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m).\n\nFor astrophysical calculations, it's often convenient to use units of electron-volts (eV) for energy and angstroms (Å) for wavelength. The conversion constant hc is approximately 12400 eV·Å.\n\nΔE (eV) ≈ 12400 eV·Å / 1448 Å ≈ 8.56 eV\n\n### Step 4: Define the Ratios for Both Scenarios\nLet's define the population ratio R = N₂ / N₁ for the two temperature conditions: the stellar surface without spots and with spots.\n\n*   **Without spots:** The temperature T_nospot is 6000 K.\n    R_nospot = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot))\n\n*   **With spots:** The effective temperature T_spot is 5500 K.\n    R_spot = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot))\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Factor of Change\nThe problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. This means we need to compute the ratio of the ratios: `Factor = R_nospot / R_spot`.\n\nFactor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * 6000 K)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * 5500 K)) ]\n\nThe term (g₂/g₁) cancels out. Using the properties of exponents (exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a-b)), we get:\n\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]\n\n### Step 6: Perform the Final Calculation\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the term ΔE/k. The Boltzmann constant (k) is approximately 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K.\n\nΔE / k ≈ 8.56 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99340 K\n\nNow, let's calculate the temperature-dependent part:\n\n(1/6000 - 1/5500) = (11 - 12) / 66000 = -1 / 66000 K⁻¹\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the expression for the factor:\n\nFactor = exp[ -99340 K * (-1 / 66000 K⁻¹) ]\nFactor = exp(99340 / 66000)\nFactor = exp(1.505)\nFactor ≈ 4.50\n\nThe calculation shows that the ratio of Ti atoms in level 2 to level 1 is about 4.5 times higher when the star's surface is hotter (no spots) compared to when it is cooler (with spots).\n\nThe final answer is approximately 4.5. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
