    "The problem of radioactive decay is governed by a principle known as the memoryless property of exponential decay. This principle states that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. Therefore, the fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability. The problem is equivalent to calculating the decay probability for a fresh atom over a period of 150 minutes.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the decay constant (λ):** The probability of decay P(t) within a time *t* is given by the formula P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay is 32% in 100 minutes, so P(100) = 0.32.\n    *   0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n    *   e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68)\n    *   λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:** We need to find P(150), the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval.\n    *   P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n    *   Substitute the expression for λ we found in the first step:\n        P(150) = 1 - e^((-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)\n    *   P(150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))\n    *   Using the property of logarithms, *a* ln(*b*) = ln(*b*^a):\n        P(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))\n    *   Since e^ln(x) = x:\n        P(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5\n    *   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n        0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n    *   P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\n3.  **Convert to a percentage and compare with the options:**\n    *   0.4393 is equivalent to 43.93%.\n    *   This value is closest to option B) 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
