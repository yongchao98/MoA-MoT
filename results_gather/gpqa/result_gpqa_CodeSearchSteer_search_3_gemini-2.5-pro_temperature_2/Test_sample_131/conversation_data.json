    "To determine the two aromatic compounds present in the 1:1 mixture, we must analyze the provided 1H NMR data and compare it with the expected spectra for each of the potential compounds.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Mixture's 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integral ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1, this means each signal corresponds to the same number of protons. The total number of aromatic protons in a mixture of two C10H14 tetramethylbenzene isomers is four (two from each compound). A 1:1 ratio therefore means each singlet signal integrates to 2H.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integral ratio. The total number of alkyl protons is 24 (12 from each compound). If we let the integral of the smallest peak be 'x', the total integral is 2x + x + x = 4x. So, 4x = 24H, which means x = 6H. The three singlets therefore correspond to integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**Summary of the observed spectrum for the mixture:**\n*   **Aromatic:** Singlet (2H), Singlet (2H).\n*   **Alkyl:** Singlet (12H), Singlet (6H), Singlet (6H).\n\n### **2. Predicted 1H NMR Spectra for Individual Compounds**\n\nWe will now predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the possible compounds, all of which have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single **singlet** with an integral of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce a single **singlet** with an integral of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at H-4 and H-6 are not equivalent. They will appear as two distinct signals, which are typically **singlets** (long-range coupling is often unresolved). Each singlet has an integral of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C2, the one at C5, and the pair at C1 and C3 (which are equivalent by symmetry). This results in three **singlets** with integrals of **3H**, **3H**, and **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at H-5 and H-6 are adjacent and will couple with each other, producing two **doublets**, each with an integral of **1H**. This does not match the observed singlets.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3), resulting in two **singlets**, each with an integral of **6H**.\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing one **singlet** with an integral of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups are not singlets; they will appear as a **quartet** (for the -CH2-) and a **triplet** (for the -CH3-). This does not match the observed singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe are looking for a pair of compounds whose combined spectra match the observed data.\n\n*   Options A and B can be eliminated because they include 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, which would show doublets in the aromatic region, not singlets.\n*   Option D can be eliminated as it includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would show a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n\nThis leaves **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.**\n\nLet's see if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds can produce the observed spectrum through the superposition and accidental overlap of signals.\n\n*   **From 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Aromatic: Singlet (2H).\n    *   Alkyl: Singlet (12H).\n*   **From 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Aromatic: Singlet (1H), Singlet (1H).\n    *   Alkyl: Singlet (6H), Singlet (3H), Singlet (3H).\n\n**Combining the Spectra (Superposition):**\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:** The problem states there are three singlets with integrals 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   Durene provides the **12H singlet**.\n    *   Isodurene provides the **6H singlet**.\n    *   For the third signal to be a 6H singlet, the two non-equivalent 3H methyl signals from isodurene must have the same chemical shift (a phenomenon known as accidental isochrony or overlap). This would cause them to appear as a single peak with a combined integral of 6H. This combination perfectly matches the alkyl data (three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The problem states there are two singlets, each with an integral of 2H.\n    *   Durene provides one of the **2H singlets**.\n    *   For the second 2H singlet to form, the two non-equivalent 1H aromatic proton signals from isodurene must also have the same chemical shift and overlap, producing a single peak with a combined integral of 2H.\n\nTherefore, the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that can explain the observed 1H NMR data, requiring the coincidental overlap of signals from the isodurene molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>"
