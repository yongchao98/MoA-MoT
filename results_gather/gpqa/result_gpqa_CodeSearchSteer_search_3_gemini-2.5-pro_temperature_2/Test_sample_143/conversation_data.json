    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the proper lifetime (τ) of the particle.**\n    The proper lifetime (τ) is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. It is related to the decay width (Γ) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n    τ = ħ / Γ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) and velocity (β = v/c).**\n    The Lorentz factor accounts for the time dilation effect due to the particle's high velocity. It is calculated from the particle's total energy (E) and mass (m):\n    γ = E / mc²\n    The velocity in terms of the speed of light (c) is given by:\n    β = √(1 - 1/γ²)\n\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (L) in the laboratory frame.**\n    Due to time dilation, the lifetime in the laboratory frame is γτ. The distance the particle travels before decaying is this lifetime multiplied by its velocity (v = βc).\n    L = v * (γτ) = βc * γ * τ\n\nCombining these steps, we can use the formula:\nL = (ħc / Γ) * γ * β = (ħc / Γ) * √(γ² - 1)\n\n**Given values:**\n*   Energy (Eₓ): 8 GeV\n*   Mass (mₓc²): 1.2 GeV\n*   Decay Width (Γₓ): 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV\n*   The value of the reduced Planck constant times the speed of light (ħc) is approximately 197.3 MeV·fm.\n\n**Step-by-step calculation:**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    γ = Eₓ / mₓc² = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20/3 ≈ 6.667\n\n2.  **Calculate γ² - 1:**\n    γ² - 1 = (20/3)² - 1 = 400/9 - 9/9 = 391/9 ≈ 43.44\n\n3.  **Calculate √(γ² - 1):**\n    √(391/9) = √391 / 3 ≈ 6.591\n\n4.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (L):**\n    L = (ħc / Γₓ) * √(γ² - 1)\n    L = (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV) * (√391 / 3)\n    L ≈ 0.61656 fm * 6.591\n    L ≈ 4.0636 fm\n\nSince 1 femtometer (fm) = 10⁻¹⁵ meters (m), the mean decay distance is approximately 4.0636 * 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\nA more precise calculation using:\n*   ħ = 1.054571817 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c = 299792458 m/s\n*   1 MeV = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹³ J\n*   Γₓ = 320 MeV = 5.1269652288 × 10⁻¹¹ J\n\nyields:\nL = ( (1.054571817 × 10⁻³⁴ * 299792458) / 5.1269652288 × 10⁻¹¹ ) * √( (8/1.2)² - 1 )\nL ≈ 4.0655 × 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
