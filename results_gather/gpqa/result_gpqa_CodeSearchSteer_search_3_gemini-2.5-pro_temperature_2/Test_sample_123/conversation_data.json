    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand Particle Decay and Time Dilation**\n\n    The number of particles, N, remaining after a time *t* in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N = N₀ * exp(-t / T)\n\n    Where:\n    *   N₀ is the initial number of particles.\n    *   T is the lifetime of the particle *in the laboratory frame*.\n\n    Due to time dilation from special relativity, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame (T) is longer than its proper lifetime (τ), which is its lifetime in its own rest frame. The relationship is:\n    T = γ * τ\n\n    Where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n    So, the decay law becomes:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-t / (γ * τ))\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Scenario**\n\n    In the first scenario, we are given:\n    *   The fraction of particles reaching the detector (N/N₀) = 1/3.\n    *   The Lorentz factor (γ) = 20.\n    *   The distance to the detector wall (the radius) = R = 30 m.\n\n    The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector is t = R/v. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity *v* is approximately the speed of light, *c*.\n    So, t ≈ R/c.\n\n    Substituting these values into the decay equation:\n    1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20 * τ))\n\n    To solve for the unknown proper lifetime τ, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ)\n    -ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ)\n    ln(3) = (R/c) / (20 * τ)\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Scenario**\n\n    In the second scenario, we want to find the new Lorentz factor (let's call it γ') needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the wall:\n    *   The fraction of particles reaching the detector (N'/N₀) = 2/3.\n    *   The Lorentz factor = γ'.\n    *   The distance R and the proper lifetime τ remain the same.\n\n    The equation for this scenario is:\n    2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ' * τ))\n\n    Taking the natural logarithm:\n    ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ' * τ)\n    -ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ' * τ)\n    ln(3/2) = (R/c) / (γ' * τ)\n\n4.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ')**\n\n    We now have a system of two equations:\n    1) ln(3) = (R/c) / (20 * τ)\n    2) ln(3/2) = (R/c) / (γ' * τ)\n\n    Let's rearrange both equations to isolate the term (R / (c * τ)):\n    1) (R / (c * τ)) = 20 * ln(3)\n    2) (R / (c * τ)) = γ' * ln(3/2)\n\n    Since both expressions are equal to the same term, we can set them equal to each other:\n    γ' * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)\n\n    Now, solve for γ':\n    γ' = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))\n\n    Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\n    γ' ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\n    γ' ≈ 20 * 2.709\n    γ' ≈ 54.18\n\n    This value is very close to 54.\n\n    Therefore, a Lorentz factor of approximately 54 is needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector.\n\n<<<A>>>"
