    "The numerical value of \"a\" is determined by the normalization condition of the wave function. The Born rule states that the integral of the squared modulus of the wave function over all space must be equal to 1, which represents a 100% probability of finding the particle somewhere. Since the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, we only need to integrate over this interval.\n\nThe wave function is given by:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i\n\nFirst, we must find the squared modulus of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|², which represents the probability density function. For a complex function of the form z = u + vi, the squared modulus is u² + v².\n\nIn this case, the real part is u = a / sqrt(1 + x) and the imaginary part is v = -0.5.\nSo, |Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25.\n\nNext, we apply the normalization condition by integrating |Ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 and setting the result equal to 1:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can split this into two separate integrals:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫¹³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\nFor the first integral:\na² ∫¹³ (1 / (1 + x)) dx = a² [ln(1 + x)]¹³\nApplying the limits of integration, we get:\na² (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)) = a² (ln(4) - ln(2)) = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).\n\nFor the second integral:\n∫¹³ 0.25 dx = [0.25x]¹³\nApplying the limits gives:\n0.25(3) - 0.25(1) = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5.\n\nNow, we substitute these results back into the normalization equation:\na² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nSolving for a²:\na² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, we can find 'a':\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to the option 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
