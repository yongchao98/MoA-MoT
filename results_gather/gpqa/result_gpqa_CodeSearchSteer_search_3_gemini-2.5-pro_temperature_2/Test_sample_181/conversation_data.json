    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under a specific set of ideal conditions. Analyzing these conditions is key to determining the correct statement.\n\nThe foundational assumptions for the Mott-Gurney law include:\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that the current is carried by only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes.\n*   **Trap-Free:** The derivation applies to an ideal material with no trap states or energetic disorder that would capture the charge carriers. The presence of traps requires more complex models, such as the Mark-Helfrich equation.\n*   **Ohmic Contact:** For space-charge-limited current to occur, the contact must be able to inject a high concentration of carriers into the material without an energy barrier. This type of barrierless contact is called an Ohmic contact. A Schottky contact, which has an energy barrier, would limit current injection and is not suitable.\n*   **Drift-Dominated Current:** The model assumes that the current is overwhelmingly due to carriers drifting under the influence of the applied electric field. Current caused by the diffusion of carriers (due to concentration gradients) is considered negligible. While diffusion is always present, the Mott-Gurney regime is defined as being drift-dominated.\n\nBased on these points:\n*   A) is incorrect because the law is for single-carrier devices.\n*   B) is incorrect because the current is a drift current; it cannot be negligible.\n*   D) is incorrect because a Schottky contact has a carrier injection barrier, whereas an Ohmic contact is required.\n*   C) correctly combines all the key assumptions: it is a single-carrier device, it is trap-free, it has a contact with no injection barrier (an Ohmic contact), and the diffusion current is negligible.\n\n<<<C>>>"
