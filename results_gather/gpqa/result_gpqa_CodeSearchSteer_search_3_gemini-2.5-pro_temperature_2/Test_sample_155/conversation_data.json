    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and chromatographic separation:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The treatment of an alkene with a peroxyacid like m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) results in an epoxidation reaction. For (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans and symmetrically substituted alkene, this syn-addition creates a trans-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction produces an equal mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-diepropyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-diepropyloxirane. This mixture is known as a racemic mixture.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) leads to the ring-opening of the epoxide to form a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups). This is an anti-addition process, meaning the nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the epoxide's oxygen atom. The reaction is stereospecific. For a trans-alkene that undergoes anti-dihydroxylation (which is the net result of this two-step process), the product is a meso compound. A meso compound is a molecule that contains chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**, a single meso compound.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis and symmetrically substituted alkene. Epoxidation (a syn-addition) of this alkene produces the corresponding cis-epoxide, which is a meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-diepropyloxirane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The acid-catalyzed ring opening of this meso-epoxide is an anti-addition. For a cis-alkene undergoing anti-dihydroxylation, the result is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. Therefore, Reaction 2 produces an equal mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound and the two enantiomers are all diastereomers of each other.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n*   **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   Therefore, the enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-diol) will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers, such as the meso compound and the enantiomeric pair, have different physical properties and will be separated by the column.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomers.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column uses a chiral stationary phase to create a chiral environment. This allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer, leading to their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be resolved and appear as a distinct peak.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>"
