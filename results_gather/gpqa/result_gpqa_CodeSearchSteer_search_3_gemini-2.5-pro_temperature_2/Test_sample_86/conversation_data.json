    "To identify the correct ¹H NMR data, let's deduce the structure of the compound from the given information.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Core Structure**: The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring, C₆) and a total of 8 carbon atoms. This means the two substituents together contribute 2 carbon atoms (8 total C - 6 ring C = 2 C).\n\n2.  **Functional Groups**: The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. An aromatic-halogen bond means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Structure**:\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the carbonyl group and the remaining two carbon atoms. The most common and stable group that fits this description is the acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the molecular structure of a haloacetophenone: X-C₆H₄-COCH₃. This structure satisfies all the initial conditions: a di-substituted benzene ring, 8 total carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the ¹H NMR Data Options**: We now need to determine which set of data matches the spectrum of a haloacetophenone. The substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) on the benzene ring will influence the signals of the aromatic protons.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) protons of the acetyl group are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a single sharp peak (a singlet), integrating to 3 hydrogens. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl is typically around δ 2.3–2.6 ppm.\n    *   The four protons on the benzene ring will have signals in the aromatic region (typically δ 7.0–8.0 ppm). The pattern of these signals depends on the positions of the two substituents. A para (1,4) substitution pattern results in a high degree of symmetry, which simplifies the spectrum to two distinct signals, each appearing as a doublet and integrating to 2 protons. Ortho and meta substitution would produce more complex patterns.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options**:\n    *   **A) δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s):** The peak at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **B) δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s):** This spectrum lacks signals in the aromatic proton region (δ 6.5-8.0 ppm), which is inconsistent with an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **C) δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s):** This option only shows one aromatic proton, whereas the structure must have four. This is incorrect.\n    *   **D) δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s):** This spectrum is a perfect match for a para-substituted haloacetophenone.\n        *   The signal at **δ 2.3 (3H, s)** corresponds to the three protons of the acetyl methyl group.\n        *   The two signals at **δ 7.8 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.6 (2H, d)** represent the four protons on the para-substituted aromatic ring. This symmetrical pattern of two doublets is characteristic of 1,4-disubstitution. For example, the ¹H NMR spectrum of 4-bromoacetophenone shows a singlet at δ 2.57 ppm and two doublets in the aromatic region at δ 7.82 and δ 7.61 ppm. Similarly, 4-chloroacetophenone shows a singlet at δ 2.59 ppm and doublets at δ 7.90 and δ 7.44 ppm. The values in option D are consistent with these known compounds.\n\nTherefore, the ¹H NMR data in option D correctly identifies the compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
