    "The search results confirm the general principles used in the calculation. Specifically:\n- A stability constant (Kstab) quantifies the stability of a complex in solution and is the equilibrium constant for its formation.\n- The formula for the overall stability constant βn is βn = [MLn]/([M][L]ⁿ).\n- To find the concentration or percentage of a specific complex species in a solution at equilibrium, one can use the total metal concentration, the ligand concentration, and the stability constants. The fraction of a particular species MLn is given by its concentration [MLn] divided by the total metal concentration C_M.\n- This fraction (α_n) can be calculated as: αn = (βn * [L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βi * [L]ⁱ)), where the sum is from i=1 to N (the maximum number of ligands). This matches the formula I derived.\n- The search results also show that the stability constants for Co(II)-thiocyanate complexes can vary depending on the solvent and other conditions. However, the problem provides the specific stability constants to be used, so I must use those values.\n\nThe calculation performed was:\n1. Define the system and the goal: Calculate the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] in a solution containing Co(II) and SCN⁻.\n2. The fraction of the target species (α₂) is given by the formula:\n   α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n3. Substitute the given values: [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16.\n4. Calculate the denominator (S):\n   S = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\n   S = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\n   S = 2.3646\n5. Calculate the numerator:\n   Numerator = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n6. Calculate the fraction α₂:\n   α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n7. Convert to percentage:\n   Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and confirmed by chemical principles. The result directly matches option A. I am confident in this answer.\n\nTo calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, among all cobalt-containing species, we need to determine the fraction of this specific complex relative to the total concentration of all cobalt species in the solution.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free cobalt ion and all its thiocyanate complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, and the thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN⁻]`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nBy substituting these into the total concentration equation, we can factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions from above, the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving an equation that depends only on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1` M\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40`\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of each term in the denominator (let's call the sum 'S'):\n*   `1`\n*   `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nSumming these terms for the denominator:\n`S = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term for the dithiocyanato complex:\n`Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\n\nNow, we can calculate the fraction α₂:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.92%`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
