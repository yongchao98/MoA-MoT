    "This problem is a direct application of the relativistic velocity addition formula, which is a cornerstone of Einstein's special theory of relativity. Here's how to determine the correct speed:\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n*   **The Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's stationary frame of reference.\n*   **The Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference moving along with the glass at a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory.\n\n**2. Determine the Velocities:**\n*   **Speed of the glass relative to the lab:** This is given as `v`.\n*   **Speed of light within the glass (relative to the glass):** In any medium with a refractive index `n`, the speed of light `u'` is `c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed of the light beam relative to the moving glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\nThe classical way of adding velocities (`u = v + u'`) is incorrect at relativistic speeds. The correct formula for adding collinear velocities in special relativity is:\n\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u'*v / c^2))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `u` is the speed of the object (the light beam) relative to the stationary observer (lab frame S).\n*   `u'` is the speed of the object relative to the moving frame (glass frame S').\n*   `v` is the speed of the moving frame relative to the stationary frame.\n*   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n**4. Substitute and Simplify:**\nNow, we substitute the known values (`u' = 1/n` and `c = 1`) into the formula:\n\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\nTo eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n\n`u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n`u = ( n/n + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*v/n )`\n\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches the expression given in option D. This phenomenon, where the speed of light in a moving medium is not a simple sum of the speeds, was first observed in the Fizeau experiment in 1851 and later explained by special relativity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
