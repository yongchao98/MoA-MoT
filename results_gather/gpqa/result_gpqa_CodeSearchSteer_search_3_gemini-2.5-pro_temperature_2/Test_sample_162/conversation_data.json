    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer.\n\n**Part 1: Initial Calculations**\n\n1.  **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   From the periodic table, the atomic masses are approximately: Fe = 55.85 g/mol, O = 16.00 g/mol, H = 1.01 g/mol.\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\n2.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Mass = 0.1 g\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n**Part 2: Stoichiometry and Equilibrium**\n\n1.  **Dissolution Reaction:** The strong acid provides H⁺ ions that react with the hydroxide part of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** From the stoichiometry, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n\n3.  **Equilibrium Consideration (Ksp):** To ensure all the Fe(OH)₃ dissolves, there must be enough excess H⁺ in the final solution to keep the ion product below the solubility product constant, Ksp. The dissolution equilibrium is:\n    *   Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    *   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n    *   The value of Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C varies between sources, with values around 10⁻³⁶ to 10⁻³⁹ commonly cited. A frequently used value is Ksp ≈ 2.6 x 10⁻³⁹. Let's use this value for calculation.\n\n4.  **Final Fe³⁺ Concentration:** All the Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved in the final volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ / Total Volume = 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L ≈ 9.356 x 10⁻³ M.\n\n5.  **Required OH⁻ and H⁺ Concentration:** We can now calculate the maximum [OH⁻] that can be present before Fe(OH)₃ precipitates.\n    *   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ → [OH⁻]³ = Ksp / [Fe³⁺]\n    *   [OH⁻]³ = (2.6 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.356 x 10⁻³) ≈ 2.779 x 10⁻³⁷\n    *   [OH⁻] = (2.779 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 6.525 x 10⁻¹³ M.\n\n    Now, we find the corresponding minimum concentration of H⁺ needed in the final solution using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n    *   [H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻] = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (6.525 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 0.0153 M.\n\n6.  **Calculate the pH of the Final Solution:**\n    *   pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.0153) ≈ 2.04.\n\n**Part 3: Volume of Acid Required**\n\n1.  **Total Moles of H⁺:** The total amount of H⁺ that must be added is the sum of the H⁺ that reacts and the H⁺ that remains in the solution at equilibrium.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺] * Total Volume = 0.0153 M * 0.1 L = 1.53 x 10⁻³ mol.\n    *   Total Moles of H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   Total Moles of H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) + (1.53 x 10⁻³ mol) = 4.337 x 10⁻³ mol.\n\n2.  **Volume of 0.1 M Acid:** Now we can find the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed to supply this many moles of H⁺.\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration = (4.337 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 mol/L = 0.04337 L.\n\n3.  **Convert to cm³:**\n    *   Volume = 0.04337 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ 43.37 cm³.\n\n**Re-evaluation**\nThe calculated pH of 2.04 matches option A. However, the calculated volume (43.37 cm³) does not match option A (28.05 cm³). Let's re-examine the calculation and the problem's premises.\n\nThere might be a discrepancy in the Ksp value used. Let's work backwards from the answer choices to see which one is self-consistent.\n\n**Let's test option A: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n\n1.  If pH = 2.04, then [H⁺]final = 10⁻².⁰⁴ ≈ 0.01445 M.\n2.  Moles of H⁺ remaining in 100 cm³ solution = 0.01445 M * 0.1 L = 0.001445 mol.\n3.  Moles of H⁺ from the acid = Volume * Molarity = 0.02805 L * 0.1 M = 0.002805 mol.\n4.  Moles of H⁺ reacted = Moles from acid - Moles remaining = 0.002805 - 0.001445 = 0.00136 mol.\n5.  Moles of Fe(OH)₃ that can be dissolved = Moles H⁺ (reacted) / 3 = 0.00136 / 3 ≈ 0.000453 mol.\n6.  Mass of Fe(OH)₃ dissolved = Moles * Molar Mass = 0.000453 mol * 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.048 g.\n\nThis calculation shows that 28.05 cm³ of the acid can only dissolve about 0.048 g of Fe(OH)₃, not the required 0.1 g.\n\n**Let's re-evaluate the interpretation of \"minimum volume\".**\n\nPerhaps the \"excess\" H⁺ needed to maintain the equilibrium is considered negligible compared to the stoichiometric amount. This would be an incorrect assumption in a rigorous calculation, but might be intended for a multiple-choice question.\n\nLet's assume the required moles of H⁺ are only the stoichiometric amount:\n*   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n*   Volume of acid = Moles / Concentration = (2.807 x 10⁻³) / 0.1 M = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the 28.05 cm³ in option A.\n\nIf this is the intended volume, let's calculate the resulting pH.\n*   Volume of acid used = 28.05 cm³.\n*   Total moles of H⁺ added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol.\n*   Moles of H⁺ reacted = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * (0.1 / 106.88) = 0.002807 mol.\n*   The moles added and moles reacted are virtually identical. This means there is almost no excess H⁺ left. This would imply a pH close to 7, which isn't correct because Fe³⁺ itself is a weak acid and will hydrolyze:\n    *   Fe³⁺ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺ + H⁺\n*   Let's check the pH calculation again from our initial, more rigorous attempt.\n\nOur rigorous calculation gave:\n*   pH = 2.04\n*   Volume = 43.37 cm³\n\nNone of the options match this pair. There seems to be an inconsistency in the question's provided options. However, if we are forced to choose the \"best\" option, the question can be broken into two parts:\n1.  What is the minimum volume? Based on a purely stoichiometric calculation (ignoring the excess H⁺ needed for equilibrium), the volume is ~28.07 cm³. This strongly points to option A's volume.\n2.  What is the pH? Based on a rigorous equilibrium calculation, the pH should be ~2.04. This strongly points to option A's pH.\n\nBoth the simplified volume calculation and the rigorous pH calculation independently point to the numerical values presented in option A, even though those values are not mutually consistent in a single rigorous calculation. This suggests the question was designed such that the volume is calculated stoichiometrically and the pH is calculated based on the equilibrium that would be established.\n\nTherefore, selecting the option where both calculated values appear is the most logical choice.\n\n*   Calculated Stoichiometric Volume ≈ 28.07 cm³ (matches 28.05 cm³)\n*   Calculated Equilibrium pH ≈ 2.04 (matches 2.04)\n\nThe answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
