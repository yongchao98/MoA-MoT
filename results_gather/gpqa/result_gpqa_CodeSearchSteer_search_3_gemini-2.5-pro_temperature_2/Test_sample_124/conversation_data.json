    "For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy eigenvalues are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = (n + 3/2)ħω\n\nHere, n is the principal quantum number (n = 0, 1, 2, ...), which is the sum of the quantum numbers in each of the three Cartesian coordinates (n = n_x + n_y + n_z).\n\n*   **Ground state (n=0):** This is the lowest energy level.\n*   **First excited state (n=1):** The next energy level.\n*   **Second excited state (n=2):** The level after the first excited state.\n*   **Third excited state (n=3):** This corresponds to the fourth energy level.\n\nTo find the energy of the third excited state, we set n = 3:\n\nE_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is known as the degeneracy of that level. The degeneracy (g_n) for a principal quantum number 'n' in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n\ng_n = (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2\n\nFor the third excited state, where n = 3, the degeneracy is:\n\ng_3 = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2 = (4)(5) / 2 = 10\n\nThis result can also be found by counting the possible combinations of the non-negative integers n_x, n_y, and n_z that add up to 3:\n*   (3, 0, 0) and its permutations: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states\n*   (2, 1, 0) and its permutations: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states\n*   (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) — 1 state\n\nThe total number of states is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level.\n\nBased on this, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω, and the degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<A>>>"
