    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic shift in the spectral lines of their host star. This shift is caused by the Doppler effect as the star \"wobbles\" around the common center of mass with its planet. The maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$).\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to RV Semi-Amplitude (K):**\n    The relationship is given by the Doppler formula, $\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v_r / c$, where $v_r$ is the star's radial velocity and $c$ is the speed of light. The maximum observed shift corresponds to the semi-amplitude $K$. Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\n    Given the periodic shifts for the two planets:\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Use the RV Semi-Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude $K$ is related to the orbital period ($P$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the planet's minimum mass ($M_p \\sin i$) by the following equation:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Information and Assumptions:**\n    *   The stars have the same masses: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The problem states the planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\". In the context of the RV method, which measures the minimum mass ($M_p \\sin i$), it's a standard interpretation that this refers to the measured value. Thus, we assume the minimum masses are approximately equal: $(M_p \\sin i)_1 \\approx (M_p \\sin i)_2$.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Ratio of Periods:** Let's set up a ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{(M_p \\sin i)_2}{(M_{star2})^{2/3}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{(M_p \\sin i)_1}{(M_{star1})^{2/3}}}$\n\n    Since $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$ and we assume $(M_p \\sin i)_1 \\approx (M_p \\sin i)_2$, the formula simplifies significantly:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:** We are looking for the value of $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. We can rearrange the simplified equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n    Now, substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes we found in step 2:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
