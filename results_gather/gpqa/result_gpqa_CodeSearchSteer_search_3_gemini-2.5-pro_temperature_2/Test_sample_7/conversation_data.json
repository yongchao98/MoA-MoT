  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here's a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### 1. Analyzing the Role of Gene G2\n\n*   A knockout of gene G2 (`g2`) results in a complete loss of resistance (0%). This is the most severe phenotype observed.\n*   When G2 is knocked out in combination with G1 (`g1g2`), resistance is also 0%. This means the `g2` phenotype (0% resistance) masks the `g1` phenotype (75% resistance).\n*   Similarly, when G2 is knocked out with G3 (`g2g3`), resistance is 0%, masking the `g3` phenotype (50% resistance).\n*   This masking effect is the definition of **epistasis**, where one gene's phenotype conceals the phenotype of another gene. Since the problem states that one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, and the G2 knockout has this epistatic effect on both G1 and G3, G2 is the transcription factor. It acts as a master switch for the resistance pathway.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Interaction between G1 and G3\n\n*   The `g1` single mutant has a 75% resistance level (a 25% drop from the control).\n*   The `g3` single mutant has a 50% resistance level (a 50% drop from the control).\n*   The `g1g3` double mutant has a 10% resistance level (a 90% drop from the control).\n\nTo understand their interaction, let's consider what would be expected if they acted independently. An expected additive effect would result in a resistance of 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%. The observed resistance of 10% is significantly lower than the 25% expected from a simple additive effect. This much more severe phenotype in the double mutant is a classic example of a **synergistic interaction**. This synergy suggests that the two genes likely have overlapping or compensatory functions, a concept known as **gene redundancy**. They may act in parallel pathways, both contributing to the final resistance outcome.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Answer Choices\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** G2 being a transcription factor is likely correct. However, pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be concluded from this experiment. Also, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the double mutant phenotype (10%) is different from the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This incorrectly identifies G1 as the transcription factor.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor based on its epistatic relationship. It also correctly describes the synergistic interaction between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. The third statement, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is not supported by the data in its classical definition, but the first two conclusions are strongly supported and make this the best choice among the options.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** There is no evidence from these results to conclude they share a promoter. G3 is also not epistatic towards G1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe experimental evidence most strongly supports the conclusion that G2 is an upstream transcription factor that regulates both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 function downstream of G2 and have redundant or synergistic roles in providing resistance. Option C best summarizes these key findings, despite the inaccurate final clause.\n\n<<<C>>>"
