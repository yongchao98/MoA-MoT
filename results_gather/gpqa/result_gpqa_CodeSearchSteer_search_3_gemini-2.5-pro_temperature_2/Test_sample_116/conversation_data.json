    "Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a type of substituted biphenyl. Due to the large, bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral, as its mirror images are non-superimposable. Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has the formula CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). This carbon is a chiral center, meaning the molecule exists as a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). It is the simplest chiral ester and is a common chiral building block in the pharmaceutical industry. Consequently, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone:** The structure of benzophenone (C6H5-CO-C6H5) shows a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond angle. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and thus cannot be optically active. While it can exhibit induced optical activity when complexed with chiral molecules like cyclodextrin, the benzophenone molecule itself is achiral.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. It has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) and is therefore achiral and optically inactive. Its molecular structure is non-chiral.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
