    "To determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step. The target molecule has three substituents—acetyl, bromo, and nitro—all of which are electron-withdrawing and meta-directing relative to each other (at positions 1, 3, and 5). Synthesizing this molecule directly is challenging because introducing multiple deactivating groups onto a benzene ring becomes progressively more difficult and can lead to low yields.\n\nA common strategy for synthesizing such molecules is to introduce a powerful ortho-, para-directing activating group (like an amino group, -NH2) to control the position of other substituents, and then remove this directing group in a final step. The inclusion of reduction (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) steps in the options suggests this is the intended strategy.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n*   **A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n    Steps (i) through (iv) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, which is then converted to a diazonium salt and finally deaminated back to benzene. This sequence results in no net change and is therefore an illogical synthetic pathway.\n\n*   **B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    Following an initial acylation and bromination to form 3-bromoacetophenone, step (iii) is nitration. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is meta-directing (to position 5), but the bromo group (-Br) is ortho-, para-directing (to positions 2, 4, 6). This would lead to a mixture of products, not a high yield of the desired isomer. Furthermore, if the desired product were formed in step (iii), the subsequent steps would be unnecessary.\n\n*   **D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    Step (i) produces bromobenzene, and step (ii) produces a mixture of ortho- and para-nitrobromobenzene. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those containing a nitro group. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This sequence follows a logical synthetic design:\n    1.  **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene:** Standard nitration.\n    2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline:** The nitro group is reduced to a strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing amino group (-NH2).\n    3.  **iii) Aniline → 4-Aminoacetophenone:** A Friedel-Crafts acylation is performed. The amino group is a powerful ortho-, para-director, leading to the acetyl group adding primarily at the para position. (This step technically requires protection of the amine, but the outcome is the major product).\n    4.  **iv) 4-Aminoacetophenone → 1-(4-Amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone:** Now, the ring is brominated. The powerful activating amino group directs the incoming bromine to one of its ortho positions (position 3), which is also meta to the acetyl group.\n    5.  **v) 1-(4-Amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone → 1-(4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone:** The ring is nitrated. The directing effects of the substituents are crucial here. The amino group (at C4) is a powerful ortho-director (to C3-blocked, and C5). The acetyl group (at C1) is a meta-director (to C3-blocked, and C5). Both strongly favor substitution at position 5.\n    6.  **vi) & vii) → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The amino group at position 4 has served its purpose of directing the substituents. It is now removed via diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) followed by deamination (H3PO2), where it is replaced by a hydrogen atom. This yields the final target molecule.\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound and employs a standard tactic to achieve a difficult substitution pattern with high yield.\n\n<<<C>>>"
