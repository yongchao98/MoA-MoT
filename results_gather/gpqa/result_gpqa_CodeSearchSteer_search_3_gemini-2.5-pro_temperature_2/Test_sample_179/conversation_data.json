    "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the total electrostatic potential energy. The system consists of two parts: a central charge at point P and 12 charges constrained to a spherical surface of radius R around P.\n\n1.  **Identify the components of the total energy:**\n    The total potential energy (U_total) is the sum of:\n    *   The potential energy of interaction between the central charge (q_p) and the 12 charges on the sphere (q_s). Let's call this U_ps.\n    *   The potential energy of interaction among the 12 charges on the sphere. Let's call this U_ss.\n\n2.  **Determine the configuration for minimum energy:**\n    For the 12 charges on the sphere to have minimum potential energy, they must arrange themselves in a configuration that maximizes their mutual distances. This is a classic problem in physics known as the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the solution is that they are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\n3.  **Define the constants and variables:**\n    *   The charge of each particle is `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge.\n        *   `e ≈ 1.602176634 × 10^-19` C\n        *   `q = 2 * 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C = 3.204353268 × 10^-19 C`\n    *   The radius of the sphere is `R = 2` m.\n    *   The electrostatic constant (Coulomb's constant) is `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²`.\n    *   The general formula for electrostatic potential energy between two charges is `U = k * (q1*q2) / r`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 shell charges (U_ps):**\n    Each of the 12 charges on the sphere is at a distance `R` from the central charge. The potential energy for each pair is `k * q^2 / R`. Since there are 12 such pairs, the total energy for this part is:\n    `U_ps = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n    `U_ps = 12 * (8.98755 × 10^9 * (3.204353268 × 10^-19)^2 / 2)`\n    `U_ps = 12 * (4.6143 × 10^-28) J ≈ 5.537 × 10^-27 J`\n\n5.  **Calculate the potential energy of the 12 charges on the sphere (U_ss):**\n    The 12 charges form an icosahedron. To find their total interaction energy, we must sum the potential energy for all unique pairs of charges. In an icosahedron, there are three distinct distances between vertices. For an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R:\n    *   There are 30 pairs of adjacent vertices separated by a distance `d1`.\n    *   There are 30 pairs of vertices separated by a distance `d2`.\n    *   There are 6 pairs of opposite vertices separated by a distance `d3 = 2R`.\n\n    The distances `d1` and `d2` for a sphere of radius `R` are:\n    *   `d1 = R * sqrt(2 - 2/sqrt(5)) ≈ 2 * 1.05146 m = 2.10292 m`\n    *   `d2 = R * sqrt(2 + 2/sqrt(5)) ≈ 2 * 1.70130 m = 3.40260 m`\n    *   `d3 = 2 * 2 m = 4 m`\n\n    The total potential energy of the shell is the sum of energies for all pairs:\n    `U_ss = 30 * (k * q^2 / d1) + 30 * (k * q^2 / d2) + 6 * (k * q^2 / d3)`\n    We can factor out `k * q^2`:\n    `U_ss = k * q^2 * (30/d1 + 30/d2 + 6/d3)`\n    `U_ss = (8.98755 × 10^9 * (3.204353268 × 10^-19)^2) * (30/2.10292 + 30/3.40260 + 6/4)`\n    `U_ss = (9.2286 × 10^-28) * (14.266 + 8.816 + 1.5)`\n    `U_ss = (9.2286 × 10^-28) * (24.582) ≈ 2.2696 × 10^-26 J`\n\n6.  **Calculate the total minimum energy:**\n    `U_total = U_ps + U_ss`\n    `U_total = 5.537 × 10^-27 J + 2.2696 × 10^-26 J`\n    `U_total = 0.5537 × 10^-26 J + 2.2696 × 10^-26 J`\n    `U_total ≈ 2.8233 × 10^-26 J`\n\n    This value is extremely close to the provided option D. The minor difference is likely due to the precision of the physical constants used.\n\n    `2.8233 × 10^-26` J rounded to three decimal places is `2.823 x 10^-26` J. Comparing with the options, option D is the clear choice.\n\nFinal answer is `2.822 x 10^-26 J`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
