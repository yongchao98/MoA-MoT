    "### System Analysis\n\nThe problem asks for the energies of the ground state, the first excited state, and the second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. These particles are fermions, as they have spin-1/2.\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n`En = n^2 * (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines the ground state energy unit `E` as:\n`E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`\n\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as `En = n^2 * E`.\n*   **E1:** `1^2 * E = 1E`\n*   **E2:** `2^2 * E = 4E`\n*   **E3:** `3^2 * E = 9E`\n*   **E4:** `4^2 * E = 16E`\n\n### Particle Configuration\n\nSince the particles are identical fermions (spin-1/2), they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by its set of quantum numbers, which in this case are the energy level `n` and the spin projection `ms` (+1/2 or -1/2). This means each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### Energy Calculation\n\n1.  **Ground State Energy:**\n    To achieve the lowest possible total energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n    *   Two particles occupy the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is `2 * E1 = 2 * (1E) = 2E`.\n    *   The remaining two particles occupy the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is `2 * E2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E`.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: `2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n2.  **First Excited State Energy:**\n    To find the energy of the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n    *   The configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy is the sum: `(2 * E1) + (1 * E2) + (1 * E3) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n3.  **Second Excited State Energy:**\n    For the second excited state, we must consider the next lowest energy configurations. There are three primary possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n    *   **Possibility A:** Promote a particle from `n=1` to the lowest empty level `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: One particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy: `(1 * E1) + (2 * E2) + (1 * E3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in `n=1`, zero in `n=2`, and two in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy: `(2 * E1) + (2 * E3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=4`.\n        *   Energy: `(2 * E1) + (1 * E2) + (1 * E4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing these possibilities, the lowest energy for the second excitation is 18E.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies for the states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
