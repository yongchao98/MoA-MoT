    "Based on the reaction scheme and provided hints, we can deduce the structure of compound E through the following steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Compound A:** Hint (a) describes a Wittig reaction between compound A and a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The Wittig reaction converts a carbonyl group (C=O) into a carbon-carbon double bond. The ylide is derived from isopropylidene (`(CH₃)₂C=`), meaning the C=O group of compound A is replaced by `C=C(CH₃)₂`. The product's name indicates that the double bond is at position 4 of a 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane ring. Therefore, compound A must be **3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one**.\n\n2.  **Confirm Structure A with IR Data:** Hint (b) states that the IR spectrum of compound A has a strong absorption peak around 1750 cm⁻¹. This frequency is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration in a five-membered ring ketone (cyclopentanone), which is higher than that of acyclic or six-membered ring ketones due to ring strain. This confirms that compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative.\n\n3.  **Trace the Reactions:**\n    *   **A → B:** Compound A (3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one) reacts with HCN. This is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group, forming a cyanohydrin. Compound B is **1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentane-1-carbonitrile**.\n    *   **B → C:** Compound B is reduced with H₂/Pd. The nitrile group (-CN) is reduced to a primary amine (-CH₂NH₂). Compound C is **1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol**.\n    *   **C → D → E:** Compound C reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂) in what is known as the **Tiffeneau–Demjanov rearrangement**. The primary amine group reacts with HNO₂ to form an unstable diazonium salt (D), which then loses nitrogen gas (N₂). This process generates a carbocation that prompts a rearrangement. The carbon-carbon bond in the cyclopentane ring migrates, leading to a ring expansion from a five-membered ring to a six-membered ring. This one-carbon ring expansion is a characteristic outcome of this reaction. The initial five-membered ring of 3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone expands to a six-membered ring. The methyl groups at positions 3 and 4 of the original ring remain on the same carbon atoms relative to the newly formed ring structure. This results in the formation of **3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one** as Compound E.\n\n4.  **Confirm Structure E with IR Data:** Hint (b) indicates that Compound E shows a strong IR peak around 1715 cm⁻¹. This absorption frequency is characteristic of a carbonyl group in a six-membered ring ketone (cyclohexanone). This supports the conclusion that a ring expansion has occurred, transforming the five-membered ring of compound A into the six-membered ring of compound E.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, compound E is identified as 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n<<<B>>>"
