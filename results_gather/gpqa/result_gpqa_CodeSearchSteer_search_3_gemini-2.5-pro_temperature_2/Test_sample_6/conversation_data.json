    "The physical process in question is pair production, where two photons annihilate to create an electron-positron pair ($\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$). This process has a minimum energy requirement known as the threshold energy. For the reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two photons must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron and positron combined.\n\nThe key steps to determine this threshold energy are as follows:\n*   **Rest Energy**: The rest mass of an electron ($m_e$) is approximately 0.511 MeV/cÂ². Since a positron has the same mass, the minimum energy required to create the pair is $2 \\times m_e c^2$, which equals 1.022 MeV.\n*   **Collision Kinematics**: The threshold energy for the incoming high-energy gamma-ray is minimized when it has a head-on collision with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon.\n*   **Threshold Condition**: In a head-on collision, the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) can be calculated using the formula:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n    where $m_e c^2$ is the rest energy of the electron and $E_{CMB}$ is the energy of the CMB photon.\n*   **Calculation**: Given the values:\n    *   $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n    *   $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    The threshold energy is calculated as:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\n*   **Unit Conversion**: To compare with the given options, we convert the energy from electronvolts (eV) to giga-electronvolts (GeV), where 1 GeV = $10^9$ eV:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.2611 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV} \\approx 2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis calculated energy of approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV is the minimum energy a gamma-ray must have for its lifetime in the universe to be limited by pair production with CMB photons. Above this energy, the universe becomes increasingly opaque to gamma rays over cosmological distances.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 3.9*1e5 GeV\nB) 1.8*1e5 GeV\nC) 2.6*1e5 GeV\nD) 9.5*1e4 GeV\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
