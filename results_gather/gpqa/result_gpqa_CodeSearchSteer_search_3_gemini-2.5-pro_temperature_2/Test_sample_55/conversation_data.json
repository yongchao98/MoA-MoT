    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two electric dipole transitions follows specific quantum mechanical selection rules. This process is a cascade decay, where the atom first transitions to an intermediate state and then to the final state.\n\n### Transition Route\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   **Δl = ±1** (change in orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1** (change in magnetic quantum number)\n\n1.  **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has *l* = 0. According to the selection rule Δl = ±1, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n    *   The principal quantum number *n* must decrease, so a transition to *n'*=2 is allowed.\n    *   The initial state has *m* = 0. The selection rule Δm = 0, ±1 allows the intermediate state to have *m'* = 0, +1, or -1.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   From any of the intermediate states with *l'* = 1, a transition to the final state with *l* = 0 is allowed (Δl = -1).\n    *   From $|2,1,0\\rangle$: Δm = 0 - 0 = 0. Allowed.\n    *   From $|2,1,1\\rangle$: Δm = 0 - 1 = -1. Allowed.\n    *   From $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: Δm = 0 - (-1) = +1. Allowed.\n\nAll three cascade routes are possible:\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe problem now is to determine the probability of each specific decay path. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. Due to the isotropic nature of space, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three possible intermediate *m'* sublevels of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state (the 2p orbital).\n\nThis can be shown more formally using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which separates the transition matrix element into a radial part and an angular part (a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient). For a transition from an *l*=0 state to *l*=1 states, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are equal for all possible *m'* values (-1, 0, +1). Since the transition probability is proportional to the square of this matrix element, the probabilities of landing in any of the $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$ states are identical.\n\nTherefore, the total probability of 1 is split equally among the three possible intermediate states. The probability for the atom to take any one specific route is 1/3.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: Incorrect probability.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: Incorrect probability.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: Incorrect probability.\n\nThus, the only option that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
