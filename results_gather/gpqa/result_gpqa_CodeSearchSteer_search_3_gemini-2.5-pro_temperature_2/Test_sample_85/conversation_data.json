    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the selectivity of the two reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and borane (BH3), when reacting with a dicarboxylic acid monoester, and how the stereochemistry of the starting material relates to that of the lactone product.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n\n1.  **Reducing Agent Selectivity**:\n    *   **Lithium borohydride (LiBH4)** is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Borane (BH3)**, often used as a complex with THF or dimethyl sulfide, is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids over esters.\n\n2.  **Starting Material**: The options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, an isobutyl ester group, and a chiral center at the third carbon (C3).\n\n3.  **Product Formation**: Both reactions produce a 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered cyclic ester (a Î´-lactone). This lactone forms from an intermediate, 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, through an intramolecular esterification (lactonization).\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry**: The reduction of the carbonyl group (either ester or carboxylic acid) does not occur at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the original stereochemistry at C3 of the starting material is retained in the intermediate and the final lactone product. The chiral center at C3 of the starting acid becomes the chiral center at C4 of the lactone.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions:\n\n**Reaction A:**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Starting material **A** + LiBH4\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** Since LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester, the isobutyl ester group of compound **A** will be reduced to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group will remain intact.\n    *   `A (HOOC-R-COO-isobutyl) --(LiBH4)--> HOOC-R-CH2OH`\n*   The resulting intermediate is a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. Upon acid workup (H+), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form the lactone.\n*   Because the reaction does not affect the chiral center, the stereochemistry is conserved. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A** must have the (R) configuration.\n*   Therefore, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Starting material **B** + BH3\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group untouched.\n    *   `B (HOOC-R-COO-isobutyl) --(BH3)--> HO-CH2-R-COO-isobutyl`\n*   The resulting intermediate is a hydroxy-ester. Upon acid workup (H+), this undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone and isobutanol.\n*   Again, the reaction does not affect the chiral center, so the stereochemistry is conserved. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B** must have the (S) configuration.\n*   Therefore, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the selective nature of the reducing agents and the conservation of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
