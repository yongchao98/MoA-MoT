    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the chemical reaction taking place.\n\n### 1. The Reactant and Reagents\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\nThis combination of Red P and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is capable of reducing a wide variety of functional groups to simple alkanes.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\nThe key functional groups in the starting molecule that will react are:\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH).\n*   The **formyl** (aldehyde) group (-CHO).\n*   The carbon-carbon **double bond** in the cyclohexene ring.\n*   The carbon-carbon **double bond** in the vinyl group.\n\nThe Red P/HI mixture will reduce all of these functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acids are reduced to alkanes (R-COOH → R-CH₃).\n*   Aldehydes are also reduced to alkanes (R-CHO → R-CH₃).\n*   Alkenes (carbon-carbon double bonds) are reduced to alkanes (C=C → C-C).\n\n### 3. Determining the Product\nLet's analyze the starting molecule's structure and predict the product:\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Its molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n*   **Reaction Process:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid at position 1 becomes a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The formyl group at position 2 becomes a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The double bond in the ring (at position 3) is saturated to a single bond.\n    *   The double bond in the vinyl group at position 5 is saturated, converting the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) into an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Product:** The resulting molecule is 1,2-dimethyl-4-ethylcyclohexane. All double bonds and oxygen-containing groups have been removed and reduced to a saturated hydrocarbon structure.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for a hydrocarbon (CₓHᵧ) is:\n\n**IHD = x - (y/2) + 1**\n\nFirst, we need the molecular formula of the product, **1,2-dimethyl-4-ethylcyclohexane**.\n*   Carbons (C): 6 (in the ring) + 1 (methyl at C1) + 1 (methyl at C2) + 2 (ethyl at C4) = 10 carbons.\n*   A saturated monocyclic alkane has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Therefore, for our C₁₀ product, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nNow, we can calculate the IHD for the product (C₁₀H₂₀):\n*   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n*   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n*   **IHD = 1**\n\nThe IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring present in the cyclohexane structure. The molecule is otherwise completely saturated, with no double or triple bonds.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
