    "The initial theoretical calculation appears to be robust and confirmed by the search results. I will lay out the step-by-step calculation to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Amplitude of Brightness Variation due to Starspots**\n\nThe variation in brightness is caused by the rotation of the star, which alternately shows its unspotted and spotted hemispheres. The amplitude of this variation is the normalized difference between the maximum and minimum flux.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the completely unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's photospheric effective temperature (T_eff) to the fourth power, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n    `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This happens when the spotted hemisphere is in view. A fraction of this hemisphere, given by the filling factor (f_spot), is covered by cooler spots. The remaining fraction `(1 - f_spot)` is at the normal photospheric temperature.\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`\n\nThe key parameters are:\n*   Photospheric effective temperature (T_eff) = 6000 K\n*   Spot filling factor (f_spot) = 20% = 0.20\n*   Spot temperature (T_spot) = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\nThe amplitude of the signal (Amp) is calculated as:\n`Amp = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n`Amp = [T_eff⁴ - ((1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴`\n`Amp = [T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴`\n`Amp = f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\nNow, plugging in the numerical values:\n`Amp = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]`\n`Amp = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]`\n`Amp = 0.20 * [1 - 625 / 1296]`\n`Amp = 0.20 * [ (1296 - 625) / 1296 ]`\n`Amp = 0.20 * [ 671 / 1296 ]`\n`Amp ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775`\n`Amp ≈ 0.10355`\n\nSo, the rotational modulation due to the starspots causes a brightness variation with an amplitude of approximately 10.36%.\n\n### **Step 2: Relate Brightness Variation to a Hypothetical Exoplanet Transit**\n\nThe signal from an exoplanet transit is the fractional dip in the star's brightness, known as the transit depth. This depth is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n*   Transit Depth = (Area of planet) / (Area of star)\n*   Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n*   Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nWhere `R_pl` is the radius of the planet and `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n\n### **Step 3: Equate the Signals and Solve for the Planet's Relative Radius**\n\nTo find the size of the planet that would produce the same amplitude signal, we set the transit depth equal to the amplitude of the starspot variation.\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = Amp`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\nNow, we solve for the ratio `R_pl / R_star` by taking the square root of the amplitude.\n`R_pl / R_star = √0.10355`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated relative radius matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
