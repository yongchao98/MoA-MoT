    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus.\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Properties**\nThe problem specifies the nucleus X as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium has an atomic number (Z) of 3, meaning it contains 3 protons.\n*   The number of neutrons is given as 3.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li).\n\n**2. Find the Rest Energy of the Nucleus ($E_0$)**\nTo find the total energy, we first need the rest energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$). The mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of its individual protons and neutrons due to the nuclear binding energy.\n*   One source provides the calculated nuclear mass of Lithium-6 as 6.0134771 u.\n*   Alternatively, the nuclear binding energy per nucleon for $^{6}$Li is 5.33233073 MeV.\n*   The total binding energy is the binding energy per nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons (6): $6 \\times 5.33233073 \\text{ MeV} = 31.99398438 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nWe can calculate the rest mass energy from the masses of the constituents and the binding energy:\n*   Mass of 3 protons = $3 \\times 938.272 \\text{ MeV/c}^2 = 2814.816 \\text{ MeV/c}^2$\n*   Mass of 3 neutrons = $3 \\times 939.565 \\text{ MeV/c}^2 = 2818.695 \\text{ MeV/c}^2$\n*   Total mass of constituents = $2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 \\text{ MeV/c}^2$\n\nThe rest energy of the nucleus is the total mass energy of the constituents minus the binding energy.\n*   $E_0 = (5633.511 \\text{ MeV}) - (31.994 \\text{ MeV}) = 5601.517 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Converting to GeV: $E_0 = 5.601517 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe nucleus is traveling at a speed (v) of 0.96c. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}}$\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.571428$\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\nThe total energy (E) is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy.\n*   $E = \\gamma \\times E_0$\n*   $E = 3.571428 \\times 5.601517 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $E \\approx 20.0054 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 20.132 GeV\nB) 23.069 GeV\nC) 21.419 GeV\nD) 18.475 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 20.0054 GeV is closest to option A. The minor difference might stem from using slightly different values for the proton/neutron masses or a more precise value for the binding energy not fully captured in the source. Let's re-calculate using the mass excess value, which can be more direct. The mass excess for $^{6}$Li is 14.08688 MeV.\nRest Energy $E_0 = A \\times \\text{amu} + \\text{Mass Excess}$\n$E_0 = (6 \\times 931.494 \\text{ MeV}) + 14.08688 \\text{ MeV} = 5588.964 \\text{ MeV} + 14.08688 \\text{ MeV} = 5603.05 \\text{ MeV} = 5.60305 \\text{ GeV}$. This is the atomic rest energy.\n$E = 3.571428 \\times 5.60305 \\text{ GeV} \\approx 20.0108 \\text{ GeV}$. This result is still very close to 20.0054 GeV and points towards option A. Let's consider a slight variation in speed that might account for the value 20.132 GeV. Or it might be that the energy per nucleon is what is usually quoted in accelerators. RHIC can accelerate gold ions up to 100 GeV/nucleon and protons up to 250 GeV. The total energy depends on the nucleus.\n\nLet's assume the energy in option A is correct and work backward to find the implied rest energy.\n$E_0 = E / \\gamma = 20.132 \\text{ GeV} / 3.571428 \\approx 5.636 \\text{ GeV}$.\nThis implies a rest mass of approximately $6.05 \\text{ u}$, which corresponds to the approximate mass from adding protons and neutrons without considering binding energy. Let's use the nucleon approximation.\n$E_0 \\approx 6 \\times 0.938 \\text{ GeV} = 5.628 \\text{ GeV}$.\n$E = 3.571428 \\times 5.628 \\text{ GeV} \\approx 20.099 \\text{ GeV}$. This value is extremely close to option A. The slight discrepancy to 20.132 GeV (a difference of about 0.16%) is likely due to the precise mass values and constants used in the problem's formulation. Given the options, this approximation strongly supports A.\n\nFinal check of calculation:\n$E_0$ (precise) = 5.6015 GeV\n$\\gamma$ (for 0.96c) = 3.5714\n$E = 5.6015 \\times 3.5714 = 20.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n$E_0$ (approx. nucleons) = 5.628 GeV\n$E = 5.628 \\times 3.5714 = 20.099 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nBoth calculations point decisively to option A as being the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
