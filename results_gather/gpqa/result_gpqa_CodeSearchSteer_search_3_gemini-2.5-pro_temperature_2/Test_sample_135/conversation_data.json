    "The problem asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, ∫(∇⋅f)dV, within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and is directed radially outward. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as **f** = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the radial unit vector.\n\n**Applying the Divergence Theorem**\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of **f** in spherical coordinates for r ≠ 0 gives:\n∇⋅f = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (r² * (1/r²)) = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (1) = 0.\nIf we were to integrate this null result over the volume of the sphere, we would get an answer of 0. However, this is incorrect because it fails to account for the singularity of the vector field at the origin (r=0), where the field is undefined.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem provides an alternative and more robust method. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field within a volume V to the flux of that field across the closed surface S that encloses V:\n\n∫V (∇⋅f) dV = ∮S (**f** ⋅ **dS**)\n\nHere, the volume V is the sphere of radius R, and the enclosing surface S is the surface of this sphere.\n\n**Calculating the Flux**\n\nTo find the solution, we can calculate the flux of the field **f** through the spherical surface of radius R.\n\n1.  **The vector field at the surface:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius r is equal to R. So, the vector field is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n2.  **The differential surface element:** For a sphere of radius R, the differential surface area element **dS** is directed radially outward and is given by **dS** = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**, where θ is the polar angle and φ is the azimuthal angle.\n3.  **The dot product:** The dot product of the field and the surface element is **f** ⋅ **dS** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ [R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**]. Since **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1, this simplifies to sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n4.  **The surface integral (Flux):** We integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the polar angle θ are 0 to π, and for the azimuthal angle φ are 0 to 2π.\n\n    Flux = ∫[φ=0 to 2π] ∫[θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\n    The integral of sin(θ) with respect to θ from 0 to π is [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = -(-1) - (-1) = 2.\n    The integral of dφ with respect to φ from 0 to 2π is [φ] from 0 to 2π = 2π.\n\n    Multiplying these results gives the total flux:\n    Flux = 2π * 2 = 4π.\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, this flux is equal to the volume integral of the divergence. The singularity at the origin acts as a source, and the integral correctly accounts for the strength of this source. This is a well-known result in vector calculus and physics, particularly in the context of Gauss's Law for a point charge. Therefore, the value of the integral is 4π.\n\n<<<C>>>"
