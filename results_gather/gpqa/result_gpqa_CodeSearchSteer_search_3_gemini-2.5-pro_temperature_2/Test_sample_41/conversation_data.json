    "To determine by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can follow a two-step calculation involving the relationship between equilibrium temperature, semi-major axis, and orbital period.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet and its semi-major axis (a). The equilibrium temperature is determined by the balance of energy absorbed from the host star and the energy radiated away. For planets orbiting the same star, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (T_eq ∝ 1/√a). The information about the albedo being equal for all planets is crucial for this direct relationship, although its specific value of 0.3 is not needed for the calculation.\n\nGiven the temperature ratios:\n*   T_eq(Planet1) / T_eq(Planet2) ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq(Planet2) / T_eq(Planet3) ≈ 2.3\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n*   a2 / a1 ≈ (1.4)² = 1.96\n*   a3 / a2 ≈ (2.3)² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axis of Planet3 to Planet1, we multiply these intermediate ratios:\n*   a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.3684\n\nSecond, we use Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (P² ∝ a³). The mass ratios provided are extraneous information, as planetary masses are typically negligible compared to the host star's mass in such calculations.\n\nUsing Kepler's Third Law, we can find the ratio of the orbital periods:\n*   (P3 / P1)² = (a3 / a1)³\n*   (P3 / P1)² ≈ (10.3684)³ ≈ 1114.65\n*   P3 / P1 ≈ √1114.65 ≈ 33.386\n\nAlternatively, a more direct relationship can be derived between the orbital period and equilibrium temperature. Since P ∝ a^(3/2) and a ∝ T_eq⁻², it follows that P ∝ (T_eq⁻²)^(3/2), which simplifies to P ∝ T_eq⁻³.\n\nFirst, we find the temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet3:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) ≈ 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\nThen, we use the derived relationship to find the period ratio:\n*   P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³ ≈ (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386\n\nBoth methods yield a result of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
