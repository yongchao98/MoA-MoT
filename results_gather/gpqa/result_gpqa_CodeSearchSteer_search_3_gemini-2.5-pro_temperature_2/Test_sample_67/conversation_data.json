    "This is a classic problem in quantum mechanics describing the phenomenon of Larmor precession. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, and its magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the \"spin up\" eigenstate with respect to the Z-axis, denoted as `|+z>`.\n\n2.  **Change in Hamiltonian:** At time t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude, B. The Hamiltonian of the system, which describes its energy, is given by `H = -μ ⋅ B`, where `μ` is the magnetic moment operator and `B` is the magnetic field vector.\n    *   The magnetic moment operator is proportional to the spin operator `S`, related by the gyromagnetic ratio `γ`: `μ = γS`.\n    *   For t > 0, the new Hamiltonian is `H = -γS_yB`, where `S_y` is the y-component of the spin operator.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The initial state `|+z>` is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. Therefore, the state will evolve in time. The spin vector begins to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession.\n\n4.  **Larmor Frequency:** The angular frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency, `ω`, and it is directly proportional to the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` and the magnitude of the magnetic field `B`. The formula is:\n    `ω = γB`\n\n5.  **Oscillation of the Z-Component:** As the magnetic moment vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will change over time. This projection, `<μ_z>`, which is the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<S_z>`, can be calculated to vary as `cos(γBt)`. Consequently, the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z> = γ<S_z>`, also oscillates with an angular frequency of `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
