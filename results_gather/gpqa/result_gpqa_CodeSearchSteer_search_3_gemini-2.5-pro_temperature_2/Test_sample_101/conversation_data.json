    "### Detailed analysis of the options:\n\n*   **A) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:** The construct uses the Chicken Î²-actin (CBA) promoter. The CBA promoter is a strong, ubiquitous promoter that drives high levels of gene expression in many cell types in transgenic mice. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that expression failure is due to a missing enhancer.\n\n*   **B) The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:** This is a highly probable cause. The construct design is `Receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP`. For a functional Receptor-eGFP fusion protein to be produced, two events must happen correctly: 1) The SOX10-driven Cre recombinase must recognize and excise the lox2272-flanked stop cassette. 2) After excision, the open reading frame (ORF) of the receptor must be continuous with the ORF of eGFP. A frameshift error is a common mistake in molecular cloning where the addition or deletion of base pairs not divisible by three shifts the triplet reading frame. If the receptor and eGFP are out of frame, the ribosome would translate the receptor correctly, but then produce a garbled, non-functional amino acid sequence from the eGFP region, likely hitting a premature stop codon and failing to produce a fluorescent protein. The preliminary Western blot in astrocytes without Cre would only confirm the expression of the receptor protein itself, not the fused eGFP which is blocked by the stop cassette. Therefore, the experiment in the mouse is the first test of the fusion, and a frameshift would lead to a total lack of green signal.\n\n*   **C) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:** The receptor is a transmembrane protein and would be synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and processed through the Golgi apparatus before being transported to the cell membrane. If the Receptor-eGFP fusion protein were misfolded, it might be retained in the ER or Golgi. However, even if stuck in these organelles, the eGFP would still be synthesized, folded correctly, and would fluoresce. A confocal microscope would detect a green signal, but its localization would be intracellular (in a Golgi or ER-like pattern) instead of at the cell membrane. The prompt explicitly states there is *no* green signal, not a mislocalized one.\n\n*   **D) Ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:** A paracrine relationship describes the biological interaction where a secreted ligand from one cell acts on a receptor on a neighboring cell. This describes the *function* of the properly expressed proteins. It has no bearing on whether the Receptor-eGFP fusion protein itself is synthesized and fluorescent. The expression is controlled by the CBA promoter and Cre-mediated recombination, not by the subsequent protein-protein interactions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most likely explanation for a complete absence of the green signal is a technical flaw in the construct's design. An out-of-frame fusion between the receptor and eGFP would prevent the translation of a functional eGFP protein, perfectly explaining the observed result.\n\n<<<B>>>"
