    "Based on the provided spectral data, the most reasonable structure for the unidentified drug is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the data that supports this conclusion.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound. The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158, with an intensity approximately one-third of the molecular ion peak, strongly suggests the presence of a single chlorine atom. 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C7H5ClO2) has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, which is consistent with this data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a distinctive feature of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which in this context, corresponds to the carbonyl group of the carboxylic acid. Both of these features strongly point towards a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm** is a singlet integrating to one proton (1H). This chemical shift is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region, **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)**, indicate a para-substituted (1,4-substituted) benzene ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, resulting in two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The two protons closer to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the other two protons are slightly more shielded (7.72 ppm).\n\nConsidering all pieces of evidence, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the only structure among the choices that perfectly matches all the given spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
