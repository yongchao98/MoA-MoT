    "**A = Benzoquinone, B = Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nHere is the detailed analysis:\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. Keto-enol tautomerism, a common type, involves the migration of a proton (hydrogen atom) from an alpha-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) to the carbonyl oxygen.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** The structure of 1,4-benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms are directly attached to the double-bonded carbons of the ring and are not on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Therefore, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism and does not exhibit this form of isomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has hydrogen atoms on carbons that are alpha to all three carbonyl groups. It can undergo tautomerization to form its enol tautomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic ring, which strongly favors the tautomerization process.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This molecule possesses a chiral center. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    2.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n\n    Because it has a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and thus exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is a symmetrical, trans-alkene. It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups. As a result, the molecule is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism. While it has a cis-isomer (dimethyl maleate), these are geometric isomers, not optical isomers.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining these findings, **A = benzoquinone** and **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
