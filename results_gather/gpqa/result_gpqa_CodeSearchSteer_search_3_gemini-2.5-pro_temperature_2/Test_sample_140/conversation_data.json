    "The reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible products can be determined by considering all potential reaction pathways.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group. There are two such positions in the starting material:\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (Major):** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so the abstraction of the proton from C-6 is faster and the major pathway. This elimination results in a benzyne triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 remains, so this intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n2.  **Pathway B (Minor):** Although slower, it is also possible to abstract the deuteron from C-2. This elimination leads to a benzyne triple bond between C-1 and C-2. This intermediate is **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe nucleophile (NH₂⁻) then attacks one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in the benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is subsequently protonated by the ammonia solvent to give the final aniline product.\n\n#### Products from 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):\nThe benzyne triple bond is between C-1 and C-6, with the deuterium at C-2.\n*   **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂ group attaches to the original C-1. The new C-1 of the product is this carbon. The deuterium atom is at the original C-2 position, which is now C-2 in the aniline product. This yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C-6:** The NH₂ group attaches to the original C-6. This carbon becomes C-1 of the product. The deuterium atom at the original C-2 position is now at C-3 relative to the amino group. This yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nThus, the major pathway produces two distinct products.\n\n#### Products from 2-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway B):\nThe benzyne triple bond is between C-1 and C-2, with deuterium at C-2.\n*   **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-2 (which still has the deuterium atom). Protonation by ammonia places a hydrogen at C-2, forming aniline. The deuterium atom is lost from the ring in a subsequent workup or exchange. This results in regular, non-deuterated **aniline**.\n*   **Attack at C-2:** The NH₂ group attacks the deuterium-bearing C-2. A carbanion forms at C-1. Protonation gives **aniline**, and the deuterium is lost.\n\nWait, the reasoning for Pathway B might be more subtle. A simpler and more accurate analysis is that the initial deprotonation can also occur at the meta position to produce another benzyne, albeit in very minor amounts. Let's reconsider the products from all possible benzyne intermediates arising from m-deuteration. However, based on classic textbook examples, such as the reaction of m-chlorotoluene producing three isomeric toluidines, a similar logic can apply here.\n\nLet's re-examine the full set of possible outcomes considering all ortho-deprotonation routes and subsequent attacks.\nFrom **3-deuterobenzyne**, we get:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline**\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline**\n\nFrom **2-deuterobenzyne**, attack at either C-1 or C-2, followed by protonation of the resulting carbanion leads to:\n3. **Aniline** (non-deuterated): It has been shown that when the deuterium is on one of the benzyne carbons, scrambling and loss of deuterium can occur, leading to the non-isotopically labeled product.\n\nConsidering these three possible distinct organic molecules (aniline, 2-deuterioaniline, and 3-deuterioaniline), there are three possible products. Some interpretations of this classic problem consider four products by including 4-deuterioaniline, which can arise from a less probable 1,3-elimination pathway, though this is not typically covered in introductory mechanisms. Given the standard options, the formation of three products via the two primary benzyne intermediates is the most chemically sound conclusion.\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
