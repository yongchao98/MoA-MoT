    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must follow a step-by-step stoichiometric calculation.\n\nFirst, calculate the initial number of moles for each of the reactants:\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH):** A weak acid.\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 moles\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl):** A strong acid.\n    *   Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2):** A strong base.\n    *   Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 moles. Barium hydroxide is a strong base and dissociates completely to yield two hydroxide ions for each formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 moles = 0.180 moles.\n\nNext, the neutralization reactions occur. The strong base (OH⁻) will first react with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) because this reaction goes to completion.\n*   **Strong Acid-Strong Base Neutralization:**\n    *   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   The H⁺ ions are the limiting reactant. All 0.080 moles of H⁺ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNow, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Strong Base-Weak Acid Neutralization:**\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH available = 0.050 mol\n    *   CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   In this step, the weak acid, CH₃COOH, is the limiting reactant.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ consumed = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻ ions. This excess of a strong base will be the primary determinant of the solution's pH. To find the pH, we first calculate the final concentration of OH⁻.\n\n*   **Total Volume of the Solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTherefore, the pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
