    "An oscillating charge distribution, such as a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis (the z-axis), can be modeled as a simple oscillating electric dipole, especially at distances much larger than the size of the spheroid. The properties of its radiation can be determined from the fundamental principles of electric dipole radiation.\n\n### Angular Distribution of Radiated Power\n\nThe power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ` or `f`) by an oscillating electric dipole is not uniform in all directions. It depends on the angle `θ` between the direction of observation and the axis of oscillation. The relationship is given by:\n\n`f ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\n*   The maximum radiated power, denoted as `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value of 1. This happens at `θ = 90°`, which is the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis.\n*   At an angle of `θ = 30°`, the value of `sin²(30°)` is `(1/2)² = 1/4`.\n*   Therefore, the power radiated at `30°` is `1/4` of the maximum power `A`.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating dipole is also strongly dependent on the frequency (`ω`) or wavelength (`λ`) of the oscillation. The power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (`ω⁴`).\n\nSince angular frequency and wavelength are related by `ω = 2πc/λ` (where `c` is the speed of light), the power dependence on wavelength is:\n\n`f ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis inverse fourth-power relationship is a hallmark of electric dipole radiation and the related phenomenon of Rayleigh scattering.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two findings, the fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at an angle of `30°` is **1/4**, and the functional form of the power's dependence on wavelength is **`λ⁻⁴`**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
