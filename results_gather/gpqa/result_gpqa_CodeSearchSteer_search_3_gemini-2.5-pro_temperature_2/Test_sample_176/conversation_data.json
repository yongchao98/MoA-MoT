    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a perfect black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates luminosity to the star's radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: To find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂), we can divide their respective Stefan-Boltzmann equations:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    By canceling out the constants (4, π, σ), the formula simplifies to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio using Wien's Law and Doppler Effect**:\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law** states that the temperature of a black body is inversely proportional to the wavelength at which it radiates most intensely (its peak wavelength, λ_max). This law refers to the wavelength in the star's own rest frame (λ_rest).\n    *   The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. This refers to the wavelength observed from Earth (λ_obs), which can be affected by the star's motion relative to the observer due to the **Doppler effect**.\n    *   For Star_1 (v₁ = 0 km/s), there is no Doppler shift, so λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1.\n    *   For Star_2 (v₂ = 700 km/s), which is moving away from us, its light is redshifted. The observed wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength, according to the formula: λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v₂/c), where 'c' is the speed of light.\n    *   Since we are given that λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can say: λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   From Wien's Law (T ∝ 1/λ_rest), the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_rest,2 / λ_rest,1.\n    *   Substituting the Doppler relation, we get: T₁/T₂ = λ_rest,2 / (λ_rest,2 * (1 + v₂/c)) = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now, substitute all the known values back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁/L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Using the values:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    *   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00937\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.2289\n\nThis result is closest to option C. The information about the stars' masses is irrelevant to this specific calculation, as the problem is based on the properties of black body radiation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
