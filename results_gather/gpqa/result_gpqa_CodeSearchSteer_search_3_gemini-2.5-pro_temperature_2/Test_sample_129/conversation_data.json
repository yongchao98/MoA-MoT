    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of large neutral hydrogen clouds so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider two key factors: the emitted wavelength of the light being absorbed and the wavelength range that ground-based optical telescopes can observe.\n\n1.  **Emitted Wavelength:** The absorption occurs at the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) wavelength of neutral hydrogen, which is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) or 121.6 nanometers (nm). This is the rest-frame or emitted wavelength (λ_emitted). This radiation is in the ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Observed Wavelength Range:** Optical telescopes on the ground are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most ultraviolet radiation. The atmosphere is largely transparent in what is known as the \"optical window.\" This window allows visible light and some parts of the near-ultraviolet (NUV) and near-infrared to pass through. The lower wavelength cutoff for ground-based observation is primarily due to ozone absorption in the atmosphere. While specialized instruments can push this limit, the practical lower limit for most ground-based optical telescopes is around 3500-4000 Å (350-400 nm). To be detectable, the Lyman-alpha line must be redshifted to at least this wavelength (λ_observed).\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation:** The redshift, denoted by 'z', relates the emitted wavelength and the observed wavelength through the following formula:\n\n    z = (λ_observed - λ_emitted) / λ_emitted\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the observed wavelength: λ_observed = (1 + z) * λ_emitted.\n\nTo find the lower limit on the redshift, we will use the shortest likely observable wavelength, around 3500 Å, as our λ_observed.\n\nUsing the redshift formula:\n\nz = (3500 Å - 1216 Å) / 1216 Å\nz = 2284 Å / 1216 Å\nz ≈ 1.878\n\nThis calculated value of approximately 1.88 is the minimum redshift required to shift the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line into a wavelength range that can penetrate the Earth's atmosphere and be detected by a ground-based optical telescope.\n\nNow, we compare this calculated value with the given options:\nA) 1.9\nB) 3.0\nC) 2.4\nD) 1.2\n\nThe calculated redshift z ≈ 1.88 is closest to 1.9. A redshift of 1.2, for example, would only shift the Lyman-alpha line to 2675 Å, which is deep in the UV and completely blocked by the atmosphere. Redshifts of 2.4 and 3.0 would shift the line to easily observable wavelengths (4134 Å and 4864 Å, respectively), but the question asks for the lower limit. Therefore, 1.9 is the best estimate for the lower limit on the redshift.\n\n<<<A>>>"
