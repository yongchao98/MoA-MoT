    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product E and determine the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A**: This reaction protects the carbonyl group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT). The product, A, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane. The carbon atom from the aldehyde group is now bonded to two sulfur atoms and carries an ethyl group and a hydrogen atom.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi ---> B**: n-Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It removes the most acidic proton from compound A, which is the proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (the C2 position of the dithiane ring). This forms a lithiated carbanion, B, which is a key intermediate in umpolung (polarity inversion) chemistry.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane ---> C**: The nucleophilic carbanion B reacts with bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an SN2 reaction. An ethyl group from bromoethane replaces the lithium atom, resulting in product C, which is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane. At this stage, the carbon at the C2 position is bonded to two ethyl groups.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---> D**: This step is the deprotection of the dithiane group. The two C-S bonds are cleaved, and the carbonyl group is regenerated. The starting material for this step had two ethyl groups attached to the C2 carbon. Therefore, the product D is a ketone with a carbonyl group flanked by two ethyl groups: 3-pentanone (CH₃CH₂COCH₂CH₃).\n\n5.  **D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E**: This is a Wittig reaction.\n    *   First, the Wittig ylide is prepared. Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane. The resulting phosphonium salt is then deprotonated by the strong base BuLi. The proton removed is from the carbon that was bonded to bromine. This forms the phosphorus ylide: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=P(Ph)₃.\n    *   Next, the ylide reacts with the ketone, D (3-pentanone). In the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group and the P(Ph)₃ group of the ylide are eliminated, forming a double bond between the two carbon atoms.\n    *   The reaction is: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=P(Ph)₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + O=P(Ph)₃.\n    *   The final product, E, is **3,4-diethyl-3-hexene**.\n\n**Analysis of the 13C-NMR Spectrum of Product E:**\n\nThe structure of the final product E, 3,4-diethyl-3-hexene, is highly symmetrical:\n```\n      CH₃\n      |\n      CH₂\n      |\nCH₃-CH₂-C = C-CH₂-CH₃\n          |\n          CH₂\n          |\n          CH₃\n```\n\nTo determine the number of 13C-NMR signals, we need to identify the number of unique carbon environments in the molecule. Due to the high symmetry of the molecule (specifically, a C₂ rotation axis perpendicular to the C=C bond and a mirror plane):\n\n1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** The two carbons forming the double bond are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal.\n2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** All four methylene groups are in identical chemical environments. Each is an `sp³` carbon bonded to an `sp²` carbon of the double bond and a methyl group. They will produce a single signal.\n3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** All four terminal methyl groups are also in identical chemical environments. They will produce a single signal.\n\nTherefore, despite having 12 carbon atoms in total, the high degree of symmetry in 3,4-diethyl-3-hexene results in only **3** distinct signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
