    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves a relativistic particle $X^0$ that decays after traveling a certain distance in a bubble chamber. Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe the track left by the particle before it decays for at least 30% of the events.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Values:**\n    *   Proper lifetime of $X^0$: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Total energy of $X^0$: $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest mass of $X^0$: $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/cÂ² (In particle physics, mass is often given in units of energy, so we can write $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the total energy of a particle to its rest mass energy.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    The mean distance a particle travels before decaying in the lab frame is its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$) multiplied by its velocity ($v$). A direct way to calculate this distance ($\\lambda$, the mean decay length) is using the formula:\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0$\n    where $p$ is the particle's momentum. We can find the momentum from the energy-mass relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n    *   First, calculate the momentum ($pc$):\n        $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.784$ GeV\n\n    *   Now, calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$:\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0 = \\frac{26.784 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n        $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (24 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ m})$\n        $\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n5.  **Interpret the Observation Condition:**\n    To \"observe\" a decay, the track length ($L$) must be greater than the detector's spatial resolution ($R$). Particle decay is an exponential process, so the probability that a particle travels a distance greater than $R$ before decaying is given by $P(L > R) = e^{-R/\\lambda}$.\n\n    The problem requires that we observe at least 30% of the decays, which means we need to find the resolution $R$ such that $P(L > R) \\ge 0.30$.\n    $e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n    This inequality sets an upper limit on the acceptable resolution value. A coarser resolution (larger $R$) will fail to observe enough events. The boundary case gives the maximum allowable (i.e., coarsest) resolution:\n    $e^{-R/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    $-R/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    $R = 1.204 \\times \\lambda = 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculation shows that any resolution finer than or equal to $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m will allow observing at least 30% of the decays. We must now look at the given options:\n    A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n    C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n    D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\n    Our calculated characteristic length is on the order of $10^{-6}$ meters (micrometers). Options A, B, and D are of vastly different orders of magnitude. Option C is the only one that is physically plausible.\n\n    The value $R = 2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m satisfies the condition we derived, since $2.08 \\times 10^{-6} < 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$. With a resolution of $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, the fraction of observed decays would be $e^{-(2.08/1.885)} \\approx e^{-1.103} \\approx 0.33$, which is indeed greater than 30%. The minor discrepancy between our calculated limit and the provided option likely stems from a small inaccuracy in the problem's input values. Based on the physics and order of magnitude, C is the only viable choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
