    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first understand the relationship between the energy of light that is absorbed and the energy of light that is emitted.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Color of the Emitted Light\n\nThe textile dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 electron-volts (eV). We can calculate the wavelength of this light to determine its color. The relationship between energy (E) in eV and wavelength (λ) in nanometers (nm) is approximately:\n\nλ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\nFor the emitted light:\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm\n\nA wavelength of 530 nm falls within the **green** portion of the visible light spectrum.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Principle of Fluorescence and Stokes Shift\n\nThe process described, where a substance absorbs light and then emits light at a different color, is called fluorescence. A fundamental principle of fluorescence is the Stokes shift, which states that the emitted light always has a lower energy (and thus a longer wavelength) than the absorbed light. This is because the molecule loses some of the absorbed energy through non-radiative processes, like vibrations, before it emits a photon.\n\nTherefore, the absorbed light must have a higher energy than the emitted green light (2.3393 eV).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Options Based on Energy\n\nLet's examine the energy levels of the colors given in the options, from lowest energy to highest energy: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet.\n\n*   **D) Red:** Has a lower energy (approx. 1.65–2.00 eV) than the emitted green light. Therefore, absorbing red light cannot cause the emission of higher-energy green light.\n*   **B) Yellow:** Has a lower energy (approx. 2.10–2.17 eV) than the emitted green light. This is also not possible.\n*   **A) Violet** and **C) Blue:** Both have higher energies than green light (Blue: approx. 2.50–2.75 eV; Violet: approx. 2.75–3.26 eV).\n\nBoth blue and violet are possible based on the law of energy conservation. However, in fluorescent molecules, the absorption (excitation) and emission peaks are typically located in adjacent color regions. For a dye that emits green light (around 530 nm), the maximum absorption peak is most commonly found in the blue region of the spectrum. This represents a typical Stokes shift. Absorbing violet light to emit green light would represent an unusually large Stokes shift.\n\nTherefore, the most probable color of light absorbed by the compound is blue.\n\n<<<C>>>"
