    "The approximation that nucleons inside a nucleus behave like free nucleons during an interaction is known as the \"impulse approximation.\" This approximation is justified by a set of underlying assumptions about the nature of the interaction and the nuclear environment. Analyzing the given options:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** This is a foundational tenet of the impulse approximation. It assumes that the complex many-body interaction can be simplified to a sum of interactions with each nucleon independently. This is often referred to as the \"one-body current\" assumption, where the probe interacts with only one nucleon at a time. This approach ignores simultaneous interactions with multiple nucleons (many-body currents).\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This assumption implies that neither the incoming probe nor the outgoing struck nucleon interacts with the other nucleons in the nucleus (the \"spectators\"). This is crucial for the struck nucleon to be treated as if it were in a vacuum. The non-interaction of the outgoing nucleon is specifically termed the neglect of \"Final State Interactions\" (FSI).\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic:** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, however, treats the nucleon as the fundamental particle in the interaction. It is a model for the *nuclear many-body problem*, not the internal structure of the nucleon. In fact, many modern calculations are performed within a *relativistic* impulse approximation framework, which better describes the kinematics of the nucleon, but this is distinct from the relativistic motion of the quarks within it. This assumption is not a prerequisite for the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** For a nucleon to behave as if it were free, the effects of the nuclear potential that binds it within the nucleus must be negligible during the very short duration of the high-energy interaction. The high momentum transferred by the probe is assumed to happen over a timescale so short that the binding forces do not have time to act.\n\nBased on this analysis, the impulse approximation is jointly implied by the assumptions that the interaction is with a single nucleon (1), this nucleon does not interact with its surrounding nuclear environment (2), and the binding forces are negligible during the interaction (4). Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe the assumptions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
