    "The performed search confirms the validity of the Boltzmann equation for describing the population of energy levels in stellar atmospheres under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The search results show that for a gas in thermal equilibrium, the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states, `a` and `b`, is given by:\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-(E_b - E_a) / kT)\n\nHere, `N` represents the number of atoms, `g` is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of the energy level, `E` is the energy, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\nTo compare the population of the *same* energy level `i` in two different stars (star 1 and star 2) with temperatures T_1 and T_2, we can write the population of that level relative to the total number of atoms of that element (N_total). This is given by:\n\nN_i / N_total = (g_i / Z(T)) * exp(-E_i / kT)\n\nwhere Z(T) is the partition function.\n\nWe are comparing N_{i,1} in star 1 with N_{i,2} in star 2.\n\nN_{i,1} / N_{i,2} = [ (N_{total,1}/Z(T_1)) * exp(-E_i / kT_1) ] / [ (N_{total,2}/Z(T_2)) * exp(-E_i / kT_2) ]\n\nThe problem is structured as a multiple-choice question, which often implies simplifying assumptions are expected. We assume that the total abundance of iron (N_total) is the same in both stars and that the partition function Z(T) does not change significantly between the two temperatures (i.e., Z(T_1) ≈ Z(T_2)). With these standard simplifications, the equation becomes:\n\nN_{i,1} / N_{i,2} = exp(-E_i / kT_1) / exp(-E_i / kT_2)\nN_{i,1} / N_{i,2} = exp( E_i/k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) )\n\nWe are given that N_{i,1} / N_{i,2} = 2. So:\n\n2 = exp( (E_i / k) * (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) )\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2) = (E_i / k) * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) )\n\nThe problem states that \"the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J\". This refers to E_i (the energy of the excited state relative to the ground state). The value of the Boltzmann constant, `k`, is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n\nTherefore, the ratio `E_i / k` is:\n\nE_i / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our equation, we get:\n\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
