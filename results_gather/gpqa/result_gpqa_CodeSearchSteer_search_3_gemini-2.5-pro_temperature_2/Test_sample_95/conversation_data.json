    "The google search confirms the formulas and constants I used.\n\n*   **Bekenstein-Hawking entropy:** S_BH = k_B * A / (4 * l_p^2), where A is the area of the event horizon, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and l_p is the Planck length. The area of the event horizon A is 4πR_s², where R_s is the Schwarzschild radius.\n*   **Schwarzschild radius:** R_s = 2GM / c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light.\n*   **Physical Constants:**\n    *   Gravitational constant G ≈ 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ N⋅m²/kg².\n    *   Speed of light c ≈ 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s.\n    *   Boltzmann constant k_B ≈ 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K.\n    *   Planck length l_p ≈ 1.616 × 10⁻³⁵ m.\n*   **Unit Conversions:**\n    *   1 parsec ≈ 3.086 × 10¹⁶ meters.\n    *   1 degree = π/180 radians.\n\nMy calculation steps were:\n1.  **Convert units:**\n    *   d = 10¹⁰ pc * (3.086 × 10¹⁶ m/pc) = 3.086 × 10²⁶ m\n    *   θ = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees * (π/180 rad/degree) ≈ 1.745 × 10⁻¹⁹ rad\n2.  **Calculate the diameter of the event horizon (D):**\n    *   Using the small-angle approximation (D = d * θ)\n    *   D = (3.086 × 10²⁶ m) * (1.745 × 10⁻¹⁹ rad) ≈ 5.385 × 10⁷ m\n3.  **Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (R_s):**\n    *   R_s = D / 2 ≈ 2.693 × 10⁷ m\n4.  **Calculate the area of the event horizon (A):**\n    *   A = 4πR_s² = 4 * π * (2.693 × 10⁷ m)² ≈ 9.11 × 10¹⁵ m²\n5.  **Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (S_BH):**\n    *   l_p² ≈ (1.616 × 10⁻³⁵ m)² ≈ 2.611 × 10⁻⁷⁰ m²\n    *   S_BH = (k_B * A) / (4 * l_p²) = (1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K * 9.11 × 10¹⁵ m²) / (4 * 2.611 × 10⁻⁷⁰ m²)\n    *   S_BH ≈ (1.257 × 10⁻⁷ J/K m²) / (1.044 × 10⁻⁶⁹ m²) ≈ 1.204 × 10⁶² J/K\n\nThe result is approximately 1.2 x 10⁶² J/K.\nThe order of magnitude is 10⁶².\nThis corresponds to option D.\nThe steps and conclusion are sound. I am ready to give the final answer.\nTo find the entropy of the black hole, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Convert Units:** First, we convert the given distance and angular size into SI units.\n    *   The distance to the galaxy is d = 10¹⁰ parsecs. Since 1 parsec is approximately 3.086 × 10¹⁶ meters, the distance in meters is:\n        d = 10¹⁰ pc * (3.086 × 10¹⁶ m/pc) = 3.086 × 10²⁶ m.\n    *   The angular size is θ = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees. To use this in trigonometric calculations, we convert it to radians. Knowing that 180° = π radians, we have:\n        θ = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees * (π / 180) radians ≈ 1.745 × 10⁻¹⁹ radians.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Diameter of the Event Horizon:** For a very small angle, the diameter (D) of the event horizon can be found using the formula D ≈ d * θ.\n    *   D ≈ (3.086 × 10²⁶ m) * (1.745 × 10⁻¹⁹ rad) ≈ 5.385 × 10⁷ m.\n\n3.  **Determine the Schwarzschild Radius (Rs):** The diameter of the event horizon is twice the Schwarzschild radius (D = 2Rs).\n    *   Rs = D / 2 ≈ 2.693 × 10⁷ m.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Area of the Event Horizon (A):** The area of a sphere is given by A = 4πRs².\n    *   A = 4 * π * (2.693 × 10⁷ m)² ≈ 9.11 × 10¹⁵ m².\n\n5.  **Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy (S):** The entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.\n    *   S = (k_B * A) / (4 * l_p²)\n    *   Where:\n        *   k_B is the Boltzmann constant (≈ 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K)\n        *   l_p is the Planck length (≈ 1.616 × 10⁻³⁵ m)\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        S ≈ (1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K * 9.11 × 10¹⁵ m²) / (4 * (1.616 × 10⁻³⁵ m)²)\n        S ≈ (1.257 × 10⁻⁷ J/K·m²) / (4 * 2.611 × 10⁻⁷⁰ m²)\n        S ≈ (1.257 × 10⁻⁷ J/K·m²) / (1.0444 × 10⁻⁶⁹ m²)\n        S ≈ 1.204 × 10⁶² J/K\n\nThe calculated entropy is approximately 1.204 × 10⁶² J/K. The order of magnitude is therefore 10⁶².\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 10⁵⁹ J/K\nB) 10⁶⁵ J/K\nC) 10⁶⁶ J/K\nD) 10⁶² J/K\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
