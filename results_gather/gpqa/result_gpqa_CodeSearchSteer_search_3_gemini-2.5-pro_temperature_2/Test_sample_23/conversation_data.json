    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. Let its formula be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as:\n    Mass Fraction (H) = (y * Atomic Mass of H) / (x * Atomic Mass of C + y * Atomic Mass of H)\n    0.1428 ≈ (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)\n*   Solving for the ratio y/x:\n    y ≈ 0.1428 * (12x + y)\n    y ≈ 1.7136x + 0.1428y\n    0.8572y ≈ 1.7136x\n    y/x ≈ 1.999 ≈ 2\n*   This means the empirical formula for Z is CH₂. The general molecular formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Z is described as being formed after hydrogenation under severe conditions and does not react further with hydrogen, which indicates it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also a widely used solvent and a constituent of mixture Y. Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Its formula fits the CₙH₂ₙ (for n=6) structure. We can thus confidently identify **Z as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This implies the components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from the disproportionation of mixture X when heated with platinum.\n*   The hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   One component of Y is Z itself (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂). The other component must also be a C₆ hydrocarbon that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   The disproportionation of six-membered ring unsaturated hydrocarbons like cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene over a platinum catalyst typically yields cyclohexane and benzene.\n*   Benzene (C₆H₆) does not readily react with bromine water. When hydrogenated under severe conditions, it converts to cyclohexane.\n*   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Identification of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Both components must have a six-carbon atom skeleton, as they form C₆ compounds upon reaction and hydrogenation.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   X undergoes disproportionation to form an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   Let the two components of X be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ. The disproportionation reaction is essentially a transfer of hydrogen atoms. The average number of hydrogen atoms per molecule in the product mixture Y is (12 + 6) / 2 = 9. In an equimolar mixture, this average must be conserved from the reactants.\n    (a + b) / 2 = 9\n    a + b = 18\n*   We need to find two unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆ hydrocarbons whose hydrogen counts sum to 18.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** fits the description: it's a C₆ liquid, unsaturated, and its single double bond is not a conjugated system.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** also fits: it's a C₆ liquid, unsaturated, and its two double bonds are separated by CH₂ groups, so they are not conjugated. (Note: 1,3-Cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds and is therefore excluded).\n*   Let's check if the hydrogen count for these two molecules matches our requirement:\n    10 (from cyclohexene) + 8 (from 1,4-cyclohexadiene) = 18.\n*   This perfectly matches the hydrogen balance. Thus, **mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
