    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, `<S_y>`, for an electron in the spin state (3i, 4), we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Spin State**: The given unnormalized spin state can be represented by the ket vector:\n    |ψ⟩ =  (<sup>3i</sup><sub>4</sub>)\n\n2.  **Normalize the Spin State**: A quantum state vector must be normalized, meaning the inner product of the state with itself is equal to 1. First, we find the squared norm of the state:\n    ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-3i 4] (<sup>3i</sup><sub>4</sub>) = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25\n    The normalization constant is the reciprocal of the square root of this value, which is 1/√25 = 1/5.\n    The normalized state vector is:\n    |ψ<sub>norm</sub>⟩ = (1/5) (<sup>3i</sup><sub>4</sub>)\n\n3.  **Define the Spin Operator in the y-direction (S_y)**: The spin operator `S_y` is related to the Pauli spin matrix `σ_y` by the formula `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`. Given the matrix for `σ_y`, the operator `S_y` is:\n    S<sub>y</sub> = (ħ/2) (<sup>0 &nbsp; -i</sup><sub>i &nbsp; &nbsp;0</sub>)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value**: The expectation value `⟨S_y⟩` is calculated using the formula `⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_norm|S_y|ψ_norm⟩`.\n\n    First, apply the `S_y` operator to the normalized state vector:\n    S<sub>y</sub>|ψ<sub>norm</sub>⟩ = (ħ/2) (<sup>0 &nbsp; -i</sup><sub>i &nbsp; &nbsp;0</sub>) * (1/5) (<sup>3i</sup><sub>4</sub>) = (ħ/10) (<sup>-4i</sup><sub>-3</sub>)\n\n    Next, take the inner product of the resulting vector with the normalized bra vector `⟨ψ_norm|` = (1/5)[-3i 4]:\n    ⟨S<sub>y</sub>⟩ = (1/5)[-3i 4] * (ħ/10) (<sup>-4i</sup><sub>-3</sub>)\n    ⟨S<sub>y</sub>⟩ = (ħ/50) [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n    ⟨S<sub>y</sub>⟩ = (ħ/50) [12i<sup>2</sup> - 12]\n    Since i<sup>2</sup> = -1:\n    ⟨S<sub>y</sub>⟩ = (ħ/50) [-12 - 12] = -24ħ/50\n\n    Simplifying the fraction gives:\n    ⟨S<sub>y</sub>⟩ = -12ħ/25\n\nThis result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
