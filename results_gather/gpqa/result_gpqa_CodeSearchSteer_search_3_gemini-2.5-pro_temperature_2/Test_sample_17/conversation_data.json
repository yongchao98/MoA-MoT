    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Abundance Notation\n\nThe notation `[A/B]` represents the logarithmic ratio of the number of atoms of element A to element B in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun. The formula is:\n\n`[A/B] = log10( (n_A / n_B)_star ) - log10( (n_A / n_B)_sun )`\n\nThis can be rearranged to:\n\n`(n_A / n_B)_star = 10^[A/B] * (n_A / n_B)_sun`\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2. In astrophysical contexts, this refers to the ratio of their abundances, which is typically the number of atoms of an element relative to hydrogen `(n_Si / n_H)`. Our goal is to calculate `(n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2`.\n\n### 2. A Key Identity\n\nA useful identity derived from the definition is: `[A/H] = [A/B] + [B/H]`. This allows us to calculate the abundance of an element relative to hydrogen from other known ratios.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Silicon Abundance for Star 1\n\nFor Star 1, we are given:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`\n\nUsing the identity `[Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H]`:\n\n`[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\nThis means that for Star 1:\n\n`(n_Si / n_H)_1 = 10^[Si/H]_1 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun = 10^0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Silicon Abundance for Star 2\n\nFor Star 2, we are given:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`\n\nWe want to find `[Si/H]_2`. We can rearrange the identity: `[Mg/H] = [Mg/Si] + [Si/H]`.\n\n`[Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3`\n\nThis means that for Star 2:\n\n`(n_Si / n_H)_2 = 10^[Si/H]_2 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun = 10^-0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun`\n\n### 5. Calculating the Final Ratio\n\nNow we can compute the ratio of the silicon abundances of Star 1 to Star 2:\n\n`Ratio = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`\n\n`Ratio = ( 10^0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) / ( 10^-0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n\nThe solar silicon abundance `(n_Si / n_H)_sun` cancels out:\n\n`Ratio = 10^0.3 / 10^-0.3 = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) = 10^0.6`\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n\n`10^0.6 â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\nThe information about the stellar masses, the specific values of solar abundances for Fe and Mg, and the observational methods (LTE, EW) are not needed for this calculation, as the problem relies on relative abundance ratios.\n\n<<<C>>>"
