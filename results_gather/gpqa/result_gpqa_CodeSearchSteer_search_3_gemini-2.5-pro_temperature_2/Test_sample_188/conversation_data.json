    "A phonon is the Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. A magnon is the Nambu-Goldstone boson that arises from the spontaneous breaking of spin-rotational symmetry in a magnet. A pion is the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics.\n\nIn contrast, a skyrmion is a topologically non-trivial, particle-like soliton. While the context in which skyrmions arise, such as in chiral magnets or certain liquid crystal phases, involves spontaneous symmetry breaking, the skyrmion itself is a stable, localized topological defect rather than the massless Goldstone mode that results from the symmetry breaking. The Goldstone bosons in a magnetic system that hosts skyrmions would be the magnons (spin waves).\n\nTherefore, the phonon, magnon, and pion are all directly identified as (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone bosons, which are the excitations associated with spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. The skyrmion is a distinct topological object.\n\n<<<B>>>"
