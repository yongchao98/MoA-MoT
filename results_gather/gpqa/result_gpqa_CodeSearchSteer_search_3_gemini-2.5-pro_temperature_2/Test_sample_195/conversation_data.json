    "My initial derivation based on the conservation of energy is correct. Let me re-verify the reasoning.\n\n1.  **System and Energy:** The system consists of the mass `m` and the spring. The total energy of this isolated system must be conserved.\n\n2.  **Energy Components:** The total energy `E_total` is the sum of the potential energy `U(x)` stored in the spring and the total energy of the particle, which includes its rest energy `mc^2` and its relativistic kinetic energy `K_rel`.\n    However, a simpler and more direct approach is to consider the conservation of the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy. The relativistic kinetic energy is `K_rel = (γ - 1)mc^2`. The potential energy is `U(x) = (1/2)kx^2`.\n    Therefore, the total conserved energy `E_total` of the system is:\n    `E_total = K_rel + U(x) = (γ - 1)mc^2 + (1/2)kx^2`.\n\n3.  **State 1: Maximum Amplitude (x = A):**\n    *   The mass is momentarily at rest, so `v = 0`.\n    *   This means the Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0^2/c^2) = 1`.\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy is `K_rel = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0`.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: `U(A) = (1/2)kA^2`.\n    *   The total energy of the system is `E_total = 0 + (1/2)kA^2 = (1/2)kA^2`.\n\n4.  **State 2: Equilibrium Position (x = 0):**\n    *   The mass has its maximum speed, `v = v_max`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is `γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max^2/c^2)`.\n    *   The kinetic energy is at its maximum: `K_rel_max = (γ_max - 1)mc^2`.\n    *   The potential energy is zero: `U(0) = 0`.\n    *   The total energy of the system is `E_total = (γ_max - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (γ_max - 1)mc^2`.\n\n5.  **Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n    Equate the total energy from State 1 and State 2:\n    `(1/2)kA^2 = (γ_max - 1)mc^2`\n\n6.  **Solve for v_max:**\n    *   First, rearrange the equation to solve for `γ_max`:\n        `γ_max - 1 = kA^2 / (2mc^2)`\n        `γ_max = 1 + kA^2 / (2mc^2)`\n    *   Now, substitute the definition of `γ_max`:\n        `1 / √(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + kA^2 / (2mc^2)`\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        `√(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 / (1 + kA^2 / (2mc^2))`\n    *   Square both sides:\n        `1 - v_max^2/c^2 = 1 / (1 + kA^2 / (2mc^2))^2`\n    *   Isolate the `v_max` term:\n        `v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1 / (1 + kA^2 / (2mc^2))^2`\n    *   Solve for `v_max`:\n        `v_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + kA^2 / (2mc^2))^2]`\n\nThis confirms the derivation and matches option A exactly. One search result also provides an energy conservation equation for the relativistic harmonic oscillator that supports this reasoning. It states that the total energy `E` can be integrated to yield `E = mc^2 + (1/2)ka^2` at the maximum excursion. This represents the total energy of the particle (`γmc^2` at `v_max`) being equal to its rest energy plus the maximum potential energy, which is the same starting point I used in my initial, slightly different (but equivalent) reasoning (`γ_max * mc^2 = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2`).\n\n<<<A>>>"
