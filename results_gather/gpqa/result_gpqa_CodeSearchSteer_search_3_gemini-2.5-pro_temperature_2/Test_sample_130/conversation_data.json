    "Anhydride: The starting material is a cis-alkene dicarboxylic acid which, upon dehydration, forms an anhydride. The 1H NMR spectrum of this anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its 13C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This spectroscopic data corresponds to maleic anhydride. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, giving rise to a single 1H signal. Similarly, there are two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, resulting in two 13C signals.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a five-membered ring with methyl groups on each of the four carbons involved in the two double bonds (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a methylene group at C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a Diels-Alder reaction. This [4+2] cycloaddition reaction forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\nThe Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclic diene and a dienophile yields two possible stereoisomeric products: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct.\n\n*   According to the Alder rule, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product and is typically the major product, especially under mild conditions.\n*   The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically more stable product and is typically the minor product.\n\nThe question states that a major and a minor product are formed. We can assume the major product is the *endo* adduct and the minor product is the *exo* adduct. The molecular formula of both products is C13H16O3, which is consistent with the addition of C9H14 (diene) and C4H2O3 (dienophile).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structure for NOESY Correlations**\nA NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Ã…). We need to find a proton-proton interaction that exists in the major (*endo*) product but is absent or weak in the minor (*exo*) product.\n\nLet's analyze the structures of the *endo* and *exo* adducts:\n*   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n*   The C7 carbon is the methylene (CH2) bridge from the original diene.\n*   The protons from the maleic anhydride are now methine protons on the bicyclic framework, adjacent to the anhydride carbonyls. Let's call them Ha.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the product, there are several sets of equivalent protons which will appear as singlets in the 1H NMR spectrum:\n    *   **Ha:** The two methine protons from the anhydride, appearing as a 2H singlet. Based on similar structures, their chemical shift is downfield, around 3-4 ppm. The question provides a value of ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These will be a 6H singlet, likely upfield around ~1 ppm.\n    *   **Vinyl Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the double bond (C5 and C6). These will be a 6H singlet, around ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   **Bridge Protons:** The two protons of the C7-CH2 bridge are not equivalent. One is *syn* (on the same face) to the C5=C6 double bond and the other is *anti*. They would split each other, appearing as two doublets. A chemical shift of ~1.5 ppm is reasonable for one of these protons.\n\nNow, let's compare the spatial proximities in the two isomers:\n*   ***Endo* (Major) Product:** The anhydride part is tucked *under* the newly formed six-membered ring. This places the methine protons (Ha, ~3.5 ppm) on the same side as the C7-CH2 bridge. Therefore, a strong NOE interaction is expected between the anhydride methine protons (Ha) and the C7 bridge protons.\n*   ***Exo* (Minor) Product:** The anhydride part is oriented away from the six-membered ring. This places the methine protons (Ha, ~3.5 ppm) far away from the C7-CH2 bridge. The NOE interaction between Ha and the bridge protons would be absent or very weak. Conversely, in the exo-product, the Ha protons are close to the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm).\n\nThe question describes a cross-peak that is PRESENT in the major product and ABSENT in the minor product. The interaction between the anhydride methine protons (Ha, ~3.5 ppm) and a C7 bridge proton (~1.5 ppm) fits this description perfectly.\n\nLet's check the options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: Interaction between the two different types of methyl groups. This is not the most distinct differentiating feature between the isomers.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: Interaction between vinyl methyls and anhydride protons. This is characteristic of the *minor* (exo) product, not the major one.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: Interaction between a bridgehead methyl and a bridge proton. This interaction is likely present to some extent in both isomers.\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: Interaction between a C7 bridge proton and the anhydride methine protons. As analyzed, this interaction is strong in the major (*endo*) isomer and weak or absent in the minor (*exo*) isomer.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the resonance for the C7 bridge proton and the resonance for the anhydride methine protons.\n\n<<<D>>>"
