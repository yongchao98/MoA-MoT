    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the velocity of particle A.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe process begins with a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The term \"slowly moving\" implies we can neglect the kinetic energy of the antiproton. Assuming the proton is also at rest (as in a fixed target experiment), the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton.\n\nThe rest energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV. Since a proton and an antiproton have the same mass, their rest energies are identical.\n\n*   Initial Energy ($E_i$) = Rest Energy of Proton + Rest Energy of Antiproton\n*   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n*   $E_i = 2 \\times 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\nThe annihilation results in four particles of type A ($2A^+$, $2A^-$), each with a rest mass corresponding to an energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$. The total final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of these four particles. The relativistic energy of each particle A is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and is dependent on the particle's velocity.\n\n*   Final Energy ($E_f$) = $4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$\n*   $E_f = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the initial energy must equal the final energy:\n$E_i = E_f$\n$1876 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the proton and antiproton are assumed to be at rest, the total initial momentum of the system is zero. Due to the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum of the four A particles must also be zero. This means the particles must fly off in directions such that their vector momenta cancel out.\n\n**3. Calculating the Velocity**\n\nFrom the energy conservation equation, we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\nThe Lorentz factor is related to velocity ($v$) by the formula:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nWe can now rearrange this formula to solve for the velocity, $v$:\n$\\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} = 1 - (v/c)^2$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.409}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
