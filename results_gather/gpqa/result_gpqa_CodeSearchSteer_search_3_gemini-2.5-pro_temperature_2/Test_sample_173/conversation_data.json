    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the solution:\n\n**1. Determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.**\n\n*   Let M be the mass of the initial nucleus, and m1 and m2 be the rest-masses of the two fragments.\n*   The initial rest-mass energy is given as M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   The more massive fragment (m1) is twice as massive as the other (m2):\n    m1 = 2 * m2\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass:\n    m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n*   Substitute m1 = 2*m2 into the second equation:\n    (2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M  =>  3 * m2 = 0.99 * M  =>  m2 = 0.33 * M\n*   Now find m1:\n    m1 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n*   We can now calculate their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n    *   Energy of the more massive fragment (m1): m1*c² = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n    *   Energy of the less massive fragment (m2): m2*c² = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**2. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n\n*   The Q-value is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This difference is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   Q = (M*c²) - (m1*c² + m2*c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\n    T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy T1.**\n\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is conserved and must be zero. The fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum (p1 = p2).\n*   The relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)².\n*   This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (T = E - m*c²):\n    (p*c)² = E² - (m*c²)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²)\n*   Since p1 = p2, we have (p1*c)² = (p2*c)², so:\n    T1² + 2*T1*(m1*c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2*c²)\n*   Substitute T2 = 3 - T1, m1*c² = 198 GeV, and m2*c² = 99 GeV:\n    T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)\n    T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)\n*   Simplifying the equation:\n    396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1\n    600*T1 = 603\n    T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate the non-relativistic (classical) kinetic energy T1.**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\n*   From the conservation of momentum (p1 = p2), we can write the ratio of the classical kinetic energies:\n    T1_classical / T2_classical = (p² / (2*m1)) / (p² / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1\n*   Since m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is:\n    T1_classical / T2_classical = 1 / 2  =>  T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical\n*   Using the total kinetic energy, T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV:\n    T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV\n    3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n    T1_classical = 1 GeV.\n\n**5. Find the difference.**\n\n*   The difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classically calculated T1 is:\n    ΔT1 = T1 - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n*   Finally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    ΔT1 = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
