    "This problem involves calculating the probability of a sequence of outcomes in quantum measurements. Here is a step-by-step solution:\n\n### 1. Initial State and Operators\n\nThe initial state of the system, which we'll call `|ψ⟩`, is given by the column matrix:\n`|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`ᵀ\n\nThe operators for the observables P and Q are represented by the matrices:\n`P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n`Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n### 2. Normalize the Initial State\n\nFirst, the given state vector `|ψ⟩` must be normalized. The squared norm of the state is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalization constant is `1/√6`. The normalized state, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`ᵀ\n\n### 3. Measurement of P\n\nThe first measurement is of the observable P, and we are interested in the outcome where the result is 0. This means we need to find the eigenvector of P that corresponds to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.\n\n*   **Eigenvalues and Eigenvector of P:**\n    The eigenvalues `λ` of P are found by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, which yields eigenvalues `λ = 0, 1, -1`. We are interested in `λ = 0`.\n    To find the eigenvector `|p₀⟩` for `λ = 0`, we solve `P|p₀⟩ = 0 * |p₀⟩`:\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] [x, y, z]`ᵀ `= [0, 0, 0]`ᵀ\n    This gives the equations:\n    *   `(1/√2)y = 0` → `y = 0`\n    *   `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` → `x + z = 0` → `x = -z`\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 0, -1]`ᵀ.\n    Normalizing this eigenvector gives `|p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`ᵀ.\n\n*   **Probability of Measuring P=0:**\n    The probability of measuring P and obtaining the value 0 is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the normalized initial state onto the eigenvector `|p₀⟩`.\n    `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n    The inner product `⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n    `⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]] ⋅ [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]]`\n    `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = -2/√12 = -1/√3`\n    The probability is the squared magnitude of this value:\n    `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n### 4. State Collapse and Measurement of Q\n\nAfter measuring P and getting 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|p₀⟩`. The new state of the system is `|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`ᵀ.\n\nNext, the observable Q is measured on this new state `|ψ'⟩`. We want to find the probability of obtaining the value -1.\n\n*   **Eigenvector of Q for λ=-1:**\n    The operator Q is a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: `1, 0, -1`. The eigenvector `|q₋₁⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `-1` is `[0, 0, 1]`ᵀ. This is already normalized.\n\n*   **Probability of Measuring Q=-1:**\n    The probability of measuring Q and getting -1, given the system is in the state `|ψ'⟩`, is calculated as:\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²`\n    The inner product `⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩` is:\n    `⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] ⋅ [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]]`\n    `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`\n    The probability is:\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n### 5. Total Probability\n\nThe total probability of measuring P=0 and then immediately measuring Q=-1 is the product of the probabilities of each step in the sequence.\n\n`Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`\n`Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
