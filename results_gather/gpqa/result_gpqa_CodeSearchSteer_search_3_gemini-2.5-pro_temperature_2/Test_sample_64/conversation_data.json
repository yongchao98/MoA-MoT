    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H⁺) → A\n\n**Mechanism:** This reaction proceeds via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. The reagents and reaction type point to the following sequence:\n\n1.  **Deprotonation:** Potassium hydride (KH) is a strong base that deprotonates the alcohol (-OH) group to form a potassium alkoxide (O⁻K⁺). The formation of the alkoxide is crucial as it greatly accelerates the subsequent rearrangement (by a factor of 10¹⁰ to 10¹⁷).\n2.  **Rearrangement:** The starting material, 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol, possesses a strained vinylcyclobutane system. The presence of the alkoxide initiates a cascade of rearrangements. This complex transformation involves the ring-opening of the strained four-membered ring, followed by a-sigmatropic rearrangement (Cope rearrangement). Such tandem sequences are known to form bridged bicyclic systems. While the exact mechanism is intricate, this sequence transforms the initial spiro[3.5] framework into a bicyclo[5.3.1] skeleton.\n3.  **Tautomerization:** The oxy-Cope rearrangement initially produces an enolate ion. The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates this enolate to form an enol, which then rapidly tautomerizes to the more stable ketone.\n\n**Product A:** Based on the skeletal rearrangement, the 11-carbon starting material (C₁₁H₁₆O) is converted into an 11-carbon bicyclic ketone. The structure formed is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) → B\n\n**Mechanism:** This reaction is a classic example of the Ireland-Claisen rearrangement.\n\n1.  **Esterification:** The allylic alcohol, (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol, reacts with acetyl bromide to form an allyl acetate ester, (E)-pent-2-en-1-yl acetate.\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is a strong, sterically hindered base. It selectively deprotonates the α-carbon of the acetyl group of the ester, creating a lithium ester enolate. The reaction is typically conducted at low temperatures (e.g., -78 °C).\n3.  **-Sigmatropic Rearrangement:** The resulting allyl ester enolate is perfectly set up for a-sigmatropic rearrangement. This concerted, pericyclic reaction proceeds through a chair-like transition state, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n4.  **Product B:** The rearrangement breaks the allylic carbon-oxygen bond and forms a new carbon-carbon bond, resulting in the formation of a lithium salt of a γ,δ-unsaturated carboxylic acid. The product immediately after the rearrangement and before any aqueous workup is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**. Since the reaction conditions do not specify an acidic workup, the product is the lithium salt.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product A is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.\n*   Product B is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.\n\nThis combination matches the description in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
