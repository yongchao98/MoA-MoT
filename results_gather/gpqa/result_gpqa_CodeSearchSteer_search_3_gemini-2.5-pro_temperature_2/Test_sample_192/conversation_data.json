    "To determine how the number of stars per unit distance changes, we first need to establish the relationship between distance and parallax.\n\nThe parallax of a star (`plx`) is inversely proportional to its distance (`r`). This can be expressed as:\n\n`plx ∝ 1/r`\n\nTherefore, `r ∝ 1/plx`.\n\nThe problem states that the number of stars (`N`) observed in this region varies with parallax as:\n\n`N ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n\nWe can substitute the relationship between parallax and distance into this equation to find how the total number of stars out to a certain distance `r` depends on that distance.\n\nSince `plx ∝ 1/r`, it follows that `1/plx ∝ r`. Substituting this into the equation for `N`:\n\n`N ∝ (1/plx)⁵ ∝ r⁵`\n\nThis means the total number of stars up to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n\nThe question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of distance*, which is the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance (`dN/dr`). To find this, we differentiate the expression for `N` with respect to `r`.\n\nIf we let `N = k * r⁵` (where `k` is a constant of proportionality), the derivative is:\n\n`dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵) = 5 * k * r⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`:\n\n`dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n<<<B>>>"
