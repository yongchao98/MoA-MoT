    "To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, one must analyze the structure of the mathematical expression provided. In quantum field theory, specific factors in the amplitude calculation are directly related to the number of loops in a diagram.\n\nThe key to solving this puzzle lies in the `1/(4π)^6` term. In calculations involving loop diagrams, particularly when using dimensional regularization in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop integral over an undetermined momentum introduces a characteristic factor. After performing the integration over the angular components of the loop momentum, each loop contributes a factor of `1/(4π)^2`.\n\nLet `L` be the number of loops in the diagram. The total contribution from all the loop integrals will be `(1/(4π)^2)^L`, which simplifies to `1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nBy comparing this general form to the term found in the note, `1/(4π)^6`, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving this simple equation for `L` gives:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other parts of the expression relate to different aspects of the diagram:\n*   `alpha^3` and `g^2` are coupling constants, indicating the number and types of vertices in the diagram.\n*   `sqrt(2)` and `8` are numerical factors that can arise from symmetry considerations or traces over internal degrees of freedom.\n*   `(Q/M)^2` is a kinematic factor, representing the ratio of an external momentum scale `Q` to an internal mass scale `M`.\n\nWhile these factors provide additional information about the specific theory and process, the power of `4π` is the most direct indicator of the loop number. Therefore, the unreadable Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<C>>>"
