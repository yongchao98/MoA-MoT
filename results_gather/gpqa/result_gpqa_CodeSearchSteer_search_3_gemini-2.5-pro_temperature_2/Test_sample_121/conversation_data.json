    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Reaction Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   This is an alpha-bromination of acetic acid (CH₃COOH). While not a standard Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, the combination of reagents achieves the same outcome. Pyridine acts as a base, and acetic anhydride may facilitate enolate formation.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄).\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   Ethyl cyanoacetate has acidic α-hydrogens on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) groups.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates this carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br) in an alkylation reaction. First, one bromine is displaced to form an intermediate: `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br`.\n    *   Since there is excess NaH, the remaining acidic α-hydrogen is also removed, forming a new carbanion: `NC-C⁻(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br`.\n    *   This intermediate undergoes a rapid intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the second bromine at the other end of the pentyl chain. This is a highly favorable process that forms a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane (also known as ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate).\n\n### **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane**. To find the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclohexane ring substituted at one carbon (C1) with both a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n1.  **Symmetry:**\n    *   The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) are different.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule.\n    *   This lack of symmetry means that corresponding protons on opposite sides of the ring (e.g., at C2 and C6, or C3 and C5) are not chemically equivalent.\n\n2.  **Counting the Distinct Hydrogens:**\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   Since the molecule is asymmetric, the five carbons of the ring bearing hydrogens (C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are all in chemically distinct environments.\n        *   Furthermore, on each of these carbons, the two geminal hydrogens (one typically axial, one equatorial in a chair conformation) are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. They have different spatial relationships with the substituents on C1.\n        *   Therefore, each of the five CH₂ groups on the ring gives rise to two distinct signals.\n        *   Number of signals from the ring = 5 CH₂ groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n    *   **Ethoxycarbonyl Group Protons (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The three hydrogens of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **Methylene Protons (-OCH₂-):** The two hydrogens of the methylene group are, strictly speaking, diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. In theory, this would produce two distinct signals. However, they are distant from the chiral part of the molecule, and the difference in their chemical shifts is often negligible, causing them to appear as a single, combined signal in a standard spectrum. Given the provided options, it is common in such problems to count these as practically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n    *   **Total Number of Signals:**\n        *   Adding the signals from the ring and the ethyl group:\n        *   Total signals = 10 (from ring) + 1 (from -OCH₂-) + 1 (from -CH₃) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis number corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
