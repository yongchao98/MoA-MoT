    "The user is asking about a fundamental concept in the addition of angular momentum in quantum mechanics.\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:** The system is in the coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>$. This means the total angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$ and the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum is $m=-1$. The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the measurement:** A joint measurement of the z-components of the individual angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n\n3.  **Identify the desired outcome:** The desired outcome is that the measurement of $L_{1z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ and the measurement of $L_{2z}$ also yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$.\n\n4.  **Relate eigenvalues to quantum numbers:** The eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is $m_l \\hbar$. Therefore, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to a magnetic quantum number $m_l = -1$. The desired outcome is to find the system in a state where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n5.  **Apply the rules of angular momentum addition:** In quantum mechanics, the operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-component operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This implies that the corresponding quantum numbers must also add up. An eigenstate of total angular momentum $|l, m>$ is a superposition of the uncoupled states $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$, but only those for which the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied. Any uncoupled state for which $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$ will have a zero probability of being observed.\n\n6.  **Check the condition:**\n    *   The system is in a state with total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome corresponds to individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the sum: $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Since the sum of the desired individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$) is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the system ($m=-1$), this outcome is impossible. The probability of measuring this outcome is exactly zero. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which gives the amplitude for this specific state transition, is zero by this selection rule.\n\n<<<B>>>"
