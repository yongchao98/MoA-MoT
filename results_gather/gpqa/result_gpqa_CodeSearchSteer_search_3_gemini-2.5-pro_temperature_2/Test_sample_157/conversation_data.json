    "A dominant-negative mutation produces a mutant protein that interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced from the other allele in a heterozygote. In this case, the transcription factor must form a dimer to be active. A heterozygous individual with mutation Y produces both wild-type (WT) and mutant (Y) protein subunits.\n\nThree types of dimers can form:\n1.  **WT-WT:** Functional\n2.  **Y-Y:** Non-functional\n3.  **WT-Y:** Non-functional (heterodimer)\n\nThe key to the dominant-negative effect is the formation of the non-functional WT-Y heterodimer. The mutant Y protein \"poisons\" the complex, preventing the WT protein it partners with from functioning correctly. This leads to an overall loss-of-function phenotype because the concentration of functional WT-WT dimers is significantly reduced.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options based on this mechanism:\n\n*   **A) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect because a dominant-negative mutation results in a mutant phenotype, not a wild-type one.\n*   **B) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While protein aggregation can cause a loss-of-function, the specific mechanism of a dominant-negative mutation in a dimeric protein is interference, not necessarily aggregation. Aggregation is a possible but less precise description of the core event.\n*   **C) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation causes a *loss* of function, not a gain of function.\n*   **D) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most likely molecular phenotype. The phrase \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\" perfectly describes the outcome of a dominant-negative mutationâ€”the mutant protein prevents the wild-type protein from doing its job. Furthermore, a common cellular response to improperly formed protein complexes, such as a non-functional WT-Y heterodimer, is to target them for degradation by the cell's quality control machinery (e.g., the proteasome). This degradation effectively removes the wild-type protein from the cell, cementing the loss-of-function phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the mutant Y protein causes both the degradation of the protein complexes and the functional loss of the wild-type protein it binds to.\n\n<<<D>>>"
