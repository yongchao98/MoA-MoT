    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base used to form an enolate from the ketone. The enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 carbon is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons to be removed.\n    *   The C6 carbon is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the t-BuOK base will deprotonate the C6 carbon, as it is the only position where an enolate can form. This is generally favored as t-BuOK preferentially abstracts the less sterically hindered proton.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The enolate anion formed at C6 will attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a conjugate addition. The newly formed group, `-CH₂CH₂COOEt`, will preferentially occupy the sterically less hindered equatorial position on the cyclohexane ring for greater stability.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming**: The reaction creates a new carbon-carbon bond between the C6 of the original ketone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The principal functional group in the product is the ester, so the IUPAC name will be based on \"ethyl propanoate\".\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is now a substituent on the propanoate chain at position 3.\n    *   To name the substituent ring, we start numbering from the point of attachment as C1. The ketone group is on the adjacent carbon, so it becomes C2, receiving the lowest possible number. The original C6 had a methyl group, so the new C1 has a methyl group. The original C2, which has an ethyl and a methyl group, becomes the new C3.\n    *   Thus, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full IUPAC name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the nitro group) of 1-nitropropane. The resulting nitronate anion attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form the nitronate anion, `CH₃CH₂-CH(-)-NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The new bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   `[CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]⁻ + CH₃CH=CHCN → NC-CH(-)-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   Subsequent protonation by water yields the final product.\n    *   Product: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming**:\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the IUPAC name is based on the longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1. The longest chain is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n        `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full IUPAC name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option D matches both products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
