    "Based on the provided spectroscopic and chromatographic data, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers. This conclusion is supported by a detailed analysis of the observations in light of the chemical properties of different types of isomers.\n\n**Analysis of the Observations:**\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:** The observation of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, which together integrate to the expected one proton, is a classic sign of a diastereomeric mixture. Diastereomers are different chemical compounds with distinct physical properties. As a result, their corresponding protons exist in slightly different chemical environments, leading to separate signals in the NMR spectrum. The roughly equal integrals suggest that the two diastereomers are present in an approximately 1:1 ratio. This often occurs during peptide synthesis through a process called epimerization or racemization, where the stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon of an amino acid is partially or fully inverted. This is a known side-reaction in peptide synthesis, especially under basic conditions used during coupling steps, which can abstract the acidic alpha-proton.\n\n*   **LC-MS Analysis:** The presence of two well-separated peaks of equal intensity in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace further supports the diastereomer explanation. Because diastereomers have different physical properties, they can be separated using standard (achiral) chromatography techniques. The identical mass spectrum for both peaks confirms that the two compounds are isomers—they have the same molecular formula and mass—which rules out contamination by a precursor or a side-product with a different chemical formula.\n\n**Why Other Options are Unlikely:**\n\n*   **A) Contamination with a precursor:** A precursor molecule would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. This contradicts the finding that both LC peaks show the same mass.\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' side reaction:** A \"double coupling\" or similar side reaction would create a new molecule with a different mass (e.g., a dimer), which is inconsistent with the identical mass spectra observed.\n*   **C) Mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images that have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they are indistinguishable by standard NMR spectroscopy and will not separate on a standard (achiral) LC column, instead appearing as a single peak in both analyses. Differentiating enantiomers requires specialized chiral environments, such as a chiral chromatography column or chiral additives in the NMR solvent, which were not indicated.\n\nIn summary, the duplication of signals in the NMR and the separation into two peaks with identical mass in the LC-MS are hallmark characteristics of a diastereomeric mixture resulting from epimerization at an alpha-carbon during the chemical synthesis of the peptide.\n\n<<<D>>>"
