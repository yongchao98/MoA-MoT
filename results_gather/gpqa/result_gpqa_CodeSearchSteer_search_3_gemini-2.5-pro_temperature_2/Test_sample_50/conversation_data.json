    "To determine the net potential energy of the system, we employ the method of images. This technique replaces the grounded conducting sphere with an image charge that, along with the original charge, satisfies the condition that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.\n\nHere's the step-by-step derivation:\n1.  **Placement of the Image Charge**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, an image charge `q'` is placed along the same line.\n2.  **Magnitude and Location of the Image Charge**: The image charge `q'` has a magnitude of `-qR/d` and is located at a distance `d' = R²/d` from the center, within the sphere.\n3.  **Interaction Force**: The force between the real charge `q` and the grounded sphere is equivalent to the force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. This force is attractive.\n4.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. This can be calculated in two ways that yield the same result:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Integrating the force.** The potential energy `U` is the negative of the work done by the electric field as the charge `q` moves from infinity to `d`.\n        `U = -∫ F dr` from ∞ to `d`.\n        The force `F` on charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is the force due to the image charge:\n        `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - x')² = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)² = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n        Integrating this force from infinity to `d` gives the potential energy:\n        `U = -∫[∞ to d] (-k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²) dx = [ - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (x² - R²) ]` from ∞ to `d`.\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) - 0`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using the potential of the image charge.** The potential energy of a system of a charge and a grounded conductor is half the interaction energy between the charge and its image.\n        The potential energy of interaction (`U_interaction`) between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is:\n        `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (distance between them)`\n        The distance is `d - d' = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n        `U_interaction = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d) = - k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n        The total potential energy of the system `U` is `(1/2) * U_interaction`.\n        `U = (1/2) * [ - k * q² * R / (d² - R²) ] = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated expression matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
