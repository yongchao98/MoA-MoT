    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass\n\nFirst, we determine the chemical formula of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 by counting the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms:\n*   **(CH3)2C=**: 3 carbons, 6 hydrogens\n*   **=CH-**: 1 carbon, 1 hydrogen\n*   **-CH2-**: 1 carbon, 2 hydrogens\n*   **-CH(CH3)-**: 2 carbons, 4 hydrogens\n*   **-CH2-**: 1 carbon, 2 hydrogens\n*   **-CH=**: 1 carbon, 1 hydrogen\n*   **=C(CH3)2**: 3 carbons, 6 hydrogens\n\nSumming these up gives:\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nThe molar mass of C12H22 is calculated as:\n*   Molar Mass = (12 × 12.011 g/mol) + (22 × 1.008 g/mol) = 144.132 + 22.176 = **166.308 g/mol**.\n\n### Step 2: Count the Number and Types of Bonds\n\nNext, we identify all the chemical bonds in one molecule of the compound:\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are two C=C bonds in the structure.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** By drawing the structure or using the total number of carbons, we find there are 9 C-C single bonds.\n*   **C-H single bonds:** There are 22 C-H bonds, one for each hydrogen atom.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Energy Required to Atomize the Compound\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the energy needed to break all of its bonds. Using the provided bond energies:\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 bonds × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 bonds × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 bonds × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n\n**Total bond energy (enthalpy of atomization of the compound):**\n1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Constituent Elements\n\nThis is the energy required to form the gaseous atoms of the elements from their standard states (C(graphite) and H2(gas)).\n*   For 12 moles of carbon: 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   For 22 moles of hydrogen (from 11 moles of H2): 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\n**Total enthalpy of atomization of elements:**\n12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the total enthalpy of atomization of the elements and the total bond energy of the compound.\n\n*   **ΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of the compound)**\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\n*   **ΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 6: Convert the Answer to the Correct Units\n\nThe options provided are in kJ/mol and kJ/g. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's convert this to kJ/g using the molar mass calculated in Step 1.\n\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166.308 g/mol)\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) ≈ **11.424 kJ/g**\n\nThis value is very close to option A. The minor difference can be attributed to the precision of molar mass values used.\n\n*   **A) 11.44 kJ/g**\n*   B) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its enthalpy of formation).\n*   C) 67.4 kJ/mol\n*   D) 1900 kJ/g (The numerical value matches the result in kJ/mol, but the units are incorrect).\n\nBased on the calculation, 11.44 kJ/g is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
