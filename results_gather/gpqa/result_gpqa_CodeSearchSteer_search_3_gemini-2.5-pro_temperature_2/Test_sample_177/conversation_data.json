    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n### 1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action `S` is dimensionless. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density `L` over four-dimensional spacetime:\n`S = ∫ d⁴x L`\n\nFor `S` to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of 4.\n`[L] = M⁴`\n\n### 2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields\n\nWe determine the mass dimensions of the fields from their kinetic terms.\n\n*   **Fermion field ψ:** The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is `L_fermion = ψ̄(iγ^μ∂_μ)ψ`.\n    *   We know `[L] = M⁴` and the derivative `[∂_μ] = M¹`.\n    *   Therefore, `[ψ̄][∂_μ][ψ] = M⁴`.\n    *   `[ψ̄][ψ] * M¹ = M⁴`, which implies `[ψ̄][ψ] = M³`.\n    *   Assuming `[ψ̄] = [ψ]`, we get `2[ψ] = 3`, so `[ψ] = M^(3/2)`.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor F<sup>μν</sup>:** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_EM = -1/4 F_μν F^μν`.\n    *   We know `[L] = M⁴`.\n    *   Therefore, `[F_μν][F^μν] = M⁴`.\n    *   This gives `2[F^μν] = 4`, so `[F^μν] = M²`.\n\n*   **Sigma matrix σ<sub>μν</sub>:** This is defined as `σ_μν = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. The gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless. Consequently, `σ_μν` is also dimensionless.\n    *   `[σ_μν] = M⁰`.\n\n### 3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant κ\n\nNow, we use the interaction Lagrangian to find the mass dimension of κ.\n`L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_μν ψ F^μν`\n\nThe dimension of the interaction term must also be `M⁴`.\n`[L_int] = [κ][ψ̄][σ_μν][ψ][F^μν] = M⁴`\n\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n`[κ] * M^(3/2) * M⁰ * M^(3/2) * M² = M⁴`\n`[κ] * M^(3/2 + 3/2 + 2) = M⁴`\n`[κ] * M^(3 + 2) = M⁴`\n`[κ] * M⁵ = M⁴`\n\nSolving for `[κ]`:\n`[κ] = M^(4-5) = M⁻¹`\n\nSo, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n### 4. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nA key criterion for determining whether a theory is renormalizable by \"power counting\" is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n\n*   If all coupling constants have a non-negative mass dimension (`[g] ≥ 0`), the theory is generally renormalizable.\n*   If any coupling constant has a negative mass dimension (`[g] < 0`), the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nThe reason for this is that a negative mass dimension for a coupling constant leads to divergences in loop calculations that become progressively worse at higher orders of perturbation theory. These cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms, rendering the theory non-predictive at high energies.\n\nSince we found that `[κ] = -1`, which is negative, the theory described by this Lagrangian is non-renormalizable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension `[κ]` is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
