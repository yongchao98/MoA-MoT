    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a Very Large Telescope (VLT) Unit Telescope, we must evaluate two main criteria for each star:\n1.  Is the star visible from the Paranal Observatory in Chile?\n2.  Is the star bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 in a one-hour exposure?\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees south. For a star to be observable, it must rise above the horizon. Stars with very high northern declinations are not visible from southern latitudes.\n\nAccording to the ESPRESSO User Manual, for a one-hour (3600s) exposure in the high-resolution mode with a single Unit Telescope (HR), an S/N of 10 is achievable for stars as faint as an apparent magnitude of approximately V ≈ 17. Therefore, any star with an apparent magnitude brighter than (i.e., less than) 17 and visible from Paranal will be detectable.\n\nHere is the analysis for each star:\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility**: Canopus has a declination of about -52° 41'. This makes it a southern star, easily visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness**: It is the second-brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of about -0.74.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since -0.74 is significantly brighter than the V=17 limit and it is visible, **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility**: Polaris is the North Star, with a declination of approximately +89° 15'. From a latitude of 24.6° S, Polaris never rises above the horizon and is therefore impossible to observe.\n*   **Brightness**: Its apparent magnitude is around 2.0.\n*   **Conclusion**: Despite being bright enough, **Polaris is not detectable** because it is not visible from Paranal.\n\n**c) Star with RA=0°, DEC=0°, Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15, at 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility**: A declination of 0° places this star on the celestial equator, making it observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness**: The apparent magnitude (m) is calculated using the formula m = M - 5 + 5*log₁₀(d), where d is the distance in parsecs.\n    m = 15 - 5 + 5*log₁₀(10) = 10 + 5*(1) = 15.\n*   **Conclusion**: With an apparent magnitude of 15, it is brighter than the V=17 limit and is visible. **This star is detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with RA=0°, DEC=0°, Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15, at 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility**: The declination of 0° makes it observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness**: m = 15 - 5 + 5*log₁₀(200) ≈ 10 + 5*(2.301) ≈ 10 + 11.5 = 21.5.\n*   **Conclusion**: An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is fainter than the V=17 limit. **This star is not detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with RA=0°, DEC=0°, Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15, at 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility**: The declination of 0° makes it observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness**: m = 15 - 5 + 5*log₁₀(5) ≈ 10 + 5*(0.699) ≈ 10 + 3.5 = 13.5.\n*   **Conclusion**: With an apparent magnitude of 13.5, it is brighter than the V=17 limit and is visible. **This star is detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with RA=0°, DEC=0°, Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15, at 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility**: The declination of 0° makes it observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness**: m = 15 - 5 + 5*log₁₀(50) ≈ 10 + 5*(1.699) ≈ 10 + 8.5 = 18.5.\n*   **Conclusion**: An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the V=17 limit. **This star is not detectable.**\n\nIn summary, three stars on the list would be detectable: Canopus, the hypothetical star at 10 pc, and the hypothetical star at 5 pc.\n\n<<<B>>>"
