    "To arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **С6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**: The methyl group (`-CH3`) is an activating, ortho, para-directing group.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)**: The ester group (`-COOC2H5`) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**: The chloro group (`-Cl`) is a deactivating, ortho, para-directing group.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**: The nitro group (`-NO2`) is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**: The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is an activating, ortho, para-directing group.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)**: The carboxyl group (`-COOH`) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n### Analysis of Isomer Distribution\n\n**Meta-Directing Groups (4, 2, 6):**\nThese substituents direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position, meaning the yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4, C6H5-NO2):** The `-NO2` group is strongly deactivating. Bromination requires harsh conditions and almost exclusively produces the meta-isomer. Experimental data shows that outside of special conditions, the reaction gives nearly 100% meta-substituted product, meaning the para-isomer yield is practically zero or the lowest among all options.\n*   **Benzoic acid (6, C6H5-COOH) and Ethyl benzoate (2, C6H5-COOC2H5):** Both `-COOH` and `-COOC2H5` are deactivating and meta-directing. In electrophilic substitutions, the ester group in ethyl benzoate leads to predominantly meta-products, with a very small percentage of para-isomer (around 5% in nitration, which follows similar principles). Benzoic acid behaves similarly, yielding mainly the meta product. Between these two, their deactivating strengths are comparable, and both will produce very small amounts of para-isomer, but more than nitrobenzene. Published data for the bromination of ethyl benzoate shows predominantly meta-substitution. For benzoic acid, bromination also yields m-bromobenzoic acid as the major product.\n\nThus, for the meta-directors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is **4 < 6 ≈ 2**.\n\n**Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (1, 5, 3):**\nThese substituents direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The ratio between ortho and para products is largely determined by steric hindrance—larger substituents favor the formation of the para-isomer.\n*   **Toluene (1, C6H5-CH3) and Ethylbenzene (5, C6H5-C2H5):** Both `-CH3` and `-C2H5` are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is larger than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased steric bulk hinders the attack at the ortho positions more significantly, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. Therefore, the para yield for 5 will be greater than for 1.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3, C6H5-Cl):** The chloro group is deactivating but directs ortho and para. Halogens typically give a high percentage of the para-isomer, often higher than simple alkyl groups. For example, nitration of chlorobenzene yields 70% of the para-isomer, while nitration of toluene yields about 37-39% para product. Similar trends are expected for bromination. Studies on the bromination of toluene report a para-isomer yield of about 67%. For chlorobenzene, the para-selectivity is very high, often exceeding 95% under certain conditions.\n\nTherefore, for the ortho, para-directors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Final Arrangement\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the following order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Extremely low para-yield, close to 0%.\n2.  **Ethyl benzoate (2) & Benzoic acid (6):** Very low para-yield, but higher than nitrobenzene. In nitration, ethyl benzoate gives ~5% para. Let's assume benzoic acid is similar or slightly less.\n3.  **Toluene (1):** Moderate para-yield (bromination gives ~56-67% para).\n4.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Higher para-yield than toluene due to greater steric hindrance of the ethyl group.\n5.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Highest para-yield among the ortho, para directors, often exceeding 70-90%.\n\nTo sort 2 and 6 precisely, we consider their deactivating strength. `-COOH` is generally a stronger deactivator than `-COOR`. The stronger deactivation leads to higher meta selectivity, thus lower para yield. So, the order should be `6 < 2`.\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing the weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 (C6H5-NO2) < 6 (C6H5-COOH) < 2 (C6H5-COOC2H5) < 1 (C6H5-CH3) < 5 (C6H5-C2H5) < 3 (C6H5-Cl)**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
