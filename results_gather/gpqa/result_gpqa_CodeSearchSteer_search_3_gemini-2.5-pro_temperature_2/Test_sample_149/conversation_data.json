    "The final product of the reaction sequence is identified through a three-step analysis:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material:**\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO, and the degrees of unsaturation are calculated to be 5, suggesting a substituted benzene ring. The 1H-NMR data is interpreted as follows:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) coupled to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These peaks indicate a 1,4- (para) disubstituted benzene ring with an electron-donating group.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons strongly suggests a primary amino group (-NH2).\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde group.\n\nBased on this spectral data, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence:**\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a series of reactions:\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization):** The primary aromatic amine is converted into a diazonium salt. The amino group (-NH2) of 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde reacts to form 4-formylmethylbenzenediazonium chloride.\n*   **Step 2: H2O, Heat (Hydrolysis):** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water upon heating, replacing the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This step yields **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation):** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-protons. In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it undergoes a self-condensation reaction. First, an aldol addition occurs, where an enolate of one molecule attacks the carbonyl of a second molecule, forming a β-hydroxy aldehyde intermediate (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal). Due to the applied heat, this intermediate readily dehydrates to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product:**\nThe dehydration of the aldol addition product, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, results in the formation of **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This molecule is also known as (E)-2,4-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This matches the expected product from the self-aldol condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n*   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect, as the hydroxyl groups are missing.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final condensation product under heating conditions.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
