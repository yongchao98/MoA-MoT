    "To determine how long the journey to Earth will take from the astronaut's perspective, we need to use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n### 1. Identify Key Information:\n*   **Distance to Destination:** The spacecraft's destination is Earth, originating from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The distance to the LMC is approximately 163,000 light-years.\n*   **Spacecraft Speed (v):** 0.99999987 *c*, where *c* is the speed of light.\n*   **Astronaut's Age:** 22 solar years.\n*   **Average Alien Lifespan:** 150 solar years.\n\n### 2. Time Dilation Concept\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time for a moving object passes slower than for a stationary observer. This effect is known as time dilation. The time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time, Δt₀) is related to the time observed from Earth (the coordinate time, Δt) by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\n### 3. Calculation Steps:\n\n**a) Calculate the time of the journey as measured from Earth (Δt).**\n\nThe time it takes to travel a distance as measured by an observer on Earth is the distance divided by the speed. Since the speed is extremely close to the speed of light, we can approximate the travel time:\n\n*   Time (Earth) ≈ Distance / Speed of Light\n*   Δt ≈ 163,000 light-years / *c*\n*   Δt ≈ 163,000 years\n\n**b) Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n\nThe Lorentz factor determines the magnitude of time dilation and is calculated using the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nGiven v = 0.99999987 *c*:\n\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987*c)²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999974)\n*   γ = 1 / √0.00000026\n*   γ = 1 / 0.0005099\n*   γ ≈ 1961.16\n\n**c) Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (Δt₀).**\n\nThe time experienced by the traveling astronaut is the Earth-measured time divided by the Lorentz factor:\n\n*   Time (Astronaut) = Time (Earth) / γ\n*   Δt₀ = 163,000 years / 1961.16\n*   Δt₀ ≈ 83.11 years\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nFrom the point of view of the 22-year-old astronaut, the journey to Earth will take approximately 83.11 years.\n\n*   The astronaut's remaining lifespan is 150 - 22 = 128 years. Since the journey takes about 83 years from the astronaut's perspective, they will survive the trip.\n*   Upon arrival, the astronaut will have aged by 83.11 years, making them approximately 22 + 83.11 = 105.11 years old.\n*   Comparing the calculated travel time of ~83 years with the given options, the closest answer is 81 years. The slight discrepancy may arise from using a more precise distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud or a slightly different speed. However, based on the standard figures, ~83 years is the calculated duration. Option (C) is the most plausible choice among the given answers.\n\nBased on the calculation, the travel time for the astronaut is approximately 83 years. The closest option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
