    "The initial reasoning was sound, but it's always good to confirm the fundamental formulas.\n\nThe search results confirm the following:\n*   **Transit Probability**: For a planet on a circular orbit, the geometric probability of transit is approximately the ratio of the stellar radius (R_*) to the planet's semi-major axis (a). This confirms the formula `Prob ≈ R_star / a`.\n*   **Kepler's Third Law**: The relationship between orbital period (P), semi-major axis (a), and stellar mass (M_*) is given by `P² = (4π² / (G * M_*)) * a³`. This can be rearranged to show that the semi-major axis `a` is proportional to `(M_* * P²)^(1/3)`. This confirms the proportionality `a ∝ (M_* * P²)^(1/3)`.\n\nThe derivation performed in the internal thought process is therefore correct. Let's restate the steps for clarity.\n\n1.  **Define the goal:** Calculate the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (Prob_1) to that of Planet_2 (Prob_2).\n\n2.  **State the formula for transit probability:**\n    `Prob ∝ R_star / a`\n    Where `R_star` is the star's radius and `a` is the semi-major axis.\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law to express the semi-major axis (`a`) in terms of period (`P`) and stellar mass (`M_star`):**\n    `a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the expression for `a` into the probability formula:**\n    `Prob ∝ R_star / (M_star * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Set up the ratio for the two planets:**\n    `Ratio = Prob_1 / Prob_2 = [R_star1 / (M_star1 * P1²)^(1/3)] / [R_star2 / (M_star2 * P2²)^(1/3)]`\n\n6.  **Rearrange the terms:**\n    `Ratio = (R_star1 / R_star2) * [(M_star2 * P2²) / (M_star1 * P1²)]^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Plug in the given relationships between the two systems:**\n    *   The stars have the same radii: `R_star1 = R_star2`\n    *   Star_1's mass is twice Star_2's mass: `M_star1 = 2 * M_star2`\n    *   Planet_1's period is one-third of Planet_2's period: `P1 = P2 / 3` which means `P1² = P2² / 9`\n\n8.  **Substitute these into the ratio equation:**\n    `Ratio = (R_star2 / R_star2) * [(M_star2 * P2²) / ((2 * M_star2) * (P2² / 9))]^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `Ratio = 1 * [(M_star2 * P2²) / ((2/9) * M_star2 * P2²)]^(1/3)`\n    The `M_star2` and `P2²` terms cancel out.\n    `Ratio = [1 / (2/9)]^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (9/2)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n10. **Calculate the final numerical value:**\n    `Ratio ≈ 1.65096...`\n\nTherefore, Planet_1 is preferred for observation because its probability of transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
