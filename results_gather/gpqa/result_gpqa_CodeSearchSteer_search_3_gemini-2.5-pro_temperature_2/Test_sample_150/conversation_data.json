    "To find the probability that a measurement of the observable *P* will yield the value 0, we follow the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\nFirst, we need to find the eigenvector of the operator *P* that corresponds to the eigenvalue of 0. The eigenvalues (λ) are found by solving the characteristic equation det(*P* - λ*I*) = 0.\n\nThe operator *P* is given by the matrix:\n```\nP = [[0,   1/√2, 0],\n     [1/√2, 0,   1/√2],\n     [0,   1/√2, 0]]\n```\nThe characteristic equation is:\n```\ndet([[ -λ,   1/√2,   0   ],\n     [1/√2,  -λ,   1/√2 ],\n     [  0,   1/√2,   -λ  ]]) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - 1/√2(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ = 0\n```\nThis gives the eigenvalues λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.\n\nWe are interested in the eigenvalue λ = 0. The corresponding eigenvector |v₀⟩ is found by solving *P*|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩:\n```\n[[0,   1/√2, 0],    [x],   [0]\n [1/√2, 0,   1/√2],  * [y] = [0]\n [0,   1/√2, 0]]     [z]   [0]\n```\nThis results in the system of equations:\n1.  (1/√2) * y = 0  => y = 0\n2.  (1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0  => x + z = 0 => x = -z\n\nSo, the eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. To normalize this vector, we have `x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1`, which gives `2x² = 1`, so `x = 1/√2`. The normalized eigenvector |v₀⟩ corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 is `[1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`.\n\nNext, we must normalize the state vector of the system, |ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]. The norm squared is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`. The normalized state vector |ψ_norm⟩ is `(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`.\n\nFinally, the probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the corresponding eigenvector |v₀⟩ with the normalized state vector |ψ_norm⟩. This is calculated as `Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n\nThe inner product is:\n`⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] · [-1, 2, 1]`\n`= (1/√6) * [(1/√2)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1/√2)*(1)]`\n`= (1/√6) * [-1/√2 - 1/√2]`\n`= (1/√6) * [-2/√2]`\n`= (1/√6) * [-√2]`\n`= -√(2/6) = -√(1/3)`\n\nThe probability is the square of this value:\n`Prob(0) = |-√(1/3)|² = 1/3`\n\n<<<A>>>"
