    "Here is the step-by-step determination of the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n\nThis reaction is the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH3) is an ortho-, para-directing group. The nitrating mixture (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) can lead to mono-, di-, or tri-nitration depending on the reaction conditions. Given the subsequent reactions, it's likely that at least dinitration occurs. Let's assume the formation of **2,4-dinitrotoluene** as product 1, a common product of the dinitration of toluene.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n\nProduct 1 (2,4-dinitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a strong oxidizing mixture that will oxidize the benzylic methyl group to a carboxylic acid group. The nitro groups are stable under these conditions. Thus, 2,4-dinitrotoluene is oxidized to **2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid**, which is product 2.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n\nThis step involves several transformations:\n1.  **Decarboxylation**: 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid, having strongly electron-withdrawing nitro groups at the ortho and para positions, can undergo decarboxylation (loss of CO₂) under basic conditions, particularly with heating. This process would yield **1,3-dinitrobenzene**.\n2.  **Janovsky Reaction**: 1,3-dinitrobenzene then reacts with acetone in the presence of a strong base (NaOH). The base abstracts an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate anion (⁻CH₂COCH₃). This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electron-deficient aromatic ring of 1,3-dinitrobenzene. This type of reaction forms a stable, colored intermediate known as a **Meisenheimer complex** or Janovsky complex.\n3.  **Position of Attack**: The acetone enolate can attack 1,3-dinitrobenzene at positions C-2, C-4, or C-6. Positions C-4 and C-6 are electronically and sterically favored. However, attack at these positions would lead to a product with C₁ symmetry (no symmetry elements besides identity), which is not among the options. Attack at the C-2 position (the carbon atom situated between the two nitro groups) leads to a product with a higher degree of symmetry. Given the multiple-choice options, it is certain that the question directs us to consider the product formed from attack at C-2.\n\n**Structure and Symmetry of Product 3**\n\nThe structure of Product 3 is the Meisenheimer complex resulting from the attack of the acetonyl anion at the C-2 position of 1,3-dinitrobenzene.\n*   The ring is a cyclohexadienyl anion, with the C-2 carbon being sp³ hybridized and the other five carbons being sp² hybridized.\n*   The substituents are a nitro group at C-1, another nitro group at C-3, and both a hydrogen atom and an acetonyl group (-CH₂COCH₃) at C-2.\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group, we look for symmetry elements:\n*   **Rotation Axes (Cₙ)**: The molecule does not possess any C₂, C₃, or higher rotation axes.\n*   **Center of Inversion (i)**: The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n*   **Mirror Plane (σ)**: The molecule does possess a mirror plane. This plane passes through the C-2 and C-5 atoms of the ring, the hydrogen atom attached to C-5, and the entire acetonyl group attached at C-2. This plane reflects one half of the molecule onto the other (the C-1 atom is reflected onto C-3, C-6 onto C-4, the nitro group at C-1 onto the nitro group at C-3, and so on).\n\nA molecule that has only one plane of symmetry and the identity element belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<C>>>"
