    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound based on the provided spectral data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The peak is broad due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the structures lies in the complex splitting patterns described.\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four structures being saturated carboxylic acids.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates a proton is being split by three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    *   A single proton (methine, CH), causing a **d**oublet.\n    *   A group of two equivalent protons (methylene, CH₂), causing a **t**riplet.\n    *   A group of three equivalent protons (methyl, CH₃), causing a **q**uartet.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates a proton is split by three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    *   A single proton (methine, CH), causing a **d**oublet.\n    *   A group of two equivalent protons (methylene, CH₂), causing a **t**riplet.\n    *   Another group of two equivalent protons (another methylene, CH₂), causing a second **t**riplet.\n\n### 3. Structural Analysis of the Candidates\n\nLet's systematically determine the IUPAC names of the given condensed formulas and analyze the expected ¹H NMR splitting for the protons on their carbon backbones.\n\n*   **Candidate C: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n    *   This formula represents **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**: `(CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`.\n    *   Proton at C3: `H` is coupled to the `CH₂` at C2 (2H → triplet) and the `CH` at C4 (1H → doublet). This signal is a **triplet of doublets (td)**.\n    *   This structure does not contain protons that would give `dtq` or `dtt` signals.\n\n*   **Candidate D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n    *   This formula represents **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**: `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`.\n    *   Proton at C3: `H` is coupled to the `CH` at C2 (1H → doublet) and the `CH₂` at C4 (2H → triplet). This signal is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n    *   This structure does not contain protons that would give `dtq` or `dtt` signals.\n\n*   **Candidate B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n    *   This formula represents **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**: `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`.\n    *   Let's analyze the proton at C3. This proton is adjacent to three different carbons bearing protons: C2, C4, and the carbon of the ethyl group attached to C3.\n        *   Neighbor 1: The proton on C2 (a `CH` group) will split the C3-H signal into a **doublet**.\n        *   Neighbor 2: The two protons on C4 (a `CH₂` group) will split the C3-H signal into a **triplet**.\n        *   Neighbor 3: The two protons on the methylene (`CH₂`) of the ethyl group at C3 will also split the C3-H signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the proton at C3 gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This is a perfect match for one of the observed signals. Now we check for a `dtq`.\n    *   Let's analyze the diastereotopic methylene protons of any of the ethyl groups or the `CH₂` group on the main chain. For example, a proton in the `CH₂` group at C4. It is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H, doublet), its geminal partner proton (1H, doublet), and the `CH₃` group at C5 (3H, quartet). This results in a **doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq)**. This does not match the described `dtq` signal. However, the presence of a clear `dtt` makes this a very strong candidate, with a potential ambiguity or typo in the description of the second complex signal.\n\n*   **Candidate A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n    *   The most plausible interpretation of this condensed formula leads to **3-ethyl-4-methylheptanoic acid** (`CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂CH₂COOH`). *Note: A strict reading of the condensed formula results in a molecular formula of C₁₀H₁₈O₂, which implies an extra degree of unsaturation (a ring) as there are no vinyl protons. Assuming there's a typo in the condensed formula and a saturated acyclic structure is intended, we analyze the most logical structure.*\n    *   Proton at C3: `H` is adjacent to the `CH₂` at C2, the `CH` at C4, and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group. This gives a `t` x `d` x `t` signal, a **triplet of doublet of triplets (tdt)**. This set of neighbors (2H, 1H, 2H) is the same as for a `dtt`, so it is a plausible match.\n    *   Proton at C4: `H` is adjacent to the `CH` at C3, the `CH₂` at C5, and the `CH₃` of its methyl group. This gives a `d` x `t` x `q` signal, a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This is a perfect match for the other observed signal.\n    *   So, while the structure derived from (A) would match both NMR signals, the condensed formula as written does not correctly represent this structure and its implied molecular formula (`C₁₀H₁₈O₂`) contradicts the likely saturated acyclic nature.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMolecule **B (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)** definitively shows a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** for the proton at the C3 position. No other candidate provides this specific and complex splitting pattern from a correct interpretation of its formula. While the second signal (`dtq`) isn't perfectly matched (the structure gives `ddq` signals), it is the most plausible option. The `dtt` signal is a very strong piece of evidence that points directly to structure B. It is common in such problems for there to be slight ambiguity, and choosing the structure with the most definitive and unique match is the correct strategy.\n\n<<<B>>>"
