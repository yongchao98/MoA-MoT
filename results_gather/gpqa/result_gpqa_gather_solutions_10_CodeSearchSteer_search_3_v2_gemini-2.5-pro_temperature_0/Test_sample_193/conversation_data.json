Define the System and States**\n\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\nThe total number of possible microstates for the system is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.\n\nThe energy of a given state is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]\n\n**2.

Calculate the Energy for Each State**\n\nLet's list all 8 possible states and calculate their energies.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   **State 1:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n        E1 = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n    *   **State 2:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n        E2 = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n\n    There are **2 states** with energy **E = -3J**.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   **States with two spins up (+1) and one spin down (-1):**\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1) -> E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1) -> E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1) -> E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   **States with two spins down (-1) and one spin up (+1):**\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1) -> E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1) -> E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1) -> E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n\n    There are a total of 3 + 3 = **6 states** with energy **E = J**.\n\n**4. Construct the Partition Function**\n\nNow we can write the partition function by summing the contributions from all states. We can group the states by their energy levels and degeneracies (the number of states with that energy).\n\n*   Energy E1 = -3J has a degeneracy g1 = 2.\n*   Energy E2 = J has a degeneracy g2 = 6.\n\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2³ = 8 possible configurations. The energy of the system is given by the formula E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\nFirst, we will list all 8 possible spin configurations and calculate the energy for each one:\n\n1.  **All spins up:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n2.  **Two spins up, one spin down:**\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1) -> E = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1) -> E = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1) -> E = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    There are three states with this configuration, all having an energy of E = J.\n\n3.  **One spin up, two spins down:**\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1) -> E = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1) -> E = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1) -> E = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    There are three states with this configuration, all also having an energy of E = J.\n\n4.  **All spins down:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nNext, we group the states by their energy levels and count the number of states (degeneracy) for each energy level:\n\n*   **Energy E = -3J:** This energy level occurs for two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1). The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n*   **Energy E = J:** This energy level occurs for the remaining six states. The degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states, which can be calculated by summing over the energy levels multiplied by their degeneracies:\nZ = Σᵢ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\nZ = g₁ * e^(-β(-3J)) + g₂ * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\nB) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the System**: The system consists of three spins (S1, S2, S3), each of which can be +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2x2x2 = 8 possible configurations (states).\n2.  **Energy Calculation**: The energy for each state is given by the formula `E = -J * (S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3)`.\n3.  **Partition Function**: The partition function `Z` is the sum of the Boltzmann factors, `exp(-βE)`, over all possible states.\n4.  **Implementation**: I will write a Python script to:\n    *   Iterate through all 8 possible states of the three spins.\n    *   For each state, calculate its energy `E`.\n    *   Group the states by their energy level and count how many states (degeneracy) correspond to each energy level.\n    *   Construct the final expression for the partition function `Z` by summing the terms `(degeneracy) * exp(-βE)` for each unique energy level.\n    *   Compare the derived expression with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this plan:\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the partition function for a system of three spins.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Possible values for each spin\n    spins = [1, -1]\n    \n    # Store the energy values for all possible states\n    energy_levels = []\n    \n    # Iterate through all 2*2*2 = 8 states\n    for s1 in spins:\n        for s2 in spins:\n            for s3 in spins:\n                # The energy is E = -J * (S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3)\n                # We calculate the coefficient of -J\n                energy_coefficient = s1*s2 + s1*s3 + s2*s3\n                energy_levels.append(energy_coefficient)\n                \n    # Count the number of states (degeneracy) for each energy level\n    # The result will be a dictionary like {energy_coefficient: count}\n    # For example, {3: 2, -1: 6} means:\n    # - 2 states have energy E = -J * 3 = -3J\n    # - 6 states have energy E = -J * (-1) = J\n    degeneracy = collections.Counter(energy_levels)\n    \n    # Build the partition function string Z = sum(degeneracy * exp(-beta * E))\n    terms = []\n    for energy_coeff, count in sorted(degeneracy.items(), reverse=True):\n        # E = -J * energy_coeff\n        # exp(-beta*E) = exp(-beta*(-J*energy_coeff)) = exp(J*beta*energy_coeff)\n        if energy_coeff == 1:\n            term_str = f\"{count}e^(-J\\\\beta)\"\n        elif energy_coeff == -1:\n            term_str = f\"{count}e^(J\\\\beta)\"\n        else:\n            term_str = f\"{count}e^({energy_coeff}J\\\\beta)\"\n        terms.append(term_str)\n        \n    partition_function_str = \" + \".join(terms)\n    \n    # The options provided\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"Z= 2e^(3J\\\\beta)+6e^(-J\\\\beta)\",\n        \"B\": \"Z= 2e^(2J\\\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\\\beta)\",\n        \"C\": \"Z= 6e^(2J\\\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\\\beta)\",\n        \"D\": \"Z= 2e^(-3J\\\\beta)+6e^(J\\\\beta)\"\n    }\n    \n    # Find the correct option\n    correct_option = None\n    # A simplified representation for comparison\n    derived_simple_str = \"Z= \" + \" + \".join(sorted(terms))\n    \n    for option, value in options.items():\n        # Also sort the terms in the option for robust comparison\n        parts = value.replace(\"Z= \", \"\").split('+')\n        option_simple_str = \"Z= \" + \" + \".join(sorted(parts))\n        if derived_simple_str == option_simple_str:\n            correct_option = option\n            break\n            \n    print(\"The possible states and their corresponding energy coefficients (E / -J) are:\")\n    print(f\"Energy coefficients: {energy_levels}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe degeneracy of each energy level is:\")\n    print(f\"Degeneracy: {dict(degeneracy)}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis means there are:\")\n    print(f\"- {degeneracy[3]} states with energy E = -3J\")\n    print(f\"- {degeneracy[-1]} states with energy E = J\")\n    print(\"\\nThe partition function Z is the sum of Boltzmann factors for all states:\")\n    print(f\"Z = {degeneracy[3]} * exp(-β*(-3J)) + {degeneracy[-1]} * exp(-β*J)\")\n    print(f\"Z = {partition_function_str}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nComparing with the given options:\")\n    for option, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{option}) {value}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe correct option is: {correct_option}\")\n\nsolve_partition_function()\n<<<A>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 83\n    <<<A>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z for the given system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its States**\n\n*   The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can take a value of +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n*   The total number of possible configurations (microstates) for the system is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Understand the Energy Function**\n\n*   The energy of any given state is determined by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ].\n*   We need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible microstates.\n\n**3. Define the Partition Function**\n\n*   The canonical partition function (Z) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all possible microstates:\n    Z = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n    where β = 1/(kT).\n*   A more efficient way to calculate this is to group states with the same energy (degeneracy) and sum them up:\n    Z = Σ_levels g_i * e^(-βE_i)\n    where g_i is the degeneracy (number of states) of the energy level E_i.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nLet's list all 8 states, calculate the term [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3], and then find the energy E for each state.\n\n| State | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1S2 | S1S3 | S2S3 | Sum = [S1S2+S1S3+S2S3] | Energy E = -J * Sum |\n| :---: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--------------------: | :------------------: |\n|   1   | +1 | +1 | +1 |  +1  |  +1  |  +1  |           +3           |         -3J          |\n|   2   | +1 | +1 | -1 |  +1  |  -1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   3   | +1 | -1 | +1 |  -1  |  +1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   4   | -1 | +1 | +1 |  -1  |  -1  |  +1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   5   | +1 | -1 | -1 |  -1  |  -1  |  +1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   6   | -1 | +1 | -1 |  -1  |  +1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   7   | -1 | -1 | +1 |  +1  |  -1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   8   | -1 | -1 | -1 |  +1  |  +1  |  +1  |           +3           |         -3J          |\n\n**5. Group States by Energy (Find Degeneracy)**\n\nFrom the table, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels.\n\n*   **Energy Level 1 (E1):**\n    *   E1 = -3J\n    *   The states with this energy are State 1 (+1, +1, +1) and State 8 (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The number of states (degeneracy) for this energy level is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2 (E2):**\n    *   E2 = +J\n    *   The states with this energy are States 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n    *   The number of states (degeneracy) for this energy level is g2 = 6.\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to miscalculate the number of states for each energy level. It's crucial to list all 8 states or use combinatorics (e.g., \"all spins up/down\" vs. \"one spin flipped\") to correctly determine the degeneracies. Here, the total number of states is 2 + 6 = 8, which confirms we have accounted for all possibilities.\n\n**6. Construct the Partition Function Z**\n\nNow, we use the formula Z = Σ g_i * e^(-βE_i).\n\n*   Contribution from E1: g1 * e^(-βE1) = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ)\n*   Contribution from E2: g2 * e^(-βE2) = 6 * e^(-β(+J)) = 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nSumming these contributions gives the total partition function:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**7.

The energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\n**1. Understanding the System and States**\n\nThe system has three components (spins), and each can be in one of two states (+1 or -1). Therefore, the total number of possible microstates for the system is 2^3 = 8. We need to list all these states and calculate the energy for each.\n\nA state is defined by the triplet (S1, S2, S3).\n\n**2. Calculating the Energy for Each State**\n\nThe energy depends on the sum of the products of the spins: S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's calculate this sum for all 8 possible states.\n\n*   **State 1: All spins up**\n    (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    Energy E = -J(3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 2: All spins down**\n    (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    Energy E = -J(3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 3: One spin down, two spins up** (3 possibilities)\n    *   (+1, +1, -1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (1)(1)+(1)(-1)+(1)(-1) = 1-1-1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   (+1, -1, +1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (1)(-1)+(1)(1)+(-1)(1) = -1+1-1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   (-1, +1, +1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (-1)(1)+(-1)(1)+(1)(1) = -1-1+1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n\n*   **State 4: One spin up, two spins down** (3 possibilities)\n    *   (+1, -1, -1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (1)(-1)+(1)(-1)+(-1)(-1) = -1-1+1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   (-1, +1, -1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (-1)(1)+(-1)(-1)+(1)(-1) = -1+1-1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   (-1, -1, +1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (-1)(-1)+(-1)(1)+(-1)(1) = 1-1-1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n\n**3. Grouping States by Energy (Degeneracy)**\n\nWe have found two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy E1 = -3J:** This energy level corresponds to the two states where all spins are aligned, either all up or all down. The degeneracy (number of states) is g1 = 2.\n*   **Energy E2 = J:** This energy level corresponds to the six states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two. The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\n(Check: Total states = g1 + g2 = 2 + 6 = 8. This is correct.)\n\n**4. Calculating the Partition Function (Z)**\n\nThe partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors, e^(-βE), over all states. We can write this as a sum over the energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\n\nZ = Σ_levels (degeneracy) * e^(-β * Energy)\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\n\nThe calculated partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ).\nLet's compare this with the given choices:\n\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nOur result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum over all possible states of the system.

Understand the System and its States**\n*   The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can take a value of +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n*   The total number of possible configurations (microstates) of the system is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Understand the Energy of the System**\n*   The energy of any given state is defined by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ].\n*   We need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible states.\n\n**3. Understand the Partition Function**\n*   The canonical partition function (Z) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all possible microstates.\n*   The formula is: Z = Σ_i exp(-β * E_i), where the sum is over all 8 states, and β = 1/(kT).\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nIt is inefficient to calculate the energy for all 8 states one by one. A more careful approach is to group the states by their configuration type, which will lead to the same energy value.\n\n**Case 1: All three spins are aligned.**\nThis happens in two states:\n*   State 1: (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    Energy E1 = -J [ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J.\n*   State 2: (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    Energy E2 = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** There are **2 states** that have an energy of **-3J**. The degeneracy for this energy level is 2.\n\n**Case 2: Two spins are aligned, and one is anti-aligned.**\nThis happens in the remaining 8 - 2 = 6 states. Let's verify their energy.\n*   Subcase 2a: Two spins are +1, one is -1.\n    There are three such states: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), and (-1, +1, +1).\n    Let's calculate the energy for one of them, e.g., (+1, +1, -1):\n    Energy E = -J [ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J [ -1 ] = +J.\n    By symmetry, all three of these states will have the same energy.\n*   Subcase 2b: Two spins are -1, one is +1.\n    There are three such states: (-1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, -1), and (+1, -1, -1).\n    Let's calculate the energy for one of them, e.g., (-1, -1, +1):\n    Energy E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J [ -1 ] = +J.\n    Again, by symmetry, all three of these states will have the same energy.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** There are a total of 3 + 3 = **6 states** that have an energy of **+J**. The degeneracy for this energy level is 6.\n\n**4. Assemble the Partition Function**\nNow, we can write the partition function by summing the Boltzmann factors for each energy level, multiplied by its degeneracy (g).\nZ = Σ_levels g * exp(-βE)\n\n*   Contribution from the E = -3J level (degeneracy g=2):\n    2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) = 2 * exp(3Jβ)\n*   Contribution from the E = +J level (degeneracy g=6):\n    6 * exp(-β * (+J)) = 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nSumming these contributions gives the total partition function:\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\n**Final Answer**\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta) - Incorrect\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta) - Incorrect\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta) - Incorrect\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta) - Correct\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

List All Possible Microstates and Calculate Their Energies**\n\nWe need to consider all 8 possible combinations of (S1, S2, S3) and calculate the energy for each one. A careful point here is to systematically list all states to avoid missing any.\n\nLet's calculate the term X = S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 for each state. The energy will then be E = -J*X.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are parallel.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): X = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3.  Energy E = -3J.\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Energy E = -3J.\n    *   So, there are **2 states** with an energy of **E = -3J**.\n\n*   **Case 2: Two spins are parallel, one is anti-parallel.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1): X = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1.

This matches our initial count, so our state enumeration is correct.\n\n**4. Calculate the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all energy levels of the degeneracy of that level multiplied by its Boltzmann factor.\nZ = g1 * exp(-β*E1) + g2 * exp(-β*E2)\n\nSubstitute the values we found:\nZ = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * (+J))\n\nSimplifying the exponents gives:\nZ = 2 * exp(3βJ) + 6 * exp(-βJ)\n\n*Careful Point:* Pay close attention to the signs. The formula has a negative sign, -βE. When the energy E is negative (like -3J), the exponent becomes positive (-β * -3J = +3βJ). When the energy E is positive (like +J), the exponent remains negative (-β * +J = -βJ).\n\n**5.

The energy E is given by the equation E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3], and each spin can be either +1 or -1.\n\nFirst, we identify all possible spin configurations and calculate the corresponding energy for each. There are 2³ = 8 possible states for the three spins.\n\nThe states can be grouped by their energy levels:\n\n**Group 1: All spins are aligned (either all up or all down).**\n*   **State (+1, +1, +1):**\n    E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n*   **State (-1, -1, -1):**\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nFor the energy level E₁ = -3J, there are 2 states.

    "To determine the final answer for the partition function Z, let's break down the calculation step-by-step. This approach will allow us to verify the methodologies used by the various agents and identify the correct result.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\n**1. System Definition:**\nThe system consists of three spins, S₁, S₂, and S₃. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. This results in a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates for the system.\n\n**2. Energy Equation:**\nThe energy of any given state is defined by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ ]\n\n**3. Partition Function Definition:**\nThe partition function, Z, is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, `e^(-βE)`, over all possible states of the system:\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\nA more efficient way to calculate this is to group states that have the same energy level. If an energy level Eᵢ has gᵢ states (a degeneracy of gᵢ), the formula becomes:\nZ = Σ_levels gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Enumerate all microstates and calculate their energies.**\n\nIt is most efficient to group the 8 states by their configuration type to determine the energy levels and their degeneracies.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    This category includes two states:\n    *   (S₁, S₂, S₃) = (+1, +1, +1):\n        E = -J[ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n    *   (S₁, S₂, S₃) = (-1, -1, -1):\n        E = -J[ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n    *   **Careful Point:** We have identified an energy level of **E₁ = -3J** with a degeneracy of **g₁ = 2**.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    This category includes the remaining 6 states. Let's calculate the energy for a representative state, for example (+1, +1, -1):\n    *   (S₁, S₂, S₃) = (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J[ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) ] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the energy equation, all 6 states where one spin is different from the other two will have this same energy. The 6 states are: (+1,+1,-1), (+1,-1,+1), (-1,+1,+1), (+1,-1,-1), (-1,+1,-1), and (-1,-1,+1).\n    *   **Careful Point:** We have found a second energy level of **E₂ = +J** with a degeneracy of **g₂ = 6**.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the enumeration.**\nThe sum of the degeneracies should equal the total number of states: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8. This is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the Partition Function Z.**\n\nNow we substitute the energy levels and their degeneracies into the partition function formula:\nZ = g₁e^(-βE₁) + g₂e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(+J))\n\n**Careful Point:** Pay close attention to the signs in the exponent. The formula `e^(-βE)` means the sign of the energy E is flipped.\n*   For E₁ = -3J, the exponent becomes -β(-3J) = +3Jβ.\n*   For E₂ = +J, the exponent becomes -β(+J) = -Jβ.\n\nThis gives the final expression:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe final calculated expression for the partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ). Now, we compare this to the provided options:\n\nA) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\nB) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\nD) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\n\nThe calculated result exactly matches option A. Most of the provided candidate answers correctly performed the calculation but made errors in matching their result to the labeled options, which appeared to be shuffled. Based on a rigorous, step-by-step analysis, option A is the correct one.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nLet's list all 8 states, calculate the term [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3], and then find the energy E for each state.\n\n| State | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1S2 | S1S3 | S2S3 | Sum = [S1S2+S1S3+S2S3] | Energy E = -J * Sum |\n| :---: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--------------------: | :------------------: |\n|   1   | +1 | +1 | +1 |  +1  |  +1  |  +1  |           +3           |         -3J          |\n|   2   | +1 | +1 | -1 |  +1  |  -1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   3   | +1 | -1 | +1 |  -1  |  +1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   4   | -1 | +1 | +1 |  -1  |  -1  |  +1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   5   | +1 | -1 | -1 |  -1  |  -1  |  +1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   6   | -1 | +1 | -1 |  -1  |  +1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   7   | -1 | -1 | +1 |  +1  |  -1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   8   | -1 | -1 | -1 |  +1  |  +1  |  +1  |           +3           |         -3J          |\n\n**5. Group States by Energy (Find Degeneracy)**\n\nFrom the table, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels.\n\n*   **Energy Level 1 (E1):**\n    *   E1 = -3J\n    *   The states with this energy are State 1 (+1, +1, +1) and State 8 (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The number of states (degeneracy) for this energy level is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2 (E2):**\n    *   E2 = +J\n    *   The states with this energy are States 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n    *   The number of states (degeneracy) for this energy level is g2 = 6.\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to miscalculate the number of states for each energy level. It's crucial to list all 8 states or use combinatorics (e.g., \"all spins up/down\" vs. \"one spin flipped\") to correctly determine the degeneracies. Here, the total number of states is 2 + 6 = 8, which confirms we have accounted for all possibilities.\n\n**6. Construct the Partition Function Z**\n\nNow, we use the formula Z = Σ g_i * e^(-βE_i).\n\n*   Contribution from E1: g1 * e^(-βE1) = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ)\n*   Contribution from E2: g2 * e^(-βE2) = 6 * e^(-β(+J)) = 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nSumming these contributions gives the total partition function:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**7.

The energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\n**1. Understanding the System and States**\n\nThe system has three components (spins), and each can be in one of two states (+1 or -1). Therefore, the total number of possible microstates for the system is 2^3 = 8. We need to list all these states and calculate the energy for each.\n\nA state is defined by the triplet (S1, S2, S3).\n\n**2. Calculating the Energy for Each State**\n\nThe energy depends on the sum of the products of the spins: S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's calculate this sum for all 8 possible states.\n\n*   **State 1: All spins up**\n    (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    Energy E = -J(3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 2: All spins down**\n    (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    Energy E = -J(3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 3: One spin down, two spins up** (3 possibilities)\n    *   (+1, +1, -1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (1)(1)+(1)(-1)+(1)(-1) = 1-1-1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   (+1, -1, +1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (1)(-1)+(1)(1)+(-1)(1) = -1+1-1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   (-1, +1, +1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (-1)(1)+(-1)(1)+(1)(1) = -1-1+1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n\n*   **State 4: One spin up, two spins down** (3 possibilities)\n    *   (+1, -1, -1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (1)(-1)+(1)(-1)+(-1)(-1) = -1-1+1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   (-1, +1, -1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (-1)(1)+(-1)(-1)+(1)(-1) = -1+1-1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   (-1, -1, +1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (-1)(-1)+(-1)(1)+(-1)(1) = 1-1-1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n\n**3. Grouping States by Energy (Degeneracy)**\n\nWe have found two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy E1 = -3J:** This energy level corresponds to the two states where all spins are aligned, either all up or all down. The degeneracy (number of states) is g1 = 2.\n*   **Energy E2 = J:** This energy level corresponds to the six states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two. The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\n(Check: Total states = g1 + g2 = 2 + 6 = 8. This is correct.)\n\n**4. Calculating the Partition Function (Z)**\n\nThe partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors, e^(-βE), over all states. We can write this as a sum over the energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\n\nZ = Σ_levels (degeneracy) * e^(-β * Energy)\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**5.

This matches our initial count, so our state enumeration is correct.\n\n**4. Calculate the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all energy levels of the degeneracy of that level multiplied by its Boltzmann factor.\nZ = g1 * exp(-β*E1) + g2 * exp(-β*E2)\n\nSubstitute the values we found:\nZ = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * (+J))\n\nSimplifying the exponents gives:\nZ = 2 * exp(3βJ) + 6 * exp(-βJ)\n\n*Careful Point:* Pay close attention to the signs. The formula has a negative sign, -βE. When the energy E is negative (like -3J), the exponent becomes positive (-β * -3J = +3βJ). When the energy E is positive (like +J), the exponent remains negative (-β * +J = -βJ).\n\n**5.
