The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\n\nA) 29\nB) 25\nC) 31\nD) 35\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Gas W:** The clue states that gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some common simple gases (using the most common isotopes):\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons.\n    *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Match)\n    *   O₂: 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (Match)\n    *   CO: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Match)\n    *   HF: 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (Match)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Match)\n    The first clue mentions a \"heavier isotope,\" which makes D₂ a very strong candidate for gas W.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance B:** The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction:** Since heating G produces D₂O (B), G must be a compound that contains D₂O (like a deuterated hydrate) or can decompose to form it (like a metal deuteroxide). The overall reaction is:\n    X + Y (liquid) → W (gas) + G (precipitate)\n    If W is D₂ and the reaction involves D₂O, a plausible reaction is a strong reducing agent reacting with heavy water (D₂O). Let's assume Y is D₂O.\n    X + D₂O → D₂ + G\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   The clue \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\" points to X being a strong reducing agent. A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has at least three oxygen atoms. A reduction that produces a product with two oxygens would be the conversion of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to alcohol groups (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This is characteristic of strong reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   The clue \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" fits perfectly. LiAlH₄ is a powerful and common reagent, and its \"very close analog\" is Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), another extremely common reagent.\n    *   The first clue states X incorporates a \"heavier isotope.\" The deuterated version of LiAlH₄ is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**. This is a common reagent for introducing deuterium into molecules.\n\n5.  **Verify the entire reaction sequence with X = LiAlD₄:**\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄. It contains the heavier isotope Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Liquid Y:** D₂O (heavy water).\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is known to be violent, consistent with the clue.\n    *   **Gas W:** D₂. As determined in step 1, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide). This is the deuterated analog of Al(OH)₃, which is a precipitate. This fits.\n    *   **Heating G:** 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O.\n    *   **Substance B:** D₂O. Its melting point is ~277 K. This fits.\n    All clues are consistent with **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes.\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The mass numbers of the specific isotopes are: D = 2, Li = 7 (most common isotope), Al = 27 (only stable isotope).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as D, mass number 2).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (mass number 27).\n    *   The instruction states, \"...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we must account for all four deuterium atoms.\n    *   Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 atom × 27 = 27.\n    *   Total cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the information provided:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C), while the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). Given the clue about a heavier isotope, B is identified as **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released in a reaction and its molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's consider the reaction that produces B (D₂O). Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide. The violent reaction of X with liquid Y produces gas W and precipitate G. If the final products involve deuterium, it is highly likely that the reactants do as well. A plausible candidate for gas W is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify Liquid Y:** For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, the deuterated substance X must react with a deuterium source. This makes liquid Y **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is consistent with the identification of substance B.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** Substance X contains a heavy isotope, is a reagent in organic chemistry, and reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. A prime candidate for X is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is violent.\n    *   **Gas W:** D₂ is produced, which matches our earlier deduction.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, would form a precipitate.\n    *   **Heating G:** When heated, aluminum hydroxide (and by extension, deuteroxide) decomposes to form aluminum oxide and water (or in this case, D₂O, which is substance B).\n    *   **Organic Reagent:** LiAlD₄ and its common analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), are powerful and widely used reducing agents in organic chemistry.\n    *   **Reaction with Keto Acid:** A keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) when reduced by a strong agent like LiAlH₄ (or LiAlD₄) yields a diol (containing 2 oxygen atoms), which matches the description.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (present as 4 atoms of the Deuterium isotope).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (present as 1 atom).\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   We will use the mass numbers for this calculation, as the options are integers.\n    *   Mass number of Deuterium (D) is 2.\n    *   Mass number of Aluminum (Al) is 27.\n\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Deuterium):** 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Total Cumulative Mass:** 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Chemical Riddle:** I will analyze the clues provided to identify the unknown substances, particularly Substance X.\n    *   **Clue 1: Melting point of B.** The melting point of B is ~277 K, which is approximately 4°C. This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O). So, B is D₂O.\n    *   **Clue 2: Formation of B.** B (D₂O) is released when precipitate G is heated. This implies G is a deuterated hydrate or hydroxide, like a metal deuteroxide, which decomposes upon heating.\n    *   **Clue 3: The Reaction.** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. This is a classic pattern for a reactive metal hydride/deuteride reacting with water/heavy water.\n    *   **Clue 4: Gas W.** Gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. If the reaction involves deuterated compounds, a likely candidate for W is deuterium gas, D₂ (2 protons, 2 neutrons).\n    *   **Clue 5: Putting it together.** If X is a deuteride and it reacts with Y=D₂O, the reaction would be: `Metal-Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) -> Metal-Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`. This is consistent with all clues so far.\n    *   **Clue 6: Organic Chemistry Context.** X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its reaction with a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a strong reducing agent, capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol (which has 2 oxygens).\n    *   **Clue 7: Identifying X.** A very common strong reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits all the clues perfectly. It reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and precipitates of LiOD and Al(OD)₃. Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its heavier isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The problem asks for the cumulative atomic mass of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Mass of all Hydrogen atoms: There are 4 Deuterium (D) atoms. The mass of one D atom is ~2 amu. Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of all Aluminum atoms: There is 1 Aluminum (Al) atom. The mass of the stable isotope of Al is ~27 amu. Total mass = 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   The final sum is 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will define the counts and masses of the identified atoms and perform the final summation.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

We need a molecule with an equal number of protons (p) and neutrons (n).\n        *   H₂: 2p, 0n. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D has 1p and 1n. So D₂ has 2p and 2n. **This is a perfect match.**\n        *   CO₂: C(6p, 6n), O(8p, 8n). Total = 22p, 22n. **This is also a match.**\n        *   N₂O: N(7p, 7n), O(8p, 8n). Total = 22p, 22n. **This is also a match.**\n    *   However, the formation of D₂ gas strongly aligns with the \"heavier isotope\" clue. A violent reaction producing D₂ suggests a powerful deuteride reacting with a deuterium source.\n    *   The most common liquid deuterium source (Liquid Y) is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   So, we hypothesize: **X is a deuteride, Y is D₂O, and W is D₂.**\n\n*   **Clue 3:** \"...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   277 K is approximately 4 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is \"very close to 277 K\". So, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   G is a precipitate that releases D₂O upon heating. This means G is a deuterated hydroxide (a metal hydroxide containing D instead of H).\n    *   Let's test potential candidates for X (strong deuterides):\n        *   If X = NaBD₄ (Sodium borodeuteride): `NaBD₄ + 4 D₂O → NaB(OD)₄ + 4 D₂`. The product, sodium borate, is soluble. No precipitate G would form.\n        *   If X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium aluminum deuteride): `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4 D₂(g)`. Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate. This fits the description of G.\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause decomposition: `2 Al(OD)₃(s) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3 D₂O(g)`. This releases B (D₂O).\n    *   This confirms that **X = LiAlD₄**, **Y = D₂O**, **W = D₂**, **G = Al(OD)₃**, and **B = D₂O**.\n\n*   **Clue 4:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH).\n    *   X (LiAlD₄) is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   `R-CO-COOH + LiAlD₄ → (intermediate) → (after workup) → R-CD(OH)-CD₂OH`\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This clue is consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Clue 5:** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   X is LiAlD₄. Its \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄ (Lithium aluminum hydride), which is one of the most common and powerful reducing agents in synthetic organic chemistry. This strongly confirms our identification.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the required value.**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope, Deuterium, D).\n*   We identify the lightest and heaviest elements by their atomic number (number of protons).\n    *   Hydrogen (H/D): Atomic Number = 1  **(Lightest)**\n    *   Lithium (Li): Atomic Number = 3\n    *   Aluminum (Al): Atomic Number = 13 **(Heaviest)**\n*   The question specifies to sum the masses of all instances of these elements. We will use the mass number (protons + neutrons) for the calculation.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of Deuterium (D₄). The mass number of Deuterium (¹p + ¹n) is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum. The most stable and common isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** We sum the total masses from the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass from Hydrogen isotopes) + (Mass from Aluminum isotopes)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n**Step 3: Final Answer.**\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle to determine Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Identification\n\n1.  **Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is stated to be \"very close to 277 K\". The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K, which is approximately 3.82°C. This is remarkably close to 277 K, strongly suggesting that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0°C), which is not as close.\n\n2.  **Precipitate G**: Precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a deuterated hydroxide, which decomposes upon heating to form a metal oxide and heavy water. A plausible candidate for such a precipitate is aluminum hydroxide's deuterated analog, **Al(OD)₃**. Upon heating, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n\n3.  **Substance X and its Reaction**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W and precipitate G.\n    *   **Gas W**: The problem states that the molecules of gas W have an equal number of protons and neutrons. Deuterium gas (**D₂**) fits this description perfectly. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Substance X**: A reagent used in organic chemistry that contains a heavier isotope and reacts to form the products identified above is **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. It is a powerful reducing agent and a close analog of the very common Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Liquid Y**: For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, LiAlD₄ would need to react with a source of deuterium, making **heavy water (D₂O)** the logical identity for liquid Y.\n    *   **The Reaction**: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4D₂ (gas W). This reaction is known to be violent, similar to the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water.\n\n4.  **Confirmation with Keto Acid Reaction**: The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, totaling 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (-CD₂(OH)). The resulting product, a diol, would contain 2 oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the clue.\n\n### Calculation\n\nHaving confidently identified Substance X as **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, we can proceed with the calculation.\n\n1.  **Elements in Substance X**: The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its heavier isotope, Deuterium, D).\n\n2.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**:\n    *   Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Z=13).\n\n3.  **Sum of Atomic Masses**: The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule, summing all isotopes of each. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation as implied by the answer choices.\n    *   **Mass of the Lightest Element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms of the Deuterium (²H) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass of the Heaviest Element (Aluminum)**: There is one atom of Aluminum. The most common and stable isotope is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n\n4.  **Cumulative Sum**:\n    *   Sum = (Mass of all Deuterium atoms) + (Mass of all Aluminum atoms)\n    *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses.\n\n### Identification of the Substances\n\n1.  **Substance B**: The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K. This is approximately 3.85°C or 38.9°F. This value is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O).\n\n2.  **Substance X and its Isotope**: The presence of heavy water (D₂O) as a product strongly suggests that the heavier isotope in Substance X is deuterium (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n3.  **Organic Chemistry Context**: The problem states that Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. It also mentions that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group. A powerful reducing agent would reduce both groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of Substance X.\n\n4.  **Reaction with Liquid Y**: LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic solvents like water. Let's test the reaction with heavy water (D₂O) as Liquid Y.\n    *   **Reaction**: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n    *   **Gas W**: The gas released is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium molecule (D₂) consists of two deuterons, each having 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, the molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the description that the number of protons and neutrons are equal.\n    *   **Precipitate G**: The products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). While LiOD is soluble, Al(OD)₃ is insoluble and would form a precipitate.\n    *   **Heating G**: When aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) is heated, it decomposes to aluminium oxide and water. Similarly, heating aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) would release heavy water (B, D₂O).\n\nAll clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄). The phrasing \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" is a key instruction.\n\n1.  **Elements in LiAlD₄**: The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n\n2.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**:\n    *   Based on atomic number and mass, Hydrogen is the lightest element, and Aluminium is the heaviest element.\n\n3.  **Summing the Masses**:\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms of the lightest element, all of which are the deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of deuterium is 2. Therefore, the total mass contributed by the lightest element is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium)**: There is one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminium (Al). The mass number of the most common isotope of aluminium is 27.\n\n4.  **Cumulative Mass**: The cumulative mass is the sum of the total masses of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass of Hydrogen isotopes) + (Total mass of Aluminium isotopes)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThus, the cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the clues provided:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is close to 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This strongly suggests that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G:** Precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a deuterated hydroxide. Given the subsequent reactions, **G is aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**. Heating Al(OD)₃ causes it to decompose into aluminum oxide and heavy water (2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O).\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) and a gas W. The clue that \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common reducing agents. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful and widely used reducing agent. Its close analog containing a heavier isotope of hydrogen would be **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits the description of substance X.\n\n4.  **Identify Gas W and Confirm the Reaction:** If X is LiAlD₄, it would react with a deuterated solvent to produce the precipitate Al(OD)₃. Let's assume liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O). The reaction would be:\n    LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n\n    Now, let's check if gas W (D₂) fits the description \"its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   A deuterium (D) atom contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A D₂ molecule, therefore, contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    This matches the description perfectly. Thus, the identified substances and the reaction are consistent with all the clues.\n\n5.  **Verify the Keto Acid Reaction:** The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. A keto acid contains both a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. The reduction of both of these functional groups would result in a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains two oxygen atoms. This confirms the identity of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n    *   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1). In LiAlD₄, it is present as 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13). In LiAlD₄, it is present as 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the stable isotope of aluminum is 27.\n    *   **Intermediate Element:** Lithium (Atomic Number 3). The most common isotope has a mass number of 7.\n\n    The question asks for the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n\n    *   **Total mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium):** There are 4 deuterium atoms. Mass = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 aluminum atom. Mass = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n    **Cumulative Atomic Mass** = (Total mass of Deuterium) + (Total mass of Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is very close to the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   Therefore, substance B is D₂O.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G and Gas W:**\n    *   Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a compound that contains deuterium and oxygen and decomposes upon heating to release D₂O. A metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, is a likely candidate, as it would decompose to a metal oxide and D₂O (e.g., Ca(OD)₂ → CaO + D₂O).\n    *   Gas W is released during the reaction and its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple molecules:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely in this context)\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely)\n    *   Given that D₂O is involved, the most plausible identity for gas W is D₂.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Substances X and Y:**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ).\n    *   The reaction produces both D₂ and M(OD)ₓ. To form D₂, the reactants must supply deuterium. To form the deuteroxide, the reactants must supply the metal (M), oxygen (O), and deuterium (D).\n    *   The problem states that X incorporates a \"heavier isotope,\" which we've identified as deuterium (D). So, X must be a deuterated compound.\n    *   Let's propose a general reaction: A deuteride (from X) reacts with an oxygen source (Y). If the gas produced is D₂, a plausible reaction is the reaction of a deuteride with D₂O.\n    *   Let X be a metal deuteride and Y be D₂O. The reaction would be: `Metal Deuteride + D₂O → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`.\n    *   This reaction type is known for being violent, especially with reactive metal hydrides/deuterides.\n\n4.  **Use the Organic Chemistry Clues to Pinpoint X:**\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards a common reagent.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid has the general formula R-C(=O)-COOH, which contains 3 oxygen atoms. The reaction with X reduces the number of oxygen atoms to 2. This means X is a reducing agent.\n    *   Common hydride reducing agents in organic chemistry include sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄. LiAlH₄ is an \"especially\" common and powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n        *   **Analog:** LiAlH₄ is a very common reagent. This fits perfectly.\n        *   **Reaction with Y=D₂O:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n        *   **Violent?** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent.\n        *   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂ gas. This fits.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** The reaction produces LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (aluminium deuteroxide), which is a gelatinous precipitate analogous to Al(OH)₃. This fits.\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause decomposition: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases D₂O (Substance B). This fits.\n        *   **Reaction with keto acid:** LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group of a keto acid (R-C(=O)-COOH) to alcohols, forming a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). The starting keto acid has 3 oxygen atoms, and the final diol product has 2 oxygen atoms. This fits perfectly.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues point to Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄. The elements are Li, Al, and D (Deuterium, ²H).\n    *   We need the atomic masses (we can use integer mass numbers as the answers are integers):\n        *   Mass of Deuterium (D): 2\n        *   Mass of Lithium (Li): 7 (using the most common isotope, ⁷Li)\n        *   Mass of Aluminium (Al): 27 (only one stable isotope, ²⁷Al)\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (D), with a mass of 2.\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (Al), with a mass of 27.\n    *   The phrase \"cumulative atomic masses\" and the instruction \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" means we must sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in the formula.\n    *   Mass of all lightest element atoms (D): There are 4 D atoms in LiAlD₄. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of all heaviest element atoms (Al): There is 1 Al atom in LiAlD₄. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative sum = (Mass of all D atoms) + (Mass of all Al atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance B:**\n    *   The problem states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is the well-known melting point of heavy water, or deuterium oxide (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   The initial clue mentions that Substance X incorporates a \"heavier isotope,\" which strongly supports the presence of deuterium (D), the heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Gas W:**\n    *   The problem states that gas W is released in a reaction and its molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   Let's examine some simple gas molecules:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.

The molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. (Yes)\n    *   Given that we've already identified D₂O in the problem, the most logical candidate for gas W is **D₂**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n    *   **Clue 1:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope.\" This fits with a deuterated compound.\n    *   **Clue 2:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. A reduction reaction is required to lower the oxygen count to 2 (by converting both the ketone and carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). This means **X is a strong reducing agent**.\n    *   **Clue 3:** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common pair of reagents where one is the deuterated version of the other. The most famous strong reducing agent pairs are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Clue 4:** X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W (D₂) and form precipitate G. Let's test the hypothesis that **X is LiAlD₄**.\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent, fitting Clue 2.\n        *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent, fitting Clue 3.\n        *   It contains deuterium, fitting Clue 1.\n        *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with a deuterium source like heavy water (Y = D₂O) would be violent and produce D₂ gas. The reaction is:\n            LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)\n        *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W), which matches our deduction.\n        *   It also produces Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate, matching the description of G.\n    *   **Clue 5:** \"precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"\n        *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) causes decomposition:\n            2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O (B)\n        *   This reaction releases D₂O (B), which perfectly matches our first deduction.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The formula for Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   We identify the lightest and heaviest elements by their atomic number (Z):\n        *   Hydrogen (Z=1) -> **Lightest element**\n        *   Lithium (Z=3)\n        *   Aluminum (Z=13) -> **Heaviest element**\n    *   The question specifies to sum the masses of *all* instances of these elements in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved:\n        *   The isotope of the lightest element (Hydrogen) is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**.\n        *   The isotope of the heaviest element (Aluminum) is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**.\n    *   Now, we calculate the cumulative mass:\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (H): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Al): There is 1 atom of Aluminum. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from H) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a multi-step chemical puzzle. Let's break down the clues systematically to identify the unknown substances and arrive at the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The most specific clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   To convert Kelvin to Celsius, we use the formula: °C = K - 273.15.\n    *   277 K is approximately 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The problem states that gas W's molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Since we know Deuterium is involved, let's examine Deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A single Deuterium atom (symbol D or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A molecule of Deuterium gas (D₂) therefore contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   The number of protons equals the number of neutrons, so **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Identify X, Y, and G:**\n    *   The overall reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → Precipitate G + Gas W (D₂).\n    *   We are told the reaction is \"violent\".\n    *   We also know that precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is a characteristic decomposition of a metal deuteroxide, which breaks down into a metal oxide and heavy water. So, **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n    *   For the reaction to produce a metal deuteroxide (G) and deuterium gas (D₂), substance X must be a metal deuteride, and liquid Y must be D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is: X (Metal Deuteride) + Y (D₂O) → G (Metal Deuteroxide) + W (D₂).\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** We have two final, crucial clues about X:\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This strongly suggests a common hydride reducing agent. The most well-known are Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs, NaBD₄ and **LiAlD₄**, fit the description perfectly.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid contains two oxygen-bearing functional groups: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH). LiAlH₄ (and by extension, LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both of these groups to alcohols (-OH). The resulting product, a diol, would have exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms that X is a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄. (NaBD₄ is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids).\n\n    Therefore, we can confidently identify **Substance X as LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄). We will use the integer mass numbers for the relevant isotopes.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its most common isotope is 27.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (D):** There are four atoms of the isotope Deuterium. The mass number of Deuterium is 2. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** (Mass of Al) + (Total mass of D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Substance B**\n\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\nThis temperature is very close to the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\nThis, combined with the initial clue that Substance X contains a \"heavier isotope,\" strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n**2. Identify Precipitate G and the Reaction that Forms B**\n\nSubstance G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of the thermal decomposition of a metal hydroxide (or in this case, a metal deuteroxide). For example, a metal hydroxide decomposes into a metal oxide and water upon heating:\nM(OH)ₓ --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + H₂O\nTherefore, G must be a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes as follows:\nM(OD)ₓ --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + D₂O (Substance B)\n\n**3. Identify Gas W**\n\nGas W is released during the reaction of X and Y. The key property of W is that its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple gases:\n*   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. **(Protons = Neutrons)**. This is a strong candidate, especially since we've already identified D₂O in the reaction pathway.\n*   **¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas):** A ¹⁴N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. An N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. **(Protons = Neutrons)**. This is a possibility.\n*   **¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide):** A ¹²C atom has 6p, 6n. A ¹⁶O atom has 8p, 8n. A CO molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. **(Protons = Neutrons)**. This is also a possibility.\n*   **HD (Hydrogen deuteride):** 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p ≠ n).\n\nGiven that deuterium is clearly involved in the reaction (forming D₂O), D₂ is the most likely candidate for gas W.\n\n**4. Identify Substance X**\n\nWe have several clues about X:\n*   It contains a heavy isotope (Deuterium).\n*   It's a reagent used in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is especially common.\n*   It reacts with a liquid Y to produce a gas W (likely D₂), and a precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide).\n*   The product of its reaction with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. A reaction that reduces it to a product with 2 oxygens would be the reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to form a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which has 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a powerful reducing agent.\n\nA very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its analog containing a heavy isotope is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Let's see if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues.\n\n**5. Verify the Reaction Chemistry with X = LiAlD₄**\n\nLet's assume X is LiAlD₄. It is known to react violently with water. If liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction would be:\nLiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n\nLet's check the products against our deductions:\n*   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂ gas. As established, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (p=n). This fits.\n*   **Precipitate G:** The reaction produces Lithium Deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble in D₂O, and Aluminum Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Aluminum hydroxide is a well-known precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would be the precipitate G. This fits.\n*   **Heating G:** As determined earlier, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would produce an oxide and B (D₂O). This fits.\n*   **Organic Reagent:** LiAlH₄ is a staple in organic synthesis, and LiAlD₄ is its common deuterated analog. This fits.\n*   **Keto Acid Reaction:** LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is strong enough to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols, turning a keto acid into a diol, which has two oxygen atoms. This fits.\n\nAll clues point consistently to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The phrasing \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" indicates we need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Lightest Element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number):** Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   We will use integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes in the molecule: D (²H) has a mass of 2. The most common isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, with a mass of 27.\n\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D).\n    Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al).\n    Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K.\n2.  **Identify Substance G**: Precipitate G releases substance B (D₂O) upon heating. This indicates that G is a deuterated hydrate (a compound containing D₂O in its structure).\n3.  **Identify Gas W**: The gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. A simple molecule that fits this description is deuterium gas (D₂). Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n4.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G. The problem states that X contains a heavier isotope (which we know is deuterium, D) and that it and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of substance X perfectly. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water. For the reaction to produce deuterium gas (D₂), the other reactant must also be a source of deuterium. Therefore, liquid Y must be **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n5.  **Confirm the Reaction**: The reaction between Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (X) and heavy water (Y) is:\n    LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    This reaction produces deuterium gas (W) and aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a precipitate (G). Heating Al(OD)₃ yields aluminum oxide and heavy water (B). This confirms the identities of all substances.\n6.  **Confirm the Final Clue**: The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid into alcohol groups. The resulting product is a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. This final clue is consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n7.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass**: The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The molecule contains four atoms of the lightest element, in the form of Deuterium (²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu. The total mass from the lightest element is 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   The molecule contains one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminium. Aluminium's only stable isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass of approximately 27 amu. The total mass from the heaviest element is 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   The cumulative mass is the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided clues, the substances involved have been identified as follows:\n\n*   **Substance X**: Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). This is deduced from its nature as a powerful reducing agent (a close analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent in organic chemistry), its reaction to form the other identified products, and its role in the reduction of a keto acid. The reaction of a keto acid (containing a ketone and a carboxylic acid) with a strong reducing agent like LiAlH₄ (or its deuterated analog LiAlD₄) reduces both functional groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol which contains two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Liquid Y**: Heavy Water (D₂O). Its reaction with a deuteride source like LiAlD₄ is violent and produces the identified gas and precipitate.\n*   **Gas W**: Deuterium gas (D₂). A molecule of D₂ contains one proton and one neutron in each of its two atoms, for a total of two protons and two neutrons, fitting the description of having an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n*   **Precipitate G**: Aluminium Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). This is formed from the reaction of LiAlD₄ and D₂O.\n*   **Substance B**: Heavy Water (D₂O). When precipitate G, Al(OD)₃, is heated, it decomposes and releases heavy water.

This is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, analogous to the very common lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). It contains deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Liquid Y:** Heavy water (D₂O).\n*   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas (D₂). A molecule of D₂ contains one proton and one neutron in each atom, for a total of two protons and two neutrons, matching the description of having an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n*   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Lithium aluminum deuteride reacts violently with water (or heavy water) to produce a precipitate of aluminum hydroxide (or deuteroxide).\n*   **Substance B:** Heavy water (D₂O). The thermal decomposition of aluminum hydroxide yields alumina and water. Similarly, aluminum deuteroxide yields alumina and heavy water. The melting point of heavy water is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K. This is extremely close to the given 277 K. For comparison, normal water freezes at 273.15 K.\n\nThe reaction of a keto acid with LiAlD₄ (Substance X) would reduce the ketone group to an alcohol, resulting in a hydroxy acid which still contains two oxygen atoms, consistent with the clue.\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H) (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n2.  **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n3.  **Calculate the mass of the lightest element's atoms:** Substance X contains four atoms of the hydrogen isotope deuterium (²H).

Let's examine some simple gas molecules:\n    *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p≠n)\n    *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p≠n)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p=n). This is a strong candidate, as deuterium is a \"heavier isotope\".\n    *   CO (Carbon monoxide, with ¹²C and ¹⁶O): 6p+8p = 14 protons; 6n+8n = 14 neutrons. (p=n). This is a possibility.\n    *   N₂ (Nitrogen gas, with ¹⁴N): 7p+7p = 14 protons; 7n+7n = 14 neutrons. (p=n). This is a possibility.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance B:** A precipitate G is formed, which upon heating releases substance B. The melting point of B is ~277 K (3.85 °C). This is the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C). The melting point of normal water, H₂O, is 273.15 K (0 °C). This strongly indicates that B is D₂O.\n\n3.  **Connect the Clues:** Since D₂O (B) is released from G, and D₂ (W) is a likely gas product, it's highly probable that we are dealing with a system involving deuterium. For the reaction to produce D₂ gas (W) and form a product G that contains deuterium (since it releases D₂O), both substance X and liquid Y must be sources of deuterium.\n    *   Let's hypothesize a reaction. A common violent reaction that produces hydrogen gas is the reaction of a metal hydride with water.\n    *   Let's assume X is a deuteride (containing a heavy isotope of hydrogen, D) and Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   Let's test a powerful reducing agent, Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄), as Substance X. Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, is famous in organic chemistry.\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   Let's check if this fits the clues:\n        *   **Substance X (LiAlD₄):** Contains a heavier isotope (D). Check.\n        *   **Liquid Y (D₂O):** A liquid. Check.\n        *   **Reaction:** The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is notoriously violent. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O would be similarly violent. Check.\n        *   **Gas W (D₂):** As established, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (p=n). Check.\n        *   **Precipitate G (Al(OD)₃):** Aluminium hydroxide is a gelatinous precipitate. Al(OD)₃ would be as well. Check.\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating aluminium hydroxide causes dehydration. Similarly, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield aluminium oxide and heavy water: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B). Check.\n        *   **Melting point of B (D₂O):** ~277 K. Check.\n\n4.  **Confirm with the Final Clues:**\n    *   **Reaction with a keto acid:** A keto acid contains a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). LiAlH₄ (and therefore LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that reduces both functional groups to alcohols (-OH). The resulting molecule would be a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. This perfectly matches the clue.\n    *   **Reagent in organic chemistry:** LiAlH₄ is a staple reducing agent in organic synthesis. Its deuterated analog, LiAlD₄ (Substance X), is used for isotopic labeling in mechanistic studies.

Identifying Substance X:**\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope...\" and \"...used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"** This points towards a common reagent where isotopic labeling is used, such as a deuterated compound. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common reagent, and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits this description perfectly.\n*   **Clue 2: \"...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**\n    *   LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic solvents like water. Let's assume Liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`.\n    *   The gas released (W) is Deuterium gas (D₂). A Deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This matches the clue perfectly.\n*   **Clue 3: \"...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B...is very close to 277 K.\"**\n    *   277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K), which is very close to 277 K. So, B is D₂O.\n    *   From the reaction above, the products are Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD, soluble) and Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃, a precipitate). So, G is Al(OD)₃.\n    *   Heating G (Aluminum deuteroxide) causes decomposition: `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. This releases B (D₂O), confirming the identification.\n*   **Clue 4: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols (-OH).\n    *   The reaction product would be a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups).

Performing the Calculation:**\n\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n*   We need to find the lightest and heaviest elements present. Based on atomic mass, the lightest element is Hydrogen (as Deuterium) and the heaviest is Aluminum.\n*   The question asks for the *cumulative atomic masses* of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula. We'll use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n    *   **Lightest element (Deuterium, D or ²H):** Its mass number is 2. The formula LiAlD₄ contains 4 Deuterium atoms.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   **Heaviest element (Aluminum, Al):** Its most stable isotope is ²⁷Al.

A reaction that reduces the oxygen count to 2 implies a strong reduction. For example, the reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH2OH) results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This points towards a powerful reducing agent like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH4).\n    *   \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\" This suggests that X is an isotopically labeled version of a common reagent. Given the analog is likely LiAlH4, the heavier isotope is probably deuterium (D or ²H) replacing hydrogen (H). This makes **Substance X = LiAlD4** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n    *   \"Substance X... reacts violently with liquid Y... with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Hydrides like LiAlD4 react violently with protic solvents like water. Let's identify Y and W. The reaction produces hydrogen gas. If Y were regular water (H2O), the gas would be a mix including HD (2 protons, 1 neutron), which does not fit the description. If **liquid Y is heavy water (D2O)**, the reaction is LiAlD4 + 4 D2O → LiOD + Al(OD)3 + 4 D2. The gas released, **W = D2**, fits the description perfectly: a deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D2 molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   \"...a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B... is very close to 277 K.\" In the reaction above, the precipitate **G is Al(OD)3** (Aluminum deuteroxide). When heated, Al(OD)3 decomposes: 2 Al(OD)3 → Al2O3 + 3 D2O. The released substance **B is D2O**. The melting point of D2O is 276.97 K, which is very close to the stated 277 K.\n\n*   **Conclusion of Identification:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD4**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X.**\n\n*   Substance X is LiAlD4.\n*   The elements present in the molecule are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   Based on the periodic table (atomic number):\n    *   Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest element.\n    *   Aluminum (Z=13) is the heaviest element.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the cumulative atomic masses.**\n\n*   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within the molecule of X. This means summing the mass of all hydrogen atoms (isotopes) and all aluminum atoms.\n*   We will use the integer mass numbers for the relevant isotopes, which is standard for this type of problem.\n    *   The isotope of hydrogen present is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of 2.\n    *   The most common and stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule LiAlD4 contains four atoms of Deuterium.\n    *   Mass = 4 × (mass of one D atom) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule LiAlD4 contains one atom of Aluminum.\n    *   Mass = 1 × (mass of one Al atom) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   Total Mass = (Mass from Hydrogen isotopes) + (Mass from Aluminum)\n    *   Total Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The clue states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. Converting this to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C, but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an extremely close match, so we can confidently conclude that **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The problem mentions that substance X contains a \"heavier isotope\". Since we've identified D₂O, this isotope is very likely Deuterium (D, or ²H). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The gas W is said to have an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's test D₂ gas. A D₂ molecule has two deuterium atoms, so it contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. Thus, **W is D₂ (deuterium gas)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields D₂O. This suggests X is a powerful deuterated reducing agent.\n    *   The reaction of X with a keto acid produces a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (containing R-C(=O)-COOH) has at least 3 oxygen atoms. To reduce this to a product with 2 oxygens, both the ketone and the carboxylic acid must be reduced to alcohols, forming a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). The reduction of a carboxylic acid requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). The clue states that X has a \"very close analog\" used in organic chemistry. The deuterated version, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits this description.\n    *   Let's verify the reaction: LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic compounds like water (or in this case, likely D₂O) to produce D₂ gas and metal hydroxides (or deuteroxides): `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O → 4D₂ (W) + LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G)`. The precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide, which decomposes on heating to give aluminum oxide and heavy water (B): `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`.\n    *   All clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Mass:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements found in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is approximately **27 u**.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of Hydrogen, present as the isotope Deuterium (²H or D). The mass of one Deuterium atom is approximately **2 u**. The total mass from the four Deuterium atoms is 4 × 2 u = **8 u**.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum = (Total mass of Al) + (Total mass of D) = 27 + 8 = **35 u**.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses:\n\n**1. Identifying Substance X**\n\n*   **Heavier Isotope & Organic Chemistry Reagent:** The problem states that Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, along with its close analog. This points towards deuterated reducing agents, as deuterium (D or ²H) is a common heavy isotope used in organic synthesis. The most common of these reagents are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Reaction with Liquid Y:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce a gas W and a precipitate G.\n    *   **Gas W:** The key clue is that a molecule of gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n        *   Hydrogen gas (H₂): Each atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. A molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. (Incorrect)\n        *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Correct)\n    *   To produce D₂ gas, LiAlD₄ would need to react with a source of deuterium, meaning **Liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n\n*   **Precipitate G and Substance B:** The reaction produces lithium deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble, and aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), which is a precipitate. Therefore, **G is Al(OD)₃**. When aluminum hydroxide is heated, it decomposes to aluminum oxide and water. Similarly, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would produce aluminum oxide and heavy water (D₂O). Thus, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Melting Point of B:** The melting point of B is close to 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K. This is extremely close to the given value.\n\n*   **Reaction with a Keto Acid:** The problem states the product of the reaction between a keto acid and substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (and by extension LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. For instance, the reduction of an α-keto acid like pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH, which has 3 oxygen atoms) with LiAlH₄ yields 1,2-propanediol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH, which has 2 oxygen atoms). This matches the description.\n\nBased on this evidence, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n*   **Lightest Element:** The element with the lowest atomic number is Hydrogen (Z=1). In Substance X, it is present as its heavier isotope, Deuterium.\n*   **Heaviest Element:** The element with the highest atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The mass of the single heaviest element atom, Aluminum (²⁷Al), is approximately 27 amu.\n    *   The mass of the lightest element's isotopes must be summed. There are four atoms of Deuterium (²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu\n    *   Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35 amu\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical riddle to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. The melting point of water (H₂O) at normal pressure is 273.15 K (0 °C), while the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This strongly suggests that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W released has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's examine potential candidates:\n    *   Hydrogen deuteride (HD): 2 protons, 1 neutron.\n    *   Deuterium gas (D₂): A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    This perfectly matches the description, so **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope, which we've identified as deuterium (D). It is a reagent used in organic chemistry, with a very close analog. This points to common deuterated reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Their analogs are LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄. For substance X to react and release deuterium gas (D₂), it must react with a deuterium source. The violent reaction described points to **Liquid Y being heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction would be:\n    `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n\n4.  **Identify Precipitate G:** The reaction produces a precipitate G, which upon heating, releases B (D₂O). In the reaction above, the products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Aluminum hydroxide is known to be a precipitate. When heated, aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) decomposes to aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) and water (H₂O). By analogy, aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, would be the precipitate **G**, which decomposes upon heating to release heavy water, **D₂O (B)**.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Identity of Substance X:** The riddle states that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄)** is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid (R-CO-COOH) to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains two oxygen atoms. Therefore, LiAlD₄ would behave similarly.\n    *   **Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄)** is a milder reducing agent and typically reduces ketones but not carboxylic acids. The product would be a hydroxy acid (R-CH(OH)-COOH), which contains three oxygen atoms.\n    Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The final step is to calculate the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen. There are 4 atoms of its heavier isotope, Deuterium. The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu.\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum. There is 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass of an aluminum atom is approximately 27 amu.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element's atoms:** 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element's atoms:** 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** 8 + 27 = 35 amu.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical riddle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The clue states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 3.85°C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where D is the deuterium isotope of hydrogen, is 3.82°C (276.97 K).\n    *   This strongly indicates that **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Heavier Isotope and Substance X:**\n    *   Since B is D₂O, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the first clue is **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   Substance X incorporates this isotope and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, along with its \"very close analog\". This points to common deuterated reagents. The most common are lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) and sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Their non-deuterated analogs, LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄, are staple reducing agents in organic chemistry.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The riddle describes the reaction: Substance X + Liquid Y → Gas W + Precipitate G.\n    *   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W contains the same number of neutrons and protons. If we assume the gas is related to the deuterium isotope, Deuterium gas (D₂) fits this description perfectly. A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Reaction Confirmation:** For D₂ gas to be released, Substance X (the deuteride) must react with a source of deuterium. The most likely candidate for liquid Y is therefore heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   Let's test our candidates for X against this:\n        *   **If X is LiAlD₄:** LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂. This reaction produces D₂ gas.\n        *   **If X is NaBD₄:** NaBD₄ + 4 D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4 D₂. This reaction also produces D₂ gas.\n\n4.  **Use the Precipitate Clue to Distinguish X:** A precipitate G is formed.\n    *   In the LiAlD₄ reaction, the products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). LiOD is soluble, but aluminum hydroxide (and by extension, Al(OD)₃) is famously insoluble in water and forms a gelatinous precipitate.\n    *   In the NaBD₄ reaction, the products are sodium deuteroxide (NaOD) and boric acid-d₃ (B(OD)₃). Both NaOD and boric acid are soluble in water.\n    *   The formation of a precipitate strongly indicates that **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)** and the precipitate G is Al(OD)₃.\n\n5.  **Final Clue Confirmation:**\n    *   **Heating G releases B:** Heating aluminum hydroxide (or deuteroxide) causes it to decompose, releasing water (or heavy water): 2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O. This is consistent with G releasing B (D₂O).\n    *   **Reaction with keto acid:** Lithium aluminum hydride is a powerful reducing agent that reduces keto acids to diols. A keto acid contains a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group (3 oxygen atoms). The reduction product, a diol, contains two alcohol functional groups (2 oxygen atoms). This matches the clue that the product contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Violent Reaction:** LiAlH₄ is known to react violently with water. Its deuterated analog would behave similarly with heavy water. NaBH₄ reacts much more slowly with water, especially in neutral or basic conditions. The term \"violently\" further supports LiAlD₄ as Substance X.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (atomic mass ≈ 2 amu).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic mass ≈ 27 amu).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing all instances.\n    *   Mass of all lightest elements (4 Deuterium atoms): 4 × 2 amu = 8 amu.\n    *   Mass of all heaviest elements (1 Aluminum atom): 1 × 27 amu = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative sum: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Decipher the clues to identify Substance X, Y, W, G, and B.**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons.**\n    Let's examine potential simple gases formed in chemical reactions. We'll use the most common isotopes (e.g., ¹H, ¹²C, ¹⁴N, ¹⁶O, ¹⁹F).\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n    *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂):** 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n    *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Yes)\n    *   CO: 6p+8p=14 protons, 6n+8n=14 neutrons. (Yes)\n    *   HF: 1p+9p=10 protons, 0n+10n=10 neutrons. (Yes)\n    The first clue, \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope\", strongly points towards Deuterium (D). Therefore, **Gas W is most likely D₂.**\n\n*   **Clue 2: The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.**\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match.\n    Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O (heavy water).**\n\n*   **Clue 3: Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).**\n    This is a classic dehydration reaction. G is likely a metal hydroxide which, upon heating, decomposes into a metal oxide and water. Since the product is D₂O, G must be a deuterated metal hydroxide (a metal deuteroxide), M(OD)ₙ.\n    Reaction: M(OD)ₙ --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + D₂O (B).\n\n*   **Clue 4: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W (D₂) and form precipitate G (M(OD)ₙ).**\n    Since the products contain deuterium (D₂ and M(OD)ₙ), the reactants must provide the deuterium atoms. X is known to contain a heavy isotope (D), so the reaction must be X + Y -> D₂ + G. To produce D₂ gas and a deuteroxide precipitate, the liquid Y is almost certainly the deuterium source, **D₂O (heavy water)**, which is consistent with it being released from G upon heating.\n    So the reaction is: X + D₂O -> D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate).\n\n*   **Clue 5: Identifying Substance X.**\n    X reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas. This is characteristic of a powerful reducing agent, like a metal hydride or a complex metal hydride. The clue \"substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common lab reagents. Let's test the most common ones: Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). The deuterated versions would be NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n\n    *   If X = NaBD₄: The reaction with D₂O would be NaBD₄ + 4D₂O -> NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂. The products are sodium deuteroxide (soluble) and boric acid-d3 (soluble). No precipitate G would form. So, NaBD₄ is incorrect.\n    *   If X = LiAlD₄: The reaction with D₂O would be LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is a gelatinous precipitate, analogous to Al(OH)₃. This fits the description of precipitate G.\n\n*   **Clue 6: The keto acid reaction.**\n    This is the final confirmation. \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    A keto acid has a ketone (C=O) group and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n    Substance X is LiAlD₄, a very strong reducing agent. Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   Ketone (R-C(=O)-R') -> Secondary alcohol (R-CH(OH)-R')\n    *   Carboxylic acid (R-COOH) -> Primary alcohol (R-CH₂OH)\n    Applying this to a keto acid (R-C(=O)-COOH) with our substance X (LiAlD₄), both groups will be reduced:\n    R-C(=O)-COOH --(1. LiAlD₄ / 2. H₂O workup)--> R-CD(OH)-CD₂OH\n    The final product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups). Let's count the oxygen atoms: R-CD(**O**H)-CD₂**O**H. There are indeed **2 oxygen atoms**. This confirms our identification.\n\n    Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, LiAlD₄.**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the cumulative atomic masses.**\n\nThe question asks for \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The clause \"considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" clarifies that we must sum the masses of all atoms of the relevant elements.\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H). The isotope of hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n2.  **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   By atomic number: H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13). The lightest is Hydrogen, and the heaviest is Aluminum.\n3.  **Sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements.** We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved:\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (²H), mass number = 2.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, mass number = 27.\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Al. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of D. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative sum = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from H) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is my thinking process to solve this chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the problem into individual clues and analyze them one by one.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"** This immediately suggests we are dealing with isotopes, most commonly Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen) or possibly isotopes like ¹³C or ¹⁵N. Deuterium is a very common tracer and is used to make special reagents.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: \"...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"** This is a very specific and helpful clue. Let's analyze potential gases (W):\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   He (Helium): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Yes. But Helium is inert and unlikely to be produced in a violent chemical reaction.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Yes. This is a very strong candidate, especially given Clue 1.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Possible.\n        *   Let's consider molecules. D₂O (as steam): 10 protons (8 from O, 2 from D), 10 neutrons (8 from ¹⁶O, 2 from D). Yes.\n        *   Given the violent reaction, the production of a simple gas like D₂ from a deuterated reagent is chemically very plausible. Let's tentatively assume **W = D₂**.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: \"a precipitate G forms...\"** The reaction produces a solid that is insoluble in the reaction medium.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: \"...which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        *   Let's convert the temperature: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). This is close, but maybe not \"very close\".\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is *extremely* close to 277 K.\n        *   This strongly suggests that **B = D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"** This points towards common laboratory reagents.\n\n    *   **Clue 6: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"** A keto acid is a molecule with both a ketone functional group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This means the starting material has at least 3 oxygen atoms. The reaction with X causes a loss of one oxygen atom, which is characteristic of a reduction reaction (specifically, the reduction of the carboxylic acid to an alcohol).\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues:** Now I will piece together the deductions.\n\n    *   If B is D₂O, it must be released from heating the precipitate G. This means G contains deuterium and oxygen. A common reaction is the thermal decomposition of a metal hydroxide, like 2M(OH)₃ → M₂O₃ + 3H₂O. So, G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)ₓ.\n    *   The initial reaction is: X + Y → D₂ (gas W) + M(OD)ₓ (precipitate G).\n    *   For the products to be D₂ and M(OD)ₓ, the reactants must have contained M and D. Since the reaction is violent, it is likely a reaction of a very reactive deuteride (Substance X) with a source of deuterium oxide (Liquid Y).\n    *   Therefore, **Liquid Y must be heavy water, D₂O.**\n    *   The reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂ + M(OD)ₓ.\n    *   What could X be? It must be a powerful reducing agent to reduce D⁺ from D₂O to D₂ gas. It must also contain a metal (M) that forms an insoluble hydroxide/deuteroxide. Aluminum (Al) is a perfect candidate, as Al(OH)₃ is a well-known gelatinous precipitate.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that **X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, LiAlD₄**. Its \"very close analog\" is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), one of the most common and powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry (fitting Clue 5).\n    *   Let's check the reaction: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4D₂ (gas W). This fits perfectly.\n    *   Let's check the final clue (Clue 6). A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) reacts with LiAlD₄. LiAlD₄ is strong enough to reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols: R-CO-COOH + LiAlD₄ → R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH). The starting material has 3 oxygens, and the final product (a diol) has 2 oxygens. This also fits perfectly.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   My deduction is solid: **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". We should use integer mass numbers for the most common/relevant isotopes.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its heavier isotope, Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number Z=1).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number Z=13).\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen/Deuterium): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium (¹H²) is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its only stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum the two values.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning used to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Convert the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which contains a heavier isotope of hydrogen, is 3.82 °C.\n    *   The value 3.85 °C is a very close match to the melting point of D₂O. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Heavier Isotope and Gas W:**\n    *   Since B is identified as D₂O, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned must be **Deuterium (D)**. Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen with one proton and one neutron (mass number ≈ 2).\n    *   This means Substance X must contain Deuterium.\n    *   The reaction releases gas W, whose molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's consider Deuterium gas, D₂. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Function of Substance X:**\n    *   A keto acid (general formula R-C(=O)-COOH) contains one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group, for a total of **3 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The product of its reaction with X has only **2 oxygen atoms**. This indicates a reduction has occurred, for example, the reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid to alcohols, resulting in a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH) which has 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   This type of transformation requires a powerful reducing agent. Thus, **Substance X is a strong reducing agent**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We are looking for a common, strong reducing agent from organic chemistry that contains deuterium. The clue about its \"very close analog\" points to deuterated versions of common reagents. The most powerful common reducing agents are Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   Their deuterated analogs are **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)** and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n    *   Let's test these candidates against the reaction `X + Y(liquid) → D₂(gas) + G(precipitate)`. To produce D₂ gas, the liquid Y must be a deuterium source, such as D₂O.\n    *   Let's examine the reaction with X = LiAlD₄ and Y = D₂O:\n        `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`\n    *   This reaction fits all the given clues:\n        *   It is known to be **violent**.\n        *   It produces **D₂ gas (W)**.\n        *   It forms a **precipitate (G)**, Aluminium Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), which is the analog of the insoluble Aluminium Hydroxide.\n        *   When heated, the precipitate G decomposes to release substance B: `2 Al(OD)₃(s) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3 D₂O(g)`. This releases **D₂O (B)**.\n    *   The alternative, NaBD₄, would produce soluble products, not a precipitate. Therefore, we can confidently identify **Substance X as Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄), using integer mass numbers for the isotopes.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminium.\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements present in the molecule.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (²H), each with a mass number of 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is 1 atom of Aluminium (²⁷Al), with a mass number of 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative sum is 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This suggests the presence of isotopes like Deuterium (D), ¹³C, ¹⁵N, ¹⁸O, etc., instead of their lighter, more common counterparts.\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance X and its analog are used in organic chemistry.** This points towards a common reagent. Powerful reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are prime suspects. The deuterated versions (LiAlD₄, NaBD₄) are used for isotopic labeling.\n    *   **Clue 3: Reaction of X with a keto acid.** A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. The product having only 2 oxygen atoms implies a reduction reaction where both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups are reduced to alcohols. LiAlH₄ (and its analog LiAlD₄) is strong enough to perform this double reduction, yielding a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)), which has 2 oxygen atoms. This strongly supports X being LiAlD₄.\n    *   **Clue 4: Melting point of B is ~277 K.** 277 Kelvin is approximately 3.85°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K), but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is a very strong match. Thus, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 5: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and precipitate G. G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).**\n        *   Since G releases D₂O upon heating, G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, analogous to a metal hydroxide that releases H₂O upon heating (e.g., 2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O). So, G is likely Al(OD)₃.\n        *   This implies the reaction involves Aluminium and Deuterium. This further strengthens the case for X = LiAlD₄.\n        *   The violent reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is well-known. A similar violent reaction would occur between LiAlD₄ and a deuterated water source. Let's assume liquid **Y is D₂O**.\n        *   Let's write the reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n    *   **Clue 6: Gas W's molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons.** Let's check our proposed gas W, which is D₂.\n        *   Deuterium (D) is an isotope of Hydrogen (¹H) with 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n        *   A D₂ molecule contains (1+1) = 2 protons and (1+1) = 2 neutrons.\n        *   The number of protons and neutrons are equal. This perfectly matches the clue.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    All clues converge to identify Substance X as **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Atomic Number Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D, Z=1).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminium (Z=13).\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these elements in the molecule.\n    *   We use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved:\n        *   Deuterium (D or ²H) has a mass number of 2.\n        *   The most common and stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element's atoms:** There are four atoms of Deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element's atoms:** There is one atom of Aluminium (Al) in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative (summed) mass:**\n        *   Sum = (Total mass of D atoms) + (Total mass of Al atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Check:**\n    The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical riddle and arrive at the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O). The \"normal conditions\" melting point of regular water is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X and the Heavier Isotope:** Since a product of a subsequent reaction is heavy water (D₂O), the heavier isotope mentioned in the first clue must be deuterium (D or ²H). This implies that Substance X contains deuterium. The clue that \"X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points strongly to Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), a powerful and common reducing agent. Its \"very close analog\" containing the heavier isotope is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**. This is our Substance X. It is a powerful reducing agent known for its violent reactions, especially with water.\n\n3.  **Identify Liquid Y and Gas W:** Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce a gas W and a precipitate G. The most logical violent reaction for a metal hydride is with water. Given the context of deuterium, liquid Y is likely heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂ (deuterium gas). Let's check if it fits the description: \"a gas whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This matches the clue perfectly. Other common molecules like N₂, O₂, and CO₂ also have this property, but D₂ is the most logical product in this specific reaction.\n\n4.  **Identify Precipitate G:** In the reaction above, Lithium Deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but Aluminum Deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, would form a precipitate, analogous to Aluminum Hydroxide, Al(OH)₃. So, G is Al(OD)₃.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Decomposition of G:** The clue states that when precipitate G is heated, it releases B.\n    *   **Reaction:** Heating Aluminum Hydroxide causes it to decompose into aluminum oxide and water: 2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O.\n    *   Therefore, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n    *   This reaction releases **D₂O**, which we've identified as substance B. This confirms the entire reaction sequence.\n\n6.  **Verify the Final Clue:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent.\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). An example is pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH), which has three oxygen atoms.\n    *   LiAlH₄ (and by extension LiAlD₄) reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   The ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-), and the carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   So, pyruvic acid would be reduced to 1,2-propanediol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH). This resulting molecule contains exactly two oxygen atoms, satisfying the clue.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄), summing all instances.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D, atomic number 1).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The formula LiAlD₄ contains one atom of the heaviest element (Al) and four atoms of the lightest element (D).\n    *   We need the atomic mass of the specific isotopes: ²⁷Al and ²H (Deuterium).\n    *   Atomic mass of ²⁷Al ≈ 26.9815 u.\n    *   Atomic mass of ²H (Deuterium) ≈ 2.0141 u.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 × 26.9815 u = 26.9815 u\n        *   Total mass of the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 × 2.0141 u = 8.0564 u\n        *   Cumulative mass = 26.9815 + 8.0564 = 35.0379 u\n\n8.  **Final Answer:** The calculated cumulative atomic mass is approximately 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe user's query is a chemical puzzle that requires identifying a substance (X) and then performing a calculation based on its constituent elements. I have deduced the identity of substance X and confirmed all the related chemical reactions and properties through search queries. My initial hypothesis seems correct.\n\n**Here is a summary of the findings:**\n\n*   **Substance X:** The clues strongly point to Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope: Deuterium (D), an isotope of Hydrogen.\n    *   Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry, known for its violent reactions, especially with protic substances. LiAlD₄ shares these properties.\n*   **Melting Point of B:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C), which matches the clue precisely. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n*   **Reaction of X with Y:**\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W and form precipitate G.\n    *   If Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. This reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   **Gas W** is D₂ (dideuterium). A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the clue that the number of protons and neutrons is the same.\n    *   **Precipitate G** is Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃.\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) causes decomposition to Al₂O₃ and D₂O (substance B), which aligns with the clues.\n*   **Reaction with Keto Acid:** LiAlH₄ (and by extension LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. A keto acid contains both functional groups. For example, reducing pyruvic acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) would yield propane-1,2-diol, a product with 2 oxygen atoms, which matches the clue.\n*   **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in the substance.\n    *   The mass of the lightest element's instances in the molecule: There are four atoms of Deuterium (²H or D). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu. The total mass is 4 * 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   The mass of the heaviest element's instances in the molecule: There is one atom of Aluminium. The only stable isotope of Aluminium is Aluminium-27 (²⁷Al), which has an atomic mass of approximately 27 amu. The total mass is 1 * 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe logic holds, and the calculation is straightforward based on the identified substance. All clues are satisfied.\n\nFinal answer is 35, which corresponds to option D.\nI am ready to provide the final answer.\nBased on the detailed chemical puzzle provided, the substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). Here is a step-by-step deduction:\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The melting point of substance B is stated to be very close to 277 K (4°C). This is the characteristic melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K. This implies that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Identification of Substance X**: The problem states that substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Since X contains deuterium, its analog contains hydrogen. Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very powerful and common reducing agent, and its deuterated version, Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄), is also used for isotopic labeling. This makes LiAlD₄ a strong candidate for substance X.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Reaction**:\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y. Let's assume Y is heavy water (D₂O). The reaction is `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   A gas, W, is released whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. The gas produced is D₂. A deuterium nucleus has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description perfectly.\n    *   A precipitate, G, is formed. In the reaction, Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, would precipitate.\n    *   When G is heated, it releases B (D₂O). Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause it to decompose into Al₂O₃ and D₂O, which is consistent with the clues.\n\n4.  **Reaction with a Keto Acid**: LiAlH₄ (and therefore LiAlD₄) reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid into alcohol groups. For instance, pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH), which has three oxygen atoms, would be reduced to propane-1,2-diol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂(OH)), a product containing two oxygen atoms. This matches the problem's description.\n\n5.  **Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Masses**:\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (lightest metal), Aluminium (heaviest element), and Deuterium (isotope of the lightest element, Hydrogen).\n    *   The **lightest element** present is Hydrogen (represented by its isotope, Deuterium).\n    *   The **heaviest element** present is Aluminium.\n    *   The cumulative mass from the atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen) in the molecule is the sum of the masses of the four Deuterium atoms. The mass of one Deuterium (²H) atom is approximately 2 atomic mass units (amu).\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 amu = 8 amu.\n    *   The cumulative mass from the atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminium) in the molecule is the mass of the one Aluminium atom. The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass of approximately 27 amu.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 amu = 27 amu.\n    *   The cumulative atomic mass is the sum of these values: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (~4 °C). The normal melting point of water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C), but heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), has a melting point of 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This strongly suggests that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X and its Reactions:**\n    *   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope. The identity of B as D₂O implies this isotope is deuterium.\n    *   A close analog of X is a common reagent in organic chemistry. This points to reagents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). The deuterated analog would be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n    *   X reacts violently with a liquid Y to release a gas W and form a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is known to be violent. Let's assume **X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Heating precipitate G releases B (D₂O). The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (Y = D₂O) would be:\n        `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n        This reaction is violent.\n    *   The precipitate **G** would be a mix of Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Heating aluminum hydroxide (or deuteroxide) causes it to decompose and release water (or heavy water). `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This matches the observation that heating G releases B.\n    *   The gas **W** released is deuterium gas (D₂). A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description that it \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   The final clue is that the product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to hydroxyl groups (-OH), resulting in a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n    *   The instruction specifies summing the masses of all instances of these elements in the molecule.\n\n    *   **Mass of the Lightest Element (Hydrogen):**\n        There are four atoms of the deuterium isotope (D) in the molecule.\n        The mass number of a single deuterium atom is 2 (1 proton + 1 neutron). Its atomic mass is approximately 2.014 amu.\n        Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n\n    *   **Mass of the Heaviest Element (Aluminum):**\n        There is one atom of Aluminum (Al) in the molecule.\n        The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27. Its atomic mass is approximately 26.98 amu.\n        Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:**\n        Sum = (Total mass of lightest element) + (Total mass of heaviest element)\n        Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances and Reactions:**\n    *   **Clue 6:** \"The melting point of B ... is very close to 277 K.\" 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is an extremely strong hint that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 5:** \"...a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\" This means that heating the precipitate G produces D₂O. This is characteristic of heating a deuterated metal hydroxide (e.g., M(OD)n → MOx + D₂O) or a salt containing heavy water of crystallization (Salt·xD₂O → Salt + xD₂O). For this to happen, D₂O must be involved in the initial reaction.\n    *   **Connecting Clues:** Since D₂O is a key component, it's highly probable that **liquid Y is D₂O**. The problem states that substance X reacts violently with liquid Y.\n    *   **Clues 7 & 8:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" These clues point towards a reducing agent used in organic synthesis. Keto acids (R-CO-COOH) have two reducible groups: a ketone and a carboxylic acid. Strong reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) can reduce both, yielding a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ is a staple reagent, fitting the description. The mention of a \"heavier isotope\" (Clue 1) leads us to its deuterated analog: **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Confirming with all clues:** Let's test the hypothesis that **X = LiAlD₄** and **Y = D₂O**.\n        *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑\n        *   **Clue 1 (Heavy Isotope):** X (LiAlD₄) contains Deuterium (D). ✓\n        *   **Clue 2 (Violent Reaction):** The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is notoriously violent; the reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O would be similarly violent. ✓\n        *   **Clue 3 (Gas W):** The gas released is D₂ (Deuterium gas). A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. The number of neutrons and protons is the same. ✓\n        *   **Clue 4 (Precipitate G):** Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is formed, which is insoluble and precipitates from the solution. ✓\n        *   **Clue 5 & 6 (G and B):** When precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. The released substance B is D₂O, whose melting point is indeed ~277 K. ✓\n    *   All clues are consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest and heaviest elements** present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula unit. We should use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved (D = ²H, and Al is naturally ~100% ²⁷Al).\n    *   Mass of Deuterium (D) ≈ 2 amu.\n    *   Mass of Aluminum (Al) ≈ 27 amu.\n    *   There are **four** Deuterium atoms in LiAlD₄. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   There is **one** Aluminum atom in LiAlD₄. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Total mass of D atoms) + (Total mass of Al atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35 amu.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify substance X and calculate the required atomic masses:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the characteristic melting point of heavy water (D₂O).\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W, released during the reaction, has an equal number of neutrons and protons. A common gas produced in reactions with deuterated compounds is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description.\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** The information points towards a deuterated reducing agent commonly used in organic chemistry. The close analog being a very common reagent suggests either sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) or lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Consequently, substance X is likely sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄) or lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). The reduction of a keto acid to a product containing two oxygen atoms is consistent with the action of these reagents.\n4.  **Confirming Substance X:** The reaction of X with a liquid Y is violent and produces a precipitate G, which upon heating releases heavy water (B). If we consider X to be LiAlD₄ and Y to be an acid like DCl, the reaction would be LiAlD₄ + 4DCl → LiCl + AlCl₃ + 4D₂. The gas produced is D₂ (W). Aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) can form a hydrate, or in this context, a \"deuterate\" like [Al(D₂O)₆]Cl₃, which would be the precipitate G. Heating this deuterate would release heavy water, D₂O (B). This sequence of reactions aligns perfectly with all the clues. LiAlD₄ is a more potent reducing agent than NaBD₄ and is known for its violent reactions.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nBased on the analysis, substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n*   The lightest element is Hydrogen, present as its heavier isotope, Deuterium (D).\n*   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al).\n*   The chemical formula is LiAlD₄. There are four atoms of the lightest element (D) and one atom of the heaviest element (Al).\n\nNow, we calculate the cumulative atomic masses:\n\n*   The atomic mass of one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminum (Al), is approximately 27 amu.\n*   The atomic mass of one atom of the lightest element's heavy isotope, Deuterium (D), is approximately 2 amu.\n*   The sum of the masses of all the heavier isotopes (one Aluminum atom) is 1 x 27 = 27 amu.\n*   The sum of the masses of all the lighter isotopes (four Deuterium atoms) is 4 x 2 = 8 amu.\n*   The cumulative atomic mass is the sum of these two values: 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is ~277 K (4°C). This is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82°C (276.97 K). The heavier isotope mentioned in the prompt is likely Deuterium (D), the isotope of Hydrogen. So, B is D₂O.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance G:** G is a precipitate that releases B (D₂O) upon heating. This suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide, likely Al(OD)₃, which upon heating decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance Y and Gas W:** The reaction of X and Y produces a precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) and a gas W. The reaction is violent, typical of a strong reducing agent with a protic solvent. For the product to be Al(OD)₃, the reactants must contain Al and D. Y is the source of the OD group, so Y is likely D₂O (liquid heavy water).\n    The reaction would be: X + D₂O → Al(OD)₃ + ...\n    Gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's test D₂ gas (Deuterium gas). Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** Based on the above, X is a powerful reducing agent containing Aluminum and Deuterium. The reaction with a keto acid producing a product with 2 oxygens (reduction of both keto and carboxylic acid groups) points strongly to a reagent like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Since the substance contains Deuterium, it must be the deuterated analog: Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   Let's check the reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W). This reaction is consistent with all the clues.\n    *   The \"close analog\" used in organic chemistry is LiAlH₄.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Value:**\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   The atomic mass numbers for the relevant isotopes are: D ≈ 2, Li ≈ 7, Al ≈ 27.\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (D).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The problem asks for the sum of the masses of *all instances* of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   In LiAlD₄, there are four atoms of the lightest element (D). Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   There is one atom of the heaviest element (Al). Total mass = 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative mass = (mass of all D atoms) + (mass of all Al atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.

Powerful reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) fit this description. Their \"close analogs\" incorporating a heavier isotope would be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n*   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\": A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Both functional groups are reduced by strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄. The ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The resulting molecule is a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. This strongly supports X being a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄. NaBH₄ is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction of X with Y.**\n*   \"X... reacts violently with liquid Y\": LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water and other protic solvents. This supports the identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n*   \"with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\": Let's analyze potential small gas molecules (W) where the number of protons (p⁺) equals the number of neutrons (n⁰). We use the most common isotopes unless specified.\n    *   H₂: 2 p⁺, 0 n⁰\n    *   He: 2 p⁺, 2 n⁰ (Inert, unlikely product of a violent reaction)\n    *   **D₂ (²H₂)**: 2 p⁺, 2 n⁰. This fits perfectly and is consistent with X containing Deuterium.\n    *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 p⁺, 14 n⁰. Plausible, but less connected to the other clues.\n    *   ¹²C¹⁶O: 14 p⁺, 14 n⁰. Plausible, but less connected.\n    *   CD₄: 10 p⁺, 10 n⁰. Plausible, but formation from a keto acid reaction isn't direct.\n    Given that X contains deuterium, the most likely gas W is D₂. For LiAlD₄ to produce D₂ gas, it must react with a source of deuterium. The most common liquid that is a source of deuterium is heavy water, D₂O.\n*   So, we can deduce: **X = LiAlD₄** and **Y = D₂O**.\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is violent, releases D₂ gas (W), and involves the deuterated reagent X.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the precipitate G and substance B.**\n*   \"a precipitate G forms\": In the reaction above, Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is insoluble and will form a precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n*   \"which, when heated, releases B\": Hydroxides and deuteroxides decompose upon heating to form an oxide and water.\n    *   Decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n    *   The substance released (B) is heavy water, D₂O. So, **B = D₂O**.\n*   \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\": The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). 276.97 K is indeed very close to 277 K. This confirms all our deductions.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   Substance X has been identified as **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   The lightest element (by atomic number) is Hydrogen. The isotope present is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n*   The heaviest element (by atomic number) is Aluminum (Al). The stable isotope is ²⁷Al.\n*   The calculation requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements found in the formula unit.\n    *   **Mass of Hydrogen isotopes**: There are four atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass of one D atom is approximately 2 amu.\n      Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass of Aluminum isotopes**: There is one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass of one ²⁷Al atom is 27 amu.\n      Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative (total) sum**:\n    Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum)\n    Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n**Detailed Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B:** The melting point of Substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". This is 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), containing the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is an excellent match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identification of the Heavier Isotope:** The presence of D₂O confirms that the heavier isotope mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n3.  **Identification of Gas W:** The gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze D₂, a gas that would logically be formed in a system containing Deuterium. A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has (1+1) = 2 protons and (1+1) = 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. **W is D₂ gas**.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the Reaction:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases D₂O (Substance B).\n    *   This is a classic reaction of a highly reactive metal deuteride with heavy water. The general form is: `Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuterated Hydroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`.\n    *   The precipitate G is a deuterated hydroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which upon heating decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O. `2M(OD)ₓ → M₂Oₓ + x D₂O`.\n    *   This confirms that **Y is D₂O**.\n\n5.  **Identification of Substance X:**\n    *   Clue: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards common hydride/deuteride reducing agents. The most prominent are sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Substance X is likely the deuterated version of one of these, i.e., NaBD₄ or LiAlD₄.\n    *   Clue: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., an α-keto acid R-CO-COOH) contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group, and has 3 oxygen atoms. A powerful reducing agent like LiAlH₄ (or its analog, X = LiAlD₄) can reduce both functional groups: the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid becomes a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The final product, a diol like R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH), contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. A milder reagent like NaBH₄ would not reduce the carboxylic acid.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminum.\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄. We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's atoms: There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of D is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element's atoms: There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the most common isotope is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nBased on the detailed chemical puzzle, the cumulative atomic mass is calculated to be 35.\n\n**Here is the step-by-step derivation:**\n\n*   **Substance B:** The melting point is very close to 277 K (which is 3.85 °C). This corresponds to the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n*   **Liquid Y:** Since the reaction with X produces deuterated compounds, Y is also **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Deuterium gas (**D₂**) fits this description perfectly. A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   **Substance X:** This substance reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. Its \"very close analog\" is a common reagent in organic chemistry. Furthermore, it reduces a keto acid to a product with two oxygen atoms. These clues strongly point to **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Violent Reaction:** LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water, including heavy water.\n    *   **Organic Reagent Analog:** Its analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a very powerful and common reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n    *   **Keto Acid Reaction:** LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is strong enough to reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH). This transforms the acid, which has three oxygen atoms, into a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which has only two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Precipitate G:** The reaction of LiAlD₄ with excess D₂O produces soluble lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and a precipitate, **aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**.\n*   **Heating G:** When aluminum deuteroxide (or hydroxide) is heated, it decomposes and releases heavy water (D₂O), which is substance B.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nThe problem asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n1.  **Elements in X:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n2.  **Lightest Element:** The element with the lowest atomic number is Hydrogen, present as its isotope Deuterium (D). There are **four** Deuterium atoms.\n3.  **Heaviest Element:** The element with the highest atomic number is Aluminum (Al). There is **one** Aluminum atom.\n4.  **Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The mass of an Aluminum (²⁷Al) atom is approximately **27** amu.\n    *   The mass of a Deuterium (²H) atom is approximately **2** amu.\n5.  **Cumulative Mass Calculation:**\n    *   Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   Total mass of the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   Cumulative sum = 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThe provided information confirms the deductions made during the thinking process.\n\n*   **Substance X and its reactions:** Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) is a potent reducing agent used for deuterium labeling. It is the deuterated analog of the very common reagent lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water, and by extension, LiAlD₄ would react violently with heavy water (D₂O). The reaction of LiAlH₄ with H₂O produces LiOH, Al(OH)₃, and H₂ gas. By analogy, reacting LiAlD₄ with D₂O would produce LiOD, Al(OD)₃, and D₂ gas. Gas W, D₂, has one proton and one neutron per atom, meaning the molecule D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description of having an equal number.\n*   **Precipitate G and substance B:** The precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, analogous to aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃. When heated, aluminum hydroxide decomposes, releasing water. Therefore, Al(OD)₃ will decompose to release heavy water (D₂O), which is substance B.\n*   **Melting point of B:** The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. To convert this to Kelvin, we add 273.15. So, 3.82 + 273.15 = 276.97 K. This value is \"very close to 277 K\", confirming the identity of B.\n*   **Keto acid reaction:** LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing carboxylic acids and esters to primary alcohols. Therefore, it can reduce an α-keto acid (which contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group) to a diol, which would contain two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The lightest element in LiAlD₄ is hydrogen (atomic number 1), present as its heavier isotope deuterium (D). The atomic mass of deuterium is approximately 2.014 amu. For the calculation, we will use the mass number 2.\n    *   The heaviest element in LiAlD₄ is aluminum (atomic number 13). Its only stable isotope is aluminum-27. The atomic mass is approximately 26.98 amu. For the calculation, we will use the mass number 27.\n\n**Calculation**\n\nBased on the confirmed identity of Substance X as LiAlD₄, the elements and their cumulative masses are as follows:\n\n1.  **Lightest element:** Hydrogen, present as 4 atoms of Deuterium (²H or D).\n    *   Cumulative mass of the lightest element = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n2.  **Heaviest element:** Aluminum, present as 1 atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al).\n    *   Cumulative mass of the heaviest element = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is the sum of these values:\nTotal mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substance X**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"**\n        This immediately suggests that Substance X contains an element with a common, stable heavy isotope. The most frequent examples in chemistry are Deuterium (D or ²H), which is a heavy isotope of Hydrogen, and Carbon-13 (¹³C).\n\n    *   **Clue 2: \"...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**\n        A violent reaction suggests a highly reactive substance, such as a strong reducing agent or a reactive metal hydride. Let's examine potential gases (W) where the total number of protons (p) equals the total number of neutrons (n):\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** A molecule of D₂ consists of two Deuterium atoms (²H). Each has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Total: p=2, n=2. This fits the criterion and strongly supports the idea that X is a deuterated compound.\n        *   **¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas):** Each nitrogen atom has 7p and 7n. Total: p=14, n=14. This fits, but it's harder to connect to the other clues.\n        *   **CD₄ (Deuteromethane):** Composed of ¹²C (6p, 6n) and four D atoms (1p, 1n each). Total: p = 6 + 4(1) = 10; n = 6 + 4(1) = 10. This is also a possibility.\n        Let's proceed with the D₂ hypothesis as it is the simplest and most direct consequence of a deuterated substance reacting. For a reaction to release pure D₂ gas, a deuteride (Substance X) would need to react with a deuterated solvent (Liquid Y), like heavy water (D₂O).\n\n    *   **Let's form a hypothesis:**\n        *   Substance X is a deuteride salt. A very common one is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n        *   Liquid Y is heavy water, **D₂O**.\n        *   Gas W is **D₂**.\n        *   The reaction would be: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n        This reaction is violent, produces D₂ gas (p=n), and forms a precipitate, Aluminum Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). This fits perfectly so far.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: \"...a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        From our hypothesis, the precipitate G is **Al(OD)₃**. When metal hydroxides (or deuteroxides) are heated, they decompose to form the metal oxide and water (or heavy water).\n        *   Reaction: `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n        *   So, substance B is **D₂O**.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This value is indeed \"very close to 277 K\". This provides strong confirmation for our hypothesis.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent. A keto acid possesses two functional groups that can be reduced: a ketone (`-C=O`) and a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). LiAlD₄ reduces a ketone to a secondary alcohol (`-CD(OH)-`) and a carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (`-CD₂(OH)`). Therefore, the reaction product would be a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This clue is also satisfied.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**\n        LiAlD₄ (Substance X) is used in organic synthesis, particularly for isotopic labeling. Its \"very close analog\" is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (**LiAlH₄**), which is one of the most common and powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. This clue fits perfectly.\n\n2.  **Conclusion on Identity**\n    All clues consistently point to Substance X being **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in LiAlD₄.\n\n    *   **Elements present:**\n        *   Lithium (Li), Atomic number Z=3\n        *   Aluminum (Al), Atomic number Z=13\n        *   Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D), Atomic number Z=1\n    *   **Lightest and Heaviest:**\n        *   Lightest element (by Z) is Hydrogen.\n        *   Heaviest element (by Z) is Aluminum.\n    *   **Mass Calculation:** We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes present.\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D), which is ²H. Mass number = 2.\n        *   The most abundant isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al. Mass number = 27.\n        *   The formula is LiAlD₄. There is 1 atom of Aluminum and 4 atoms of Deuterium.\n    *   **Summation:**\n        *   Total mass from heaviest element (Aluminum) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n        *   Total mass from lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Cumulative mass = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Gas W**\n        The gas W released has a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine simple molecules:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen gas): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Deuterium (D or ²H) is an isotope of hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect match.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Possible, but less likely in this reaction context.\n        *   D₂ is the most plausible candidate for W, especially given the next clue.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance B**\n        Precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is ~277 K.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n        *   This value is \"very close to 277 K\". Therefore, B is heavy water, D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: The Reaction**\n        *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G.\n        *   Since heating G produces B (D₂O), G is likely a metal deuteroxide (a metal hydroxide with D instead of H). Example: M(OD)n.\n        *   The production of D₂ gas strongly suggests that both the reagent (X) and the liquid it reacts with (Y) are sources of deuterium. If X were a deuteride and Y were normal water (H₂O), the product would be HD gas, not D₂.\n        *   Therefore, the reaction is likely: `Deuterated Reagent (X) + Heavy Water (Y=D₂O) -> Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ gas (W)`. The violent nature of the reaction points towards X being a highly reactive deuterated compound, like a metal deuteride or a complex metal deuteride.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Substance X and its use**\n        *   X contains a heavier isotope (we've established this is Deuterium).\n        *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This strongly suggests a common reagent pair like LiAlH₄ / LiAlD₄ or NaBH₄ / NaBD₄.\n        *   Let's test the most likely candidate: X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride). Its analog is LiAlH₄ (Lithium Aluminium Hydride), an extremely common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n        *   Let's see if X = LiAlD₄ fits the reaction:\n            `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n        *   This reaction is known to be violent. Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate (G). The gas produced is D₂ (W). This fits perfectly.\n        *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause decomposition: `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`. This correctly produces B (D₂O).\n\n    *   **Clue 5: The Keto Acid Reaction**\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has two functional groups: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both groups to alcohols.\n        *   Ketone (>C=O) → Secondary alcohol (>CD-OH)\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) → Primary alcohol (-CD₂OH)\n        *   So, a keto acid like R-C(=O)-R'-COOH is reduced to a diol: R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH.\n        *   The final product is a diol, which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms that X is LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\n\n    *   We have identified Substance X as **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements present in X. We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Comparing the elements:\n        *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1)\n        *   Middle element: Lithium (Atomic Number 3)\n        *   Heaviest element: Aluminium (Atomic Number 13)\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all Hydrogen (Deuterium) atoms and all Aluminium atoms. For this calculation, we use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n        *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n          Total mass from Hydrogen atoms = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium. The most common and stable isotope is ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27.\n          Total mass from Aluminium atoms = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass** = (Total mass from lightest element) + (Total mass from heaviest element)\n        Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nBased on the detailed step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Substance B**, with a melting point near 277 K (3.85 °C), is identified as **heavy water (D₂O)**, which melts at 3.82 °C. This reveals the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D)**.\n2.  **Substance X** reacts violently with a liquid **Y** (identified as D₂O) to produce a gas **W** and a precipitate **G**.\n3.  The precipitate **G**, upon heating, releases B (D₂O), which is characteristic of a metal deuteroxide decomposing. Thus, **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n4.  The gas **W** has an equal number of protons and neutrons. The reaction between a metal deuteride and D₂O produces Deuterium gas (D₂). A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the description. So, **W is D₂**.\n5.  **Substance X** and its analog are common reagents in organic chemistry. This clue, combined with its nature as a reactive metal deuteride, points towards Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (**LiAlD₄**), whose analog is the common reducing agent LiAlH₄.\n6.  The final clue confirms this: the reaction of a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) with X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid into a diol, a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms **X is LiAlD₄**.\n7.  The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   Using their integer mass numbers: Li=7, Al=27, D=2.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum (Al)** with a mass of 27.\n    *   The lightest element is **Deuterium (D)** with a mass of 2.\n    *   The formula LiAlD₄ contains one atom of the heaviest element (Al) and four atoms of the lightest element (D).\n    *   The cumulative mass is the sum of the masses of all these atoms: (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue 6: \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        *   277 Kelvin is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   This temperature is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   However, it is extremely close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C.\n        *   Therefore, substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n    *   **Clue 1 & 5: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope...\" and \"when heated, [precipitate G] releases B.\"**\n        *   Since B is D₂O, the precipitate G must contain deuterium (D). G decomposes upon heating to release D₂O, which is a characteristic property of a metal deuteroxide (similar to how a metal hydroxide decomposes into a metal oxide and water). So, G is likely a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ.\n        *   Since G is formed from the reaction of X and Y, the deuterium must originate from one or both of these reactants. Clue 1 states X contains a heavier isotope, which strongly suggests **Substance X contains Deuterium (D)**.\n\n    *   **Clue 8: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**\n        *   This points towards common deuterated reagents. The most common analogs are powerful reducing agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n        *   This suggests that substance X could be Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄) or Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n    *   **Clue 2, 3, 4: Reaction of X with Y**\n        *   The reaction is violent (clue 2), releases a gas W (clue 3), and forms a precipitate G (clue 4).\n        *   Crucially, gas W's molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's test some possibilities:\n            *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n            *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1). (Yes)**\n            *   N₂ (as ¹⁴N₂): 14 protons (7+7), 14 neutrons (7+7). (Yes)\n            *   CO (as ¹²C¹⁶O): 14 protons (6+8), 14 neutrons (6+8). (Yes)\n        *   Let's test the hypothesis that **X = LiAlD₄**. LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water. So let's assume Y is a form of water. The reaction must produce D₂ gas.\n        *   Let's test the reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (s) + 4D₂ (g)`\n        *   Let's check if this fits the clues:\n            *   **Liquid Y = D₂O** (heavy water). This is consistent.\n            *   **Gas W = D₂**. As shown above, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n            *   **Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃** (Aluminium deuteroxide). This is a solid precipitate. This fits.\n            *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) gives aluminum oxide and heavy water: `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. The released substance is D₂O, which we identified as B. This fits perfectly.\n        *   The alternative, `LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O -> LiOH + Al(OH)₃(s) + 4HD(g)`, would produce HD gas, which has 2 protons and 1 neutron, so this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Clue 7: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group (e.g., Pyruvic acid: CH₃-C(=O)-COOH), and thus has 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols.\n        *   `R-C(=O)-COOH --(LiAlD₄/H₂O workup)--> R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH)`\n        *   The product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups, -OH). It contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms that X is a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". It also clarifies: \"...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Elements Present:** Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminium (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (H).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium (Al).\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of *all atoms* of these two elements in the formula unit.\n    *   **Mass of Aluminium:** There is 1 atom of Aluminium (²⁷Al).

The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Mass from H (as D) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from H) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Final Answer Selection**\n\n    *   The calculated cumulative mass is 35.

This confirms the identity of B as D₂O. The violent reaction of X with a liquid to produce deuterated products (G and W) strongly implies the liquid Y is also D₂O.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The reaction of metal deuterides with D₂O produces D₂ gas. D₂ (deuterium gas) is a molecule where the number of protons (2) equals the number of neutrons (2), fitting the description of gas W.\n\n*   **Precipitate G:** The reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O would produce LiOD and Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate, which would make the deuterated version, Al(OD)₃, a precipitate as well. Heating a metal deuteroxide like Al(OD)₃ would release D₂O, which is substance B.\n\n*   **Substance X:** The logic pointed to Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). The search results confirm that its close analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a powerful and common reducing agent in organic chemistry. Crucially, LiAlH₄ is capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. Therefore, its reaction with an α-keto acid (R-CO-COOH), which contains a ketone and a carboxylic acid group, would reduce both to produce a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This resulting diol contains exactly two oxygen atoms, perfectly matching the final clue in the problem statement. The less potent reducing agent, NaBH₄, is generally not reactive enough to reduce carboxylic acids, making LiAlD₄ the correct choice for X.\n\nThe logical deduction that substance X is LiAlD₄ is well-supported.\n\nThe final step is the calculation:\n*   **Substance X:** Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as its heavier isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (by atomic number).\n*   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (by atomic number).\n*   **Instruction:** Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements. \"If multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... isotopes must be summed.\"\n*   **Mass of the lightest element's atoms (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of Deuterium (²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu. Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8 amu.\n*   **Mass of the heaviest element's atoms (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al). The mass is approximately 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative mass:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n### Unraveling the Chemical Puzzle\n\nBased on the series of clues provided, the unknown substances and reactions can be identified through a step-by-step deduction:\n\n1.  **Identifying Substance B and Gas W:** The melting point of substance B is stated to be very close to 277 K (3.85°C). This is the characteristic melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction also releases a gas W whose molecules contain an equal number of neutrons and protons. A strong candidate for this gas is **deuterium gas (D₂)**. Each deuterium atom has one proton and one neutron, so a D₂ molecule has two protons and two neutrons.\n\n2.  **Identifying Substance X:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields D₂O. This suggests a powerful reducing agent that contains deuterium. A well-known class of reagents in organic chemistry that fits this description is metal hydrides. The most common analog mentioned is **lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Therefore, Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope, is **lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. The clue about the reaction with a keto acid producing a compound with two oxygen atoms aligns with the known reactivity of LiAlH₄, which reduces the keto group but not the carboxylic acid group.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Reaction:** The violent reaction can be deduced as the reaction between LiAlD₄ (Substance X) and D₂O (Liquid Y).\n    *   **Reaction:** `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent, analogous to the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water.\n    *   It produces deuterium gas (W).\n    *   It forms a precipitate G, which is aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (and lithium deuteroxide, LiOD). Aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) causes it to decompose, releasing heavy water B (D₂O). The corresponding reaction for aluminum hydroxide is `2 Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 H₂O`.\n\n### Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Masses\n\nThe final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** By atomic number, the lightest element is **Hydrogen** (Z=1) and the heaviest element is **Aluminum** (Z=13). Lithium (Z=3) is in between.\n*   **Mass Contribution:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses, considering all instances of these elements in the molecule. For simplicity and as the options are integers, we will use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The stable isotope is Al-27.\n        *   Mass contribution from Al = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** The isotope present is Deuterium (D), and there are four atoms. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Mass contribution from D = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** The sum of these masses is:\n    *   27 (from Aluminum) + 8 (from Deuterium) = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe detailed chemical puzzle can be solved step-by-step to identify the substances involved and perform the required calculation.\n\n*   **Identifying Substance B:** The melting point of Substance B is stated to be very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the characteristic melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K.\n*   **Identifying the Heavier Isotope:** Since B is heavy water, the heavier isotope incorporated in Substance X must be deuterium (D or ²H), which is a stable isotope of hydrogen containing one proton and one neutron.\n*   **Identifying Substance X:** The clue that Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry, particularly for reactions with keto acids, points towards a powerful reducing agent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common reagent of this type. Its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits the description of containing a heavy isotope.\n*   **Confirming the Reactions:**\n    *   **Reaction of X with Y:** The violent reaction described is consistent with the reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O). Let's assume liquid Y is D₂O. The reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is known to be vigorous.\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas released is D₂. A molecule of D₂ contains two protons (one from each deuterium atom) and two neutrons (one from each deuterium atom), satisfying the condition that the number of protons and neutrons are equal.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** In the reaction above, Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is formed as a precipitate.\n    *   **Formation of B from G:** When heated, aluminum hydroxide (and its deuterated analog) decomposes. The reaction is 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Systematic Identification of Substances\nThe most reliable method to solve this puzzle is to identify each unknown substance based on the most definitive clues.\n\n*   **Substance B**: The melting point is \"very close to 277 K\". This is approximately 3.85 °C. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This strongly indicates that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n*   **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Since the reaction involves deuterium, a logical candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, satisfying the condition.\n*   **Substance X and its Analogs**: The problem states that X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A further clue is that X reduces a keto acid (which has at least 3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates a very powerful reducing agent, as it must reduce both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. A prime candidate for the analog is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). This makes **Substance X Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   **Reaction and Other Substances**: With the identities of X, W, and B established, we can deduce the entire reaction. LiAlD₄ (X) would react violently with a liquid deuterium source, which must be heavy water (Y = D₂O), to produce D₂ gas (W). The reaction is:\n    LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)\n    This reaction forms a precipitate **(G)**, which is **Aluminum Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**. When heated, G decomposes to release heavy water (B), which is consistent with the final clue: `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O (B)`.\n\n### Step 2: Final Calculation\nHaving confidently identified Substance X as **LiAlD₄**, the final calculation can be performed.\n\n*   **Task**: Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in LiAlD₄.\n*   **Constituent Elements**: The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest**: Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest element is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Sum the Masses**: The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula, using the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum)**: There is **one** atom of the stable isotope ²⁷Al. Its mass is 27 amu.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen)**: There are **four** atoms of the isotope Deuterium (²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is 2 amu. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n*   **Cumulative Mass**: The final sum is the mass from aluminum plus the mass from all deuterium atoms.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nThe step-by-step logical deduction is robust and all clues lead to the identity of Substance X as LiAlD₄. The subsequent calculation correctly yields a value of 35. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction:** Since heating G produces D₂O (B), G must be a compound that contains D₂O (like a deuterated hydrate) or can decompose to form it (like a metal deuteroxide).

A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has at least three oxygen atoms. A reduction that produces a product with two oxygens would be the conversion of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to alcohol groups (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This is characteristic of strong reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   The clue \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" fits perfectly. LiAlH₄ is a powerful and common reagent, and its \"very close analog\" is Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), another extremely common reagent.\n    *   The first clue states X incorporates a \"heavier isotope.\" The deuterated version of LiAlH₄ is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.

The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C), while the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). Given the clue about a heavier isotope, B is identified as **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released in a reaction and its molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's consider the reaction that produces B (D₂O). Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide. The violent reaction of X with liquid Y produces gas W and precipitate G. If the final products involve deuterium, it is highly likely that the reactants do as well. A plausible candidate for gas W is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify Liquid Y:** For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, the deuterated substance X must react with a deuterium source. This makes liquid Y **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is consistent with the identification of substance B.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** Substance X contains a heavy isotope, is a reagent in organic chemistry, and reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. A prime candidate for X is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is violent.\n    *   **Gas W:** D₂ is produced, which matches our earlier deduction.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, would form a precipitate.\n    *   **Heating G:** When heated, aluminum hydroxide (and by extension, deuteroxide) decomposes to form aluminum oxide and water (or in this case, D₂O, which is substance B).\n    *   **Organic Reagent:** LiAlD₄ and its common analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), are powerful and widely used reducing agents in organic chemistry.\n    *   **Reaction with Keto Acid:** A keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) when reduced by a strong agent like LiAlH₄ (or LiAlD₄) yields a diol (containing 2 oxygen atoms), which matches the description.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (present as 4 atoms of the Deuterium isotope).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (present as 1 atom).\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   We will use the mass numbers for this calculation, as the options are integers.\n    *   Mass number of Deuterium (D) is 2.\n    *   Mass number of Aluminum (Al) is 27.\n\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Deuterium):** 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Total Cumulative Mass:** 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Chemical Riddle:** I will analyze the clues provided to identify the unknown substances, particularly Substance X.\n    *   **Clue 1: Melting point of B.** The melting point of B is ~277 K, which is approximately 4°C. This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O). So, B is D₂O.\n    *   **Clue 2: Formation of B.** B (D₂O) is released when precipitate G is heated. This implies G is a deuterated hydrate or hydroxide, like a metal deuteroxide, which decomposes upon heating.\n    *   **Clue 3: The Reaction.** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. This is a classic pattern for a reactive metal hydride/deuteride reacting with water/heavy water.\n    *   **Clue 4: Gas W.** Gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. If the reaction involves deuterated compounds, a likely candidate for W is deuterium gas, D₂ (2 protons, 2 neutrons).\n    *   **Clue 5: Putting it together.** If X is a deuteride and it reacts with Y=D₂O, the reaction would be: `Metal-Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) -> Metal-Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`. This is consistent with all clues so far.\n    *   **Clue 6: Organic Chemistry Context.** X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its reaction with a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a strong reducing agent, capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol (which has 2 oxygens).\n    *   **Clue 7: Identifying X.** A very common strong reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits all the clues perfectly. It reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and precipitates of LiOD and Al(OD)₃. Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its heavier isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The problem asks for the cumulative atomic mass of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Mass of all Hydrogen atoms: There are 4 Deuterium (D) atoms. The mass of one D atom is ~2 amu. Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of all Aluminum atoms: There is 1 Aluminum (Al) atom. The mass of the stable isotope of Al is ~27 amu. Total mass = 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   The final sum is 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will define the counts and masses of the identified atoms and perform the final summation.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

We need a molecule with an equal number of protons (p) and neutrons (n).\n        *   H₂: 2p, 0n. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D has 1p and 1n. So D₂ has 2p and 2n. **This is a perfect match.**\n        *   CO₂: C(6p, 6n), O(8p, 8n). Total = 22p, 22n. **This is also a match.**\n        *   N₂O: N(7p, 7n), O(8p, 8n). Total = 22p, 22n. **This is also a match.**\n    *   However, the formation of D₂ gas strongly aligns with the \"heavier isotope\" clue. A violent reaction producing D₂ suggests a powerful deuteride reacting with a deuterium source.\n    *   The most common liquid deuterium source (Liquid Y) is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   So, we hypothesize: **X is a deuteride, Y is D₂O, and W is D₂.**\n\n*   **Clue 3:** \"...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   277 K is approximately 4 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is \"very close to 277 K\". So, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   G is a precipitate that releases D₂O upon heating. This means G is a deuterated hydroxide (a metal hydroxide containing D instead of H).\n    *   Let's test potential candidates for X (strong deuterides):\n        *   If X = NaBD₄ (Sodium borodeuteride): `NaBD₄ + 4 D₂O → NaB(OD)₄ + 4 D₂`. The product, sodium borate, is soluble. No precipitate G would form.\n        *   If X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium aluminum deuteride): `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4 D₂(g)`. Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate. This fits the description of G.\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause decomposition: `2 Al(OD)₃(s) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3 D₂O(g)`. This releases B (D₂O).\n    *   This confirms that **X = LiAlD₄**, **Y = D₂O**, **W = D₂**, **G = Al(OD)₃**, and **B = D₂O**.\n\n*   **Clue 4:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH).\n    *   X (LiAlD₄) is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   `R-CO-COOH + LiAlD₄ → (intermediate) → (after workup) → R-CD(OH)-CD₂OH`\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This clue is consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Clue 5:** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   X is LiAlD₄. Its \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄ (Lithium aluminum hydride), which is one of the most common and powerful reducing agents in synthetic organic chemistry. This strongly confirms our identification.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the required value.**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope, Deuterium, D).\n*   We identify the lightest and heaviest elements by their atomic number (number of protons).\n    *   Hydrogen (H/D): Atomic Number = 1  **(Lightest)**\n    *   Lithium (Li): Atomic Number = 3\n    *   Aluminum (Al): Atomic Number = 13 **(Heaviest)**\n*   The question specifies to sum the masses of all instances of these elements. We will use the mass number (protons + neutrons) for the calculation.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of Deuterium (D₄). The mass number of Deuterium (¹p + ¹n) is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum. The most stable and common isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** We sum the total masses from the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass from Hydrogen isotopes) + (Mass from Aluminum isotopes)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n**Step 3: Final Answer.**\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle to determine Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Identification\n\n1.  **Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is stated to be \"very close to 277 K\". The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K, which is approximately 3.82°C. This is remarkably close to 277 K, strongly suggesting that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0°C), which is not as close.\n\n2.  **Precipitate G**: Precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a deuterated hydroxide, which decomposes upon heating to form a metal oxide and heavy water. A plausible candidate for such a precipitate is aluminum hydroxide's deuterated analog, **Al(OD)₃**. Upon heating, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n\n3.  **Substance X and its Reaction**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W and precipitate G.\n    *   **Gas W**: The problem states that the molecules of gas W have an equal number of protons and neutrons. Deuterium gas (**D₂**) fits this description perfectly. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Substance X**: A reagent used in organic chemistry that contains a heavier isotope and reacts to form the products identified above is **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. It is a powerful reducing agent and a close analog of the very common Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Liquid Y**: For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, LiAlD₄ would need to react with a source of deuterium, making **heavy water (D₂O)** the logical identity for liquid Y.\n    *   **The Reaction**: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4D₂ (gas W). This reaction is known to be violent, similar to the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water.\n\n4.  **Confirmation with Keto Acid Reaction**: The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, totaling 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (-CD₂(OH)). The resulting product, a diol, would contain 2 oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the clue.\n\n### Calculation\n\nHaving confidently identified Substance X as **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, we can proceed with the calculation.\n\n1.  **Elements in Substance X**: The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its heavier isotope, Deuterium, D).\n\n2.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**:\n    *   Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Z=13).\n\n3.  **Sum of Atomic Masses**: The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule, summing all isotopes of each. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation as implied by the answer choices.\n    *   **Mass of the Lightest Element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms of the Deuterium (²H) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass of the Heaviest Element (Aluminum)**: There is one atom of Aluminum. The most common and stable isotope is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n\n4.  **Cumulative Sum**:\n    *   Sum = (Mass of all Deuterium atoms) + (Mass of all Aluminum atoms)\n    *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses.\n\n### Identification of the Substances\n\n1.  **Substance B**: The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K. This is approximately 3.85°C or 38.9°F. This value is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O).\n\n2.  **Substance X and its Isotope**: The presence of heavy water (D₂O) as a product strongly suggests that the heavier isotope in Substance X is deuterium (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n3.  **Organic Chemistry Context**: The problem states that Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. It also mentions that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group. A powerful reducing agent would reduce both groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of Substance X.\n\n4.  **Reaction with Liquid Y**: LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic solvents like water. Let's test the reaction with heavy water (D₂O) as Liquid Y.\n    *   **Reaction**: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n    *   **Gas W**: The gas released is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium molecule (D₂) consists of two deuterons, each having 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, the molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the description that the number of protons and neutrons are equal.\n    *   **Precipitate G**: The products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). While LiOD is soluble, Al(OD)₃ is insoluble and would form a precipitate.\n    *   **Heating G**: When aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) is heated, it decomposes to aluminium oxide and water. Similarly, heating aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) would release heavy water (B, D₂O).\n\nAll clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄). The phrasing \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" is a key instruction.\n\n1.  **Elements in LiAlD₄**: The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n\n2.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**:\n    *   Based on atomic number and mass, Hydrogen is the lightest element, and Aluminium is the heaviest element.\n\n3.  **Summing the Masses**:\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms of the lightest element, all of which are the deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of deuterium is 2. Therefore, the total mass contributed by the lightest element is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium)**: There is one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminium (Al). The mass number of the most common isotope of aluminium is 27.\n\n4.  **Cumulative Mass**: The cumulative mass is the sum of the total masses of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass of Hydrogen isotopes) + (Total mass of Aluminium isotopes)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThus, the cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the clues provided:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is close to 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This strongly suggests that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G:** Precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a deuterated hydroxide. Given the subsequent reactions, **G is aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**. Heating Al(OD)₃ causes it to decompose into aluminum oxide and heavy water (2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O).\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) and a gas W. The clue that \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common reducing agents. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful and widely used reducing agent. Its close analog containing a heavier isotope of hydrogen would be **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits the description of substance X.\n\n4.  **Identify Gas W and Confirm the Reaction:** If X is LiAlD₄, it would react with a deuterated solvent to produce the precipitate Al(OD)₃. Let's assume liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O). The reaction would be:\n    LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n\n    Now, let's check if gas W (D₂) fits the description \"its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   A deuterium (D) atom contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A D₂ molecule, therefore, contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    This matches the description perfectly. Thus, the identified substances and the reaction are consistent with all the clues.\n\n5.  **Verify the Keto Acid Reaction:** The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. A keto acid contains both a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. The reduction of both of these functional groups would result in a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains two oxygen atoms. This confirms the identity of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n    *   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1). In LiAlD₄, it is present as 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13). In LiAlD₄, it is present as 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the stable isotope of aluminum is 27.\n    *   **Intermediate Element:** Lithium (Atomic Number 3). The most common isotope has a mass number of 7.\n\n    The question asks for the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n\n    *   **Total mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium):** There are 4 deuterium atoms. Mass = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 aluminum atom. Mass = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n    **Cumulative Atomic Mass** = (Total mass of Deuterium) + (Total mass of Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is very close to the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   Therefore, substance B is D₂O.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G and Gas W:**\n    *   Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a compound that contains deuterium and oxygen and decomposes upon heating to release D₂O. A metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, is a likely candidate, as it would decompose to a metal oxide and D₂O (e.g., Ca(OD)₂ → CaO + D₂O).\n    *   Gas W is released during the reaction and its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple molecules:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely in this context)\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely)\n    *   Given that D₂O is involved, the most plausible identity for gas W is D₂.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Substances X and Y:**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ).\n    *   The reaction produces both D₂ and M(OD)ₓ. To form D₂, the reactants must supply deuterium. To form the deuteroxide, the reactants must supply the metal (M), oxygen (O), and deuterium (D).\n    *   The problem states that X incorporates a \"heavier isotope,\" which we've identified as deuterium (D). So, X must be a deuterated compound.\n    *   Let's propose a general reaction: A deuteride (from X) reacts with an oxygen source (Y). If the gas produced is D₂, a plausible reaction is the reaction of a deuteride with D₂O.\n    *   Let X be a metal deuteride and Y be D₂O. The reaction would be: `Metal Deuteride + D₂O → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`.\n    *   This reaction type is known for being violent, especially with reactive metal hydrides/deuterides.\n\n4.  **Use the Organic Chemistry Clues to Pinpoint X:**\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards a common reagent.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid has the general formula R-C(=O)-COOH, which contains 3 oxygen atoms. The reaction with X reduces the number of oxygen atoms to 2. This means X is a reducing agent.\n    *   Common hydride reducing agents in organic chemistry include sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄. LiAlH₄ is an \"especially\" common and powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n        *   **Analog:** LiAlH₄ is a very common reagent. This fits perfectly.\n        *   **Reaction with Y=D₂O:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n        *   **Violent?** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent.\n        *   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂ gas. This fits.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** The reaction produces LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (aluminium deuteroxide), which is a gelatinous precipitate analogous to Al(OH)₃. This fits.\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause decomposition: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases D₂O (Substance B). This fits.\n        *   **Reaction with keto acid:** LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group of a keto acid (R-C(=O)-COOH) to alcohols, forming a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). The starting keto acid has 3 oxygen atoms, and the final diol product has 2 oxygen atoms. This fits perfectly.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues point to Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.

A reduction reaction is required to lower the oxygen count to 2 (by converting both the ketone and carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). This means **X is a strong reducing agent**.\n    *   **Clue 3:** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common pair of reagents where one is the deuterated version of the other. The most famous strong reducing agent pairs are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Clue 4:** X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W (D₂) and form precipitate G. Let's test the hypothesis that **X is LiAlD₄**.\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent, fitting Clue 2.\n        *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent, fitting Clue 3.\n        *   It contains deuterium, fitting Clue 1.\n        *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with a deuterium source like heavy water (Y = D₂O) would be violent and produce D₂ gas.

Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Al): There is 1 atom of Aluminum. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from H) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a multi-step chemical puzzle. Let's break down the clues systematically to identify the unknown substances and arrive at the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The most specific clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   To convert Kelvin to Celsius, we use the formula: °C = K - 273.15.\n    *   277 K is approximately 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The problem states that gas W's molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Since we know Deuterium is involved, let's examine Deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A single Deuterium atom (symbol D or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A molecule of Deuterium gas (D₂) therefore contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   The number of protons equals the number of neutrons, so **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Identify X, Y, and G:**\n    *   The overall reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → Precipitate G + Gas W (D₂).\n    *   We are told the reaction is \"violent\".\n    *   We also know that precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is a characteristic decomposition of a metal deuteroxide, which breaks down into a metal oxide and heavy water. So, **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n    *   For the reaction to produce a metal deuteroxide (G) and deuterium gas (D₂), substance X must be a metal deuteride, and liquid Y must be D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is: X (Metal Deuteride) + Y (D₂O) → G (Metal Deuteroxide) + W (D₂).\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** We have two final, crucial clues about X:\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This strongly suggests a common hydride reducing agent. The most well-known are Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs, NaBD₄ and **LiAlD₄**, fit the description perfectly.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid contains two oxygen-bearing functional groups: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH). LiAlH₄ (and by extension, LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both of these groups to alcohols (-OH). The resulting product, a diol, would have exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms that X is a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄. (NaBD₄ is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids).\n\n    Therefore, we can confidently identify **Substance X as LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄). We will use the integer mass numbers for the relevant isotopes.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its most common isotope is 27.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (D):** There are four atoms of the isotope Deuterium. The mass number of Deuterium is 2. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** (Mass of Al) + (Total mass of D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Substance B**\n\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\nThis temperature is very close to the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\nThis, combined with the initial clue that Substance X contains a \"heavier isotope,\" strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n**2. Identify Precipitate G and the Reaction that Forms B**\n\nSubstance G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of the thermal decomposition of a metal hydroxide (or in this case, a metal deuteroxide). For example, a metal hydroxide decomposes into a metal oxide and water upon heating:\nM(OH)ₓ --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + H₂O\nTherefore, G must be a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes as follows:\nM(OD)ₓ --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + D₂O (Substance B)\n\n**3. Identify Gas W**\n\nGas W is released during the reaction of X and Y. The key property of W is that its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple gases:\n*   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. **(Protons = Neutrons)**. This is a strong candidate, especially since we've already identified D₂O in the reaction pathway.\n*   **¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas):** A ¹⁴N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. An N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. **(Protons = Neutrons)**. This is a possibility.\n*   **¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide):** A ¹²C atom has 6p, 6n. A ¹⁶O atom has 8p, 8n. A CO molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. **(Protons = Neutrons)**. This is also a possibility.\n*   **HD (Hydrogen deuteride):** 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p ≠ n).\n\nGiven that deuterium is clearly involved in the reaction (forming D₂O), D₂ is the most likely candidate for gas W.\n\n**4. Identify Substance X**\n\nWe have several clues about X:\n*   It contains a heavy isotope (Deuterium).\n*   It's a reagent used in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is especially common.\n*   It reacts with a liquid Y to produce a gas W (likely D₂), and a precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide).\n*   The product of its reaction with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. A reaction that reduces it to a product with 2 oxygens would be the reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to form a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which has 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a powerful reducing agent.\n\nA very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its analog containing a heavy isotope is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Let's see if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues.\n\n**5. Verify the Reaction Chemistry with X = LiAlD₄**\n\nLet's assume X is LiAlD₄. It is known to react violently with water. If liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction would be:\nLiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n\nLet's check the products against our deductions:\n*   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂ gas. As established, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (p=n). This fits.\n*   **Precipitate G:** The reaction produces Lithium Deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble in D₂O, and Aluminum Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Aluminum hydroxide is a well-known precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would be the precipitate G. This fits.\n*   **Heating G:** As determined earlier, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would produce an oxide and B (D₂O). This fits.\n*   **Organic Reagent:** LiAlH₄ is a staple in organic synthesis, and LiAlD₄ is its common deuterated analog. This fits.\n*   **Keto Acid Reaction:** LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is strong enough to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols, turning a keto acid into a diol, which has two oxygen atoms. This fits.\n\nAll clues point consistently to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The phrasing \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" indicates we need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Lightest Element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number):** Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   We will use integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes in the molecule: D (²H) has a mass of 2. The most common isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, with a mass of 27.\n\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D).\n    Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al).\n    Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K.\n2.  **Identify Substance G**: Precipitate G releases substance B (D₂O) upon heating. This indicates that G is a deuterated hydrate (a compound containing D₂O in its structure).\n3.  **Identify Gas W**: The gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. A simple molecule that fits this description is deuterium gas (D₂). Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n4.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G. The problem states that X contains a heavier isotope (which we know is deuterium, D) and that it and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of substance X perfectly. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water. For the reaction to produce deuterium gas (D₂), the other reactant must also be a source of deuterium. Therefore, liquid Y must be **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n5.  **Confirm the Reaction**: The reaction between Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (X) and heavy water (Y) is:\n    LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    This reaction produces deuterium gas (W) and aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a precipitate (G). Heating Al(OD)₃ yields aluminum oxide and heavy water (B). This confirms the identities of all substances.\n6.  **Confirm the Final Clue**: The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid into alcohol groups. The resulting product is a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. This final clue is consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n7.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass**: The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The molecule contains four atoms of the lightest element, in the form of Deuterium (²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu. The total mass from the lightest element is 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   The molecule contains one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminium. Aluminium's only stable isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass of approximately 27 amu. The total mass from the heaviest element is 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   The cumulative mass is the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided clues, the substances involved have been identified as follows:\n\n*   **Substance X**: Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). This is deduced from its nature as a powerful reducing agent (a close analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent in organic chemistry), its reaction to form the other identified products, and its role in the reduction of a keto acid. The reaction of a keto acid (containing a ketone and a carboxylic acid) with a strong reducing agent like LiAlH₄ (or its deuterated analog LiAlD₄) reduces both functional groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol which contains two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Liquid Y**: Heavy Water (D₂O). Its reaction with a deuteride source like LiAlD₄ is violent and produces the identified gas and precipitate.\n*   **Gas W**: Deuterium gas (D₂). A molecule of D₂ contains one proton and one neutron in each of its two atoms, for a total of two protons and two neutrons, fitting the description of having an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n*   **Precipitate G**: Aluminium Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). This is formed from the reaction of LiAlD₄ and D₂O.\n*   **Substance B**: Heavy Water (D₂O). When precipitate G, Al(OD)₃, is heated, it decomposes and releases heavy water. The melting point of heavy water is 276.97 K (3.82 °C), which is very close to the stated 277 K.\n\nThe core reaction is:\nLiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD\n\nWith Substance X identified as LiAlD₄, the final calculation can be performed. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within LiAlD₄.\n\n1.  **Elements in LiAlD₄**: Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n2.  **Atomic Masses (using mass numbers for isotopes)**:\n    *   Deuterium (²H or D): Mass number = 2\n    *   Lithium (assumed to be the most common isotope, ⁷Li): Mass number = 7\n    *   Aluminium (only stable isotope is ²⁷Al): Mass number = 27\n3.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**:\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (mass ≈ 2 u).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (mass ≈ 27 u).\n4.  **Cumulative Mass Calculation**: The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   There are four atoms of the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   There is one atom of the heaviest element (Aluminium): 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative mass is the sum of these values: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on the chemical puzzle provided, the following substances have been identified:\n\n*   **Substance X:** Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). This is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, analogous to the very common lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). It contains deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Liquid Y:** Heavy water (D₂O).\n*   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas (D₂). A molecule of D₂ contains one proton and one neutron in each atom, for a total of two protons and two neutrons, matching the description of having an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n*   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Lithium aluminum deuteride reacts violently with water (or heavy water) to produce a precipitate of aluminum hydroxide (or deuteroxide).\n*   **Substance B:** Heavy water (D₂O). The thermal decomposition of aluminum hydroxide yields alumina and water. Similarly, aluminum deuteroxide yields alumina and heavy water. The melting point of heavy water is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K. This is extremely close to the given 277 K. For comparison, normal water freezes at 273.15 K.\n\nThe reaction of a keto acid with LiAlD₄ (Substance X) would reduce the ketone group to an alcohol, resulting in a hydroxy acid which still contains two oxygen atoms, consistent with the clue.\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H) (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n2.  **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n3.  **Calculate the mass of the lightest element's atoms:** Substance X contains four atoms of the hydrogen isotope deuterium (²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n    *   Mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n4.  **Calculate the mass of the heaviest element's atoms:** Substance X contains one atom of aluminum. The stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n    *   Mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n5.  **Calculate the cumulative mass:** The sum of these masses is:\n    *   8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35 amu.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W, released during a violent reaction, has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple gas molecules:\n    *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p≠n)\n    *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p≠n)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p=n). This is a strong candidate, as deuterium is a \"heavier isotope\".\n    *   CO (Carbon monoxide, with ¹²C and ¹⁶O): 6p+8p = 14 protons; 6n+8n = 14 neutrons. (p=n). This is a possibility.\n    *   N₂ (Nitrogen gas, with ¹⁴N): 7p+7p = 14 protons; 7n+7n = 14 neutrons. (p=n). This is a possibility.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance B:** A precipitate G is formed, which upon heating releases substance B. The melting point of B is ~277 K (3.85 °C). This is the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C). The melting point of normal water, H₂O, is 273.15 K (0 °C). This strongly indicates that B is D₂O.\n\n3.  **Connect the Clues:** Since D₂O (B) is released from G, and D₂ (W) is a likely gas product, it's highly probable that we are dealing with a system involving deuterium. For the reaction to produce D₂ gas (W) and form a product G that contains deuterium (since it releases D₂O), both substance X and liquid Y must be sources of deuterium.\n    *   Let's hypothesize a reaction. A common violent reaction that produces hydrogen gas is the reaction of a metal hydride with water.\n    *   Let's assume X is a deuteride (containing a heavy isotope of hydrogen, D) and Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   Let's test a powerful reducing agent, Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄), as Substance X. Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, is famous in organic chemistry.\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   Let's check if this fits the clues:\n        *   **Substance X (LiAlD₄):** Contains a heavier isotope (D). Check.\n        *   **Liquid Y (D₂O):** A liquid. Check.\n        *   **Reaction:** The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is notoriously violent. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O would be similarly violent. Check.\n        *   **Gas W (D₂):** As established, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (p=n). Check.\n        *   **Precipitate G (Al(OD)₃):** Aluminium hydroxide is a gelatinous precipitate. Al(OD)₃ would be as well. Check.\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating aluminium hydroxide causes dehydration. Similarly, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield aluminium oxide and heavy water: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B).

The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass:** (Mass from Al) + (Mass from H) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the clues, the following substances have been identified:\n\n*   **Substance X:** Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). This is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, and it contains a heavier isotope of hydrogen (deuterium).\n*   **Liquid Y:** Heavy water (D₂O). LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water, and the use of heavy water is necessary to produce the specified gas.\n*   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas (D₂). The reaction between LiAlD₄ and D₂O produces D₂ gas. A deuterium molecule (D₂) contains two protons and two neutrons, fulfilling the condition of having an equal number of each.\n*   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). This is the precipitate formed from the reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O.\n*   **Substance B:** Heavy water (D₂O). Heating aluminum deuteroxide (G) causes it to decompose, releasing heavy water (B). The melting point of heavy water is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), which is very close to the stated 277 K.\n\nThe problem asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n2.  **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   Lithium (atomic number 3) is the intermediate element.\n3.  **Sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula:**\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of Hydrogen, present as Deuterium (D).

Identifying Substance X:**\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope...\" and \"...used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"** This points towards a common reagent where isotopic labeling is used, such as a deuterated compound. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common reagent, and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits this description perfectly.\n*   **Clue 2: \"...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**\n    *   LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic solvents like water. Let's assume Liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`.\n    *   The gas released (W) is Deuterium gas (D₂). A Deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This matches the clue perfectly.\n*   **Clue 3: \"...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B...is very close to 277 K.\"**\n    *   277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K), which is very close to 277 K. So, B is D₂O.\n    *   From the reaction above, the products are Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD, soluble) and Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃, a precipitate). So, G is Al(OD)₃.\n    *   Heating G (Aluminum deuteroxide) causes decomposition: `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. This releases B (D₂O), confirming the identification.\n*   **Clue 4: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols (-OH).\n    *   The reaction product would be a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups). This resulting molecule contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms.\n\nBased on all clues, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).**\n\n**2. Performing the Calculation:**\n\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n*   We need to find the lightest and heaviest elements present. Based on atomic mass, the lightest element is Hydrogen (as Deuterium) and the heaviest is Aluminum.\n*   The question asks for the *cumulative atomic masses* of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula. We'll use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n    *   **Lightest element (Deuterium, D or ²H):** Its mass number is 2. The formula LiAlD₄ contains 4 Deuterium atoms.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   **Heaviest element (Aluminum, Al):** Its most stable isotope is ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27. The formula contains 1 Aluminum atom.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 * 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative mass:** Sum of the total masses = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the elements and their isotopes in Substance X (LiAlD4).\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen, present as the isotope Deuterium (D).\n# The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al).\n# The other element is Lithium (Li).\n\n# Step 2: Define the mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n# Mass number of Deuterium (D, or 2H) is 2.\n# Mass number of the most stable isotope of Aluminum (27Al) is 27.\n\n# Step 3: Count the number of atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula LiAlD4.\nnum_deuterium_atoms = 4\nnum_aluminum_atoms = 1\n\n# Step 4: Define the mass numbers.\nmass_of_deuterium = 2\nmass_of_aluminum = 27\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the total mass contributed by all atoms of the lightest element.\ntotal_mass_lightest = num_deuterium_atoms * mass_of_deuterium\n\n# Step 6: Calculate the total mass contributed by all atoms of the heaviest element.\ntotal_mass_heaviest = num_aluminum_atoms * mass_of_aluminum\n\n# Step 7: Calculate the cumulative mass by summing the two totals.\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_lightest + total_mass_heaviest\n\n# Step 8: Print the final result.\nprint(f\"The lightest element is Deuterium (D).

A reaction that reduces the oxygen count to 2 implies a strong reduction. For example, the reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH2OH) results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This points towards a powerful reducing agent like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH4).\n    *   \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\" This suggests that X is an isotopically labeled version of a common reagent. Given the analog is likely LiAlH4, the heavier isotope is probably deuterium (D or ²H) replacing hydrogen (H). This makes **Substance X = LiAlD4** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n    *   \"Substance X... reacts violently with liquid Y... with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Hydrides like LiAlD4 react violently with protic solvents like water. Let's identify Y and W. The reaction produces hydrogen gas. If Y were regular water (H2O), the gas would be a mix including HD (2 protons, 1 neutron), which does not fit the description. If **liquid Y is heavy water (D2O)**, the reaction is LiAlD4 + 4 D2O → LiOD + Al(OD)3 + 4 D2. The gas released, **W = D2**, fits the description perfectly: a deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D2 molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   \"...a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B... is very close to 277 K.\" In the reaction above, the precipitate **G is Al(OD)3** (Aluminum deuteroxide). When heated, Al(OD)3 decomposes: 2 Al(OD)3 → Al2O3 + 3 D2O. The released substance **B is D2O**. The melting point of D2O is 276.97 K, which is very close to the stated 277 K.\n\n*   **Conclusion of Identification:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD4**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X.**\n\n*   Substance X is LiAlD4.\n*   The elements present in the molecule are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   Based on the periodic table (atomic number):\n    *   Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest element.\n    *   Aluminum (Z=13) is the heaviest element.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the cumulative atomic masses.**\n\n*   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within the molecule of X. This means summing the mass of all hydrogen atoms (isotopes) and all aluminum atoms.\n*   We will use the integer mass numbers for the relevant isotopes, which is standard for this type of problem.\n    *   The isotope of hydrogen present is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of 2.\n    *   The most common and stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule LiAlD4 contains four atoms of Deuterium.\n    *   Mass = 4 × (mass of one D atom) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule LiAlD4 contains one atom of Aluminum.\n    *   Mass = 1 × (mass of one Al atom) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   Total Mass = (Mass from Hydrogen isotopes) + (Mass from Aluminum)\n    *   Total Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The clue states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. Converting this to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C, but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an extremely close match, so we can confidently conclude that **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The problem mentions that substance X contains a \"heavier isotope\". Since we've identified D₂O, this isotope is very likely Deuterium (D, or ²H). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The gas W is said to have an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's test D₂ gas. A D₂ molecule has two deuterium atoms, so it contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. Thus, **W is D₂ (deuterium gas)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields D₂O. This suggests X is a powerful deuterated reducing agent.\n    *   The reaction of X with a keto acid produces a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (containing R-C(=O)-COOH) has at least 3 oxygen atoms. To reduce this to a product with 2 oxygens, both the ketone and the carboxylic acid must be reduced to alcohols, forming a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). The reduction of a carboxylic acid requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). The clue states that X has a \"very close analog\" used in organic chemistry. The deuterated version, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits this description.\n    *   Let's verify the reaction: LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic compounds like water (or in this case, likely D₂O) to produce D₂ gas and metal hydroxides (or deuteroxides): `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O → 4D₂ (W) + LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G)`. The precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide, which decomposes on heating to give aluminum oxide and heavy water (B): `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`.\n    *   All clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Mass:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements found in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is approximately **27 u**.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of Hydrogen, present as the isotope Deuterium (²H or D). The mass of one Deuterium atom is approximately **2 u**. The total mass from the four Deuterium atoms is 4 × 2 u = **8 u**.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum = (Total mass of Al) + (Total mass of D) = 27 + 8 = **35 u**.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses:\n\n**1. Identifying Substance X**\n\n*   **Heavier Isotope & Organic Chemistry Reagent:** The problem states that Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, along with its close analog. This points towards deuterated reducing agents, as deuterium (D or ²H) is a common heavy isotope used in organic synthesis. The most common of these reagents are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Reaction with Liquid Y:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce a gas W and a precipitate G.\n    *   **Gas W:** The key clue is that a molecule of gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n        *   Hydrogen gas (H₂): Each atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. A molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. (Incorrect)\n        *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Correct)\n    *   To produce D₂ gas, LiAlD₄ would need to react with a source of deuterium, meaning **Liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n\n*   **Precipitate G and Substance B:** The reaction produces lithium deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble, and aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), which is a precipitate. Therefore, **G is Al(OD)₃**. When aluminum hydroxide is heated, it decomposes to aluminum oxide and water. Similarly, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would produce aluminum oxide and heavy water (D₂O). Thus, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Melting Point of B:** The melting point of B is close to 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K. This is extremely close to the given value.\n\n*   **Reaction with a Keto Acid:** The problem states the product of the reaction between a keto acid and substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (and by extension LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. For instance, the reduction of an α-keto acid like pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH, which has 3 oxygen atoms) with LiAlH₄ yields 1,2-propanediol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH, which has 2 oxygen atoms). This matches the description.\n\nBased on this evidence, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n*   **Lightest Element:** The element with the lowest atomic number is Hydrogen (Z=1). In Substance X, it is present as its heavier isotope, Deuterium.\n*   **Heaviest Element:** The element with the highest atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The mass of the single heaviest element atom, Aluminum (²⁷Al), is approximately 27 amu.\n    *   The mass of the lightest element's isotopes must be summed. There are four atoms of Deuterium (²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu\n    *   Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35 amu\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical riddle to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. The melting point of water (H₂O) at normal pressure is 273.15 K (0 °C), while the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This strongly suggests that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W released has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's examine potential candidates:\n    *   Hydrogen deuteride (HD): 2 protons, 1 neutron.\n    *   Deuterium gas (D₂): A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    This perfectly matches the description, so **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope, which we've identified as deuterium (D). It is a reagent used in organic chemistry, with a very close analog. This points to common deuterated reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Their analogs are LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄. For substance X to react and release deuterium gas (D₂), it must react with a deuterium source. The violent reaction described points to **Liquid Y being heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction would be:\n    `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n\n4.  **Identify Precipitate G:** The reaction produces a precipitate G, which upon heating, releases B (D₂O). In the reaction above, the products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Aluminum hydroxide is known to be a precipitate. When heated, aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) decomposes to aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) and water (H₂O). By analogy, aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, would be the precipitate **G**, which decomposes upon heating to release heavy water, **D₂O (B)**.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Identity of Substance X:** The riddle states that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄)** is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid (R-CO-COOH) to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains two oxygen atoms. Therefore, LiAlD₄ would behave similarly.\n    *   **Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄)** is a milder reducing agent and typically reduces ketones but not carboxylic acids. The product would be a hydroxy acid (R-CH(OH)-COOH), which contains three oxygen atoms.\n    Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The final step is to calculate the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen. There are 4 atoms of its heavier isotope, Deuterium. The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu.\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum. There is 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass of an aluminum atom is approximately 27 amu.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element's atoms:** 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element's atoms:** 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** 8 + 27 = 35 amu.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical riddle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The clue states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 3.85°C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where D is the deuterium isotope of hydrogen, is 3.82°C (276.97 K).\n    *   This strongly indicates that **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Heavier Isotope and Substance X:**\n    *   Since B is D₂O, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the first clue is **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   Substance X incorporates this isotope and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, along with its \"very close analog\". This points to common deuterated reagents. The most common are lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) and sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Their non-deuterated analogs, LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄, are staple reducing agents in organic chemistry.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The riddle describes the reaction: Substance X + Liquid Y → Gas W + Precipitate G.\n    *   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W contains the same number of neutrons and protons. If we assume the gas is related to the deuterium isotope, Deuterium gas (D₂) fits this description perfectly. A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Reaction Confirmation:** For D₂ gas to be released, Substance X (the deuteride) must react with a source of deuterium. The most likely candidate for liquid Y is therefore heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   Let's test our candidates for X against this:\n        *   **If X is LiAlD₄:** LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂. This reaction produces D₂ gas.\n        *   **If X is NaBD₄:** NaBD₄ + 4 D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4 D₂. This reaction also produces D₂ gas.\n\n4.  **Use the Precipitate Clue to Distinguish X:** A precipitate G is formed.\n    *   In the LiAlD₄ reaction, the products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). LiOD is soluble, but aluminum hydroxide (and by extension, Al(OD)₃) is famously insoluble in water and forms a gelatinous precipitate.\n    *   In the NaBD₄ reaction, the products are sodium deuteroxide (NaOD) and boric acid-d₃ (B(OD)₃). Both NaOD and boric acid are soluble in water.\n    *   The formation of a precipitate strongly indicates that **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)** and the precipitate G is Al(OD)₃.\n\n5.  **Final Clue Confirmation:**\n    *   **Heating G releases B:** Heating aluminum hydroxide (or deuteroxide) causes it to decompose, releasing water (or heavy water): 2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O. This is consistent with G releasing B (D₂O).\n    *   **Reaction with keto acid:** Lithium aluminum hydride is a powerful reducing agent that reduces keto acids to diols. A keto acid contains a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group (3 oxygen atoms). The reduction product, a diol, contains two alcohol functional groups (2 oxygen atoms). This matches the clue that the product contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Violent Reaction:** LiAlH₄ is known to react violently with water. Its deuterated analog would behave similarly with heavy water. NaBH₄ reacts much more slowly with water, especially in neutral or basic conditions. The term \"violently\" further supports LiAlD₄ as Substance X.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (atomic mass ≈ 2 amu).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic mass ≈ 27 amu).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing all instances.\n    *   Mass of all lightest elements (4 Deuterium atoms): 4 × 2 amu = 8 amu.\n    *   Mass of all heaviest elements (1 Aluminum atom): 1 × 27 amu = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative sum: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Decipher the clues to identify Substance X, Y, W, G, and B.**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons.**\n    Let's examine potential simple gases formed in chemical reactions. We'll use the most common isotopes (e.g., ¹H, ¹²C, ¹⁴N, ¹⁶O, ¹⁹F).\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n    *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂):** 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n    *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Yes)\n    *   CO: 6p+8p=14 protons, 6n+8n=14 neutrons. (Yes)\n    *   HF: 1p+9p=10 protons, 0n+10n=10 neutrons. (Yes)\n    The first clue, \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope\", strongly points towards Deuterium (D). Therefore, **Gas W is most likely D₂.**\n\n*   **Clue 2: The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.**\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match.\n    Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O (heavy water).**\n\n*   **Clue 3: Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).**\n    This is a classic dehydration reaction. G is likely a metal hydroxide which, upon heating, decomposes into a metal oxide and water. Since the product is D₂O, G must be a deuterated metal hydroxide (a metal deuteroxide), M(OD)ₙ.\n    Reaction: M(OD)ₙ --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + D₂O (B).\n\n*   **Clue 4: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W (D₂) and form precipitate G (M(OD)ₙ).**\n    Since the products contain deuterium (D₂ and M(OD)ₙ), the reactants must provide the deuterium atoms. X is known to contain a heavy isotope (D), so the reaction must be X + Y -> D₂ + G. To produce D₂ gas and a deuteroxide precipitate, the liquid Y is almost certainly the deuterium source, **D₂O (heavy water)**, which is consistent with it being released from G upon heating.\n    So the reaction is: X + D₂O -> D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate).\n\n*   **Clue 5: Identifying Substance X.**\n    X reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas. This is characteristic of a powerful reducing agent, like a metal hydride or a complex metal hydride. The clue \"substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common lab reagents. Let's test the most common ones: Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). The deuterated versions would be NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n\n    *   If X = NaBD₄: The reaction with D₂O would be NaBD₄ + 4D₂O -> NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂. The products are sodium deuteroxide (soluble) and boric acid-d3 (soluble). No precipitate G would form. So, NaBD₄ is incorrect.\n    *   If X = LiAlD₄: The reaction with D₂O would be LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is a gelatinous precipitate, analogous to Al(OH)₃. This fits the description of precipitate G.\n\n*   **Clue 6: The keto acid reaction.**\n    This is the final confirmation. \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    A keto acid has a ketone (C=O) group and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n    Substance X is LiAlD₄, a very strong reducing agent. Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   Ketone (R-C(=O)-R') -> Secondary alcohol (R-CH(OH)-R')\n    *   Carboxylic acid (R-COOH) -> Primary alcohol (R-CH₂OH)\n    Applying this to a keto acid (R-C(=O)-COOH) with our substance X (LiAlD₄), both groups will be reduced:\n    R-C(=O)-COOH --(1. LiAlD₄ / 2. H₂O workup)--> R-CD(OH)-CD₂OH\n    The final product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups). Let's count the oxygen atoms: R-CD(**O**H)-CD₂**O**H. There are indeed **2 oxygen atoms**. This confirms our identification.\n\n    Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, LiAlD₄.**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the cumulative atomic masses.**\n\nThe question asks for \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The clause \"considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" clarifies that we must sum the masses of all atoms of the relevant elements.\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H). The isotope of hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n2.  **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   By atomic number: H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13). The lightest is Hydrogen, and the heaviest is Aluminum.\n3.  **Sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements.** We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved:\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (²H), mass number = 2.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, mass number = 27.\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Al. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of D. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative sum = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from H) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is my thinking process to solve this chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the problem into individual clues and analyze them one by one.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"** This immediately suggests we are dealing with isotopes, most commonly Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen) or possibly isotopes like ¹³C or ¹⁵N. Deuterium is a very common tracer and is used to make special reagents.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: \"...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"** This is a very specific and helpful clue. Let's analyze potential gases (W):\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   He (Helium): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Yes. But Helium is inert and unlikely to be produced in a violent chemical reaction.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Yes. This is a very strong candidate, especially given Clue 1.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Possible.\n        *   Let's consider molecules. D₂O (as steam): 10 protons (8 from O, 2 from D), 10 neutrons (8 from ¹⁶O, 2 from D). Yes.\n        *   Given the violent reaction, the production of a simple gas like D₂ from a deuterated reagent is chemically very plausible. Let's tentatively assume **W = D₂**.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: \"a precipitate G forms...\"** The reaction produces a solid that is insoluble in the reaction medium.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: \"...which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        *   Let's convert the temperature: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). This is close, but maybe not \"very close\".\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is *extremely* close to 277 K.\n        *   This strongly suggests that **B = D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"** This points towards common laboratory reagents.\n\n    *   **Clue 6: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"** A keto acid is a molecule with both a ketone functional group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This means the starting material has at least 3 oxygen atoms. The reaction with X causes a loss of one oxygen atom, which is characteristic of a reduction reaction (specifically, the reduction of the carboxylic acid to an alcohol).\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues:** Now I will piece together the deductions.\n\n    *   If B is D₂O, it must be released from heating the precipitate G. This means G contains deuterium and oxygen. A common reaction is the thermal decomposition of a metal hydroxide, like 2M(OH)₃ → M₂O₃ + 3H₂O. So, G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)ₓ.\n    *   The initial reaction is: X + Y → D₂ (gas W) + M(OD)ₓ (precipitate G).\n    *   For the products to be D₂ and M(OD)ₓ, the reactants must have contained M and D. Since the reaction is violent, it is likely a reaction of a very reactive deuteride (Substance X) with a source of deuterium oxide (Liquid Y).\n    *   Therefore, **Liquid Y must be heavy water, D₂O.**\n    *   The reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂ + M(OD)ₓ.\n    *   What could X be? It must be a powerful reducing agent to reduce D⁺ from D₂O to D₂ gas. It must also contain a metal (M) that forms an insoluble hydroxide/deuteroxide. Aluminum (Al) is a perfect candidate, as Al(OH)₃ is a well-known gelatinous precipitate.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that **X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, LiAlD₄**. Its \"very close analog\" is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), one of the most common and powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry (fitting Clue 5).\n    *   Let's check the reaction: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4D₂ (gas W). This fits perfectly.\n    *   Let's check the final clue (Clue 6). A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) reacts with LiAlD₄. LiAlD₄ is strong enough to reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols: R-CO-COOH + LiAlD₄ → R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH). The starting material has 3 oxygens, and the final product (a diol) has 2 oxygens. This also fits perfectly.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   My deduction is solid: **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". We should use integer mass numbers for the most common/relevant isotopes.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its heavier isotope, Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number Z=1).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number Z=13).\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen/Deuterium): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium (¹H²) is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its only stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum the two values.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning used to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Convert the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which contains a heavier isotope of hydrogen, is 3.82 °C.\n    *   The value 3.85 °C is a very close match to the melting point of D₂O. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Heavier Isotope and Gas W:**\n    *   Since B is identified as D₂O, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned must be **Deuterium (D)**. Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen with one proton and one neutron (mass number ≈ 2).\n    *   This means Substance X must contain Deuterium.\n    *   The reaction releases gas W, whose molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's consider Deuterium gas, D₂. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Function of Substance X:**\n    *   A keto acid (general formula R-C(=O)-COOH) contains one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group, for a total of **3 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The product of its reaction with X has only **2 oxygen atoms**. This indicates a reduction has occurred, for example, the reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid to alcohols, resulting in a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH) which has 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   This type of transformation requires a powerful reducing agent. Thus, **Substance X is a strong reducing agent**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We are looking for a common, strong reducing agent from organic chemistry that contains deuterium. The clue about its \"very close analog\" points to deuterated versions of common reagents. The most powerful common reducing agents are Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   Their deuterated analogs are **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)** and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n    *   Let's test these candidates against the reaction `X + Y(liquid) → D₂(gas) + G(precipitate)`. To produce D₂ gas, the liquid Y must be a deuterium source, such as D₂O.\n    *   Let's examine the reaction with X = LiAlD₄ and Y = D₂O:\n        `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`\n    *   This reaction fits all the given clues:\n        *   It is known to be **violent**.\n        *   It produces **D₂ gas (W)**.\n        *   It forms a **precipitate (G)**, Aluminium Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), which is the analog of the insoluble Aluminium Hydroxide.\n        *   When heated, the precipitate G decomposes to release substance B: `2 Al(OD)₃(s) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3 D₂O(g)`. This releases **D₂O (B)**.\n    *   The alternative, NaBD₄, would produce soluble products, not a precipitate. Therefore, we can confidently identify **Substance X as Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄), using integer mass numbers for the isotopes.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminium.\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements present in the molecule.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (²H), each with a mass number of 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is 1 atom of Aluminium (²⁷Al), with a mass number of 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative sum is 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This suggests the presence of isotopes like Deuterium (D), ¹³C, ¹⁵N, ¹⁸O, etc., instead of their lighter, more common counterparts.\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance X and its analog are used in organic chemistry.** This points towards a common reagent. Powerful reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are prime suspects. The deuterated versions (LiAlD₄, NaBD₄) are used for isotopic labeling.\n    *   **Clue 3: Reaction of X with a keto acid.** A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. The product having only 2 oxygen atoms implies a reduction reaction where both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups are reduced to alcohols. LiAlH₄ (and its analog LiAlD₄) is strong enough to perform this double reduction, yielding a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)), which has 2 oxygen atoms. This strongly supports X being LiAlD₄.\n    *   **Clue 4: Melting point of B is ~277 K.** 277 Kelvin is approximately 3.85°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K), but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is a very strong match. Thus, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 5: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and precipitate G. G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).**\n        *   Since G releases D₂O upon heating, G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, analogous to a metal hydroxide that releases H₂O upon heating (e.g., 2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O). So, G is likely Al(OD)₃.\n        *   This implies the reaction involves Aluminium and Deuterium. This further strengthens the case for X = LiAlD₄.\n        *   The violent reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is well-known. A similar violent reaction would occur between LiAlD₄ and a deuterated water source. Let's assume liquid **Y is D₂O**.\n        *   Let's write the reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n    *   **Clue 6: Gas W's molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons.** Let's check our proposed gas W, which is D₂.\n        *   Deuterium (D) is an isotope of Hydrogen (¹H) with 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n        *   A D₂ molecule contains (1+1) = 2 protons and (1+1) = 2 neutrons.\n        *   The number of protons and neutrons are equal. This perfectly matches the clue.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    All clues converge to identify Substance X as **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Atomic Number Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D, Z=1).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminium (Z=13).\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these elements in the molecule.\n    *   We use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved:\n        *   Deuterium (D or ²H) has a mass number of 2.\n        *   The most common and stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element's atoms:** There are four atoms of Deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element's atoms:** There is one atom of Aluminium (Al) in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative (summed) mass:**\n        *   Sum = (Total mass of D atoms) + (Total mass of Al atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Check:**\n    The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical riddle and arrive at the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O). The \"normal conditions\" melting point of regular water is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X and the Heavier Isotope:** Since a product of a subsequent reaction is heavy water (D₂O), the heavier isotope mentioned in the first clue must be deuterium (D or ²H). This implies that Substance X contains deuterium. The clue that \"X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points strongly to Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), a powerful and common reducing agent. Its \"very close analog\" containing the heavier isotope is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**. This is our Substance X. It is a powerful reducing agent known for its violent reactions, especially with water.\n\n3.  **Identify Liquid Y and Gas W:** Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce a gas W and a precipitate G. The most logical violent reaction for a metal hydride is with water. Given the context of deuterium, liquid Y is likely heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂ (deuterium gas). Let's check if it fits the description: \"a gas whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This matches the clue perfectly. Other common molecules like N₂, O₂, and CO₂ also have this property, but D₂ is the most logical product in this specific reaction.\n\n4.  **Identify Precipitate G:** In the reaction above, Lithium Deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but Aluminum Deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, would form a precipitate, analogous to Aluminum Hydroxide, Al(OH)₃. So, G is Al(OD)₃.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Decomposition of G:** The clue states that when precipitate G is heated, it releases B.\n    *   **Reaction:** Heating Aluminum Hydroxide causes it to decompose into aluminum oxide and water: 2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O.\n    *   Therefore, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n    *   This reaction releases **D₂O**, which we've identified as substance B. This confirms the entire reaction sequence.\n\n6.  **Verify the Final Clue:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent.\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). An example is pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH), which has three oxygen atoms.\n    *   LiAlH₄ (and by extension LiAlD₄) reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   The ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-), and the carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   So, pyruvic acid would be reduced to 1,2-propanediol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH). This resulting molecule contains exactly two oxygen atoms, satisfying the clue.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄), summing all instances.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D, atomic number 1).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The formula LiAlD₄ contains one atom of the heaviest element (Al) and four atoms of the lightest element (D).\n    *   We need the atomic mass of the specific isotopes: ²⁷Al and ²H (Deuterium).\n    *   Atomic mass of ²⁷Al ≈ 26.9815 u.\n    *   Atomic mass of ²H (Deuterium) ≈ 2.0141 u.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 × 26.9815 u = 26.9815 u\n        *   Total mass of the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 × 2.0141 u = 8.0564 u\n        *   Cumulative mass = 26.9815 + 8.0564 = 35.0379 u\n\n8.  **Final Answer:** The calculated cumulative atomic mass is approximately 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe user's query is a chemical puzzle that requires identifying a substance (X) and then performing a calculation based on its constituent elements. I have deduced the identity of substance X and confirmed all the related chemical reactions and properties through search queries. My initial hypothesis seems correct.\n\n**Here is a summary of the findings:**\n\n*   **Substance X:** The clues strongly point to Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope: Deuterium (D), an isotope of Hydrogen.\n    *   Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry, known for its violent reactions, especially with protic substances. LiAlD₄ shares these properties.\n*   **Melting Point of B:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C), which matches the clue precisely. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n*   **Reaction of X with Y:**\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W and form precipitate G.\n    *   If Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. This reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   **Gas W** is D₂ (dideuterium). A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the clue that the number of protons and neutrons is the same.\n    *   **Precipitate G** is Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃.\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) causes decomposition to Al₂O₃ and D₂O (substance B), which aligns with the clues.\n*   **Reaction with Keto Acid:** LiAlH₄ (and by extension LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. A keto acid contains both functional groups. For example, reducing pyruvic acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) would yield propane-1,2-diol, a product with 2 oxygen atoms, which matches the clue.\n*   **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in the substance.\n    *   The mass of the lightest element's instances in the molecule: There are four atoms of Deuterium (²H or D). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu. The total mass is 4 * 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   The mass of the heaviest element's instances in the molecule: There is one atom of Aluminium. The only stable isotope of Aluminium is Aluminium-27 (²⁷Al), which has an atomic mass of approximately 27 amu. The total mass is 1 * 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe logic holds, and the calculation is straightforward based on the identified substance. All clues are satisfied.\n\nFinal answer is 35, which corresponds to option D.\nI am ready to provide the final answer.\nBased on the detailed chemical puzzle provided, the substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). Here is a step-by-step deduction:\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The melting point of substance B is stated to be very close to 277 K (4°C). This is the characteristic melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K. This implies that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Identification of Substance X**: The problem states that substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Since X contains deuterium, its analog contains hydrogen. Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very powerful and common reducing agent, and its deuterated version, Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄), is also used for isotopic labeling. This makes LiAlD₄ a strong candidate for substance X.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Reaction**:\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y. Let's assume Y is heavy water (D₂O). The reaction is `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   A gas, W, is released whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. The gas produced is D₂. A deuterium nucleus has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description perfectly.\n    *   A precipitate, G, is formed. In the reaction, Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, would precipitate.\n    *   When G is heated, it releases B (D₂O). Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause it to decompose into Al₂O₃ and D₂O, which is consistent with the clues.\n\n4.  **Reaction with a Keto Acid**: LiAlH₄ (and therefore LiAlD₄) reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid into alcohol groups. For instance, pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH), which has three oxygen atoms, would be reduced to propane-1,2-diol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂(OH)), a product containing two oxygen atoms. This matches the problem's description.\n\n5.  **Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Masses**:\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (lightest metal), Aluminium (heaviest element), and Deuterium (isotope of the lightest element, Hydrogen).\n    *   The **lightest element** present is Hydrogen (represented by its isotope, Deuterium).\n    *   The **heaviest element** present is Aluminium.\n    *   The cumulative mass from the atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen) in the molecule is the sum of the masses of the four Deuterium atoms. The mass of one Deuterium (²H) atom is approximately 2 atomic mass units (amu).\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 amu = 8 amu.\n    *   The cumulative mass from the atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminium) in the molecule is the mass of the one Aluminium atom. The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass of approximately 27 amu.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 amu = 27 amu.\n    *   The cumulative atomic mass is the sum of these values: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (~4 °C). The normal melting point of water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C), but heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), has a melting point of 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This strongly suggests that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X and its Reactions:**\n    *   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope. The identity of B as D₂O implies this isotope is deuterium.\n    *   A close analog of X is a common reagent in organic chemistry. This points to reagents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). The deuterated analog would be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n    *   X reacts violently with a liquid Y to release a gas W and form a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is known to be violent. Let's assume **X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Heating precipitate G releases B (D₂O). The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (Y = D₂O) would be:\n        `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n        This reaction is violent.\n    *   The precipitate **G** would be a mix of Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Heating aluminum hydroxide (or deuteroxide) causes it to decompose and release water (or heavy water). `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This matches the observation that heating G releases B.\n    *   The gas **W** released is deuterium gas (D₂). A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description that it \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   The final clue is that the product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to hydroxyl groups (-OH), resulting in a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n    *   The instruction specifies summing the masses of all instances of these elements in the molecule.\n\n    *   **Mass of the Lightest Element (Hydrogen):**\n        There are four atoms of the deuterium isotope (D) in the molecule.\n        The mass number of a single deuterium atom is 2 (1 proton + 1 neutron). Its atomic mass is approximately 2.014 amu.\n        Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n\n    *   **Mass of the Heaviest Element (Aluminum):**\n        There is one atom of Aluminum (Al) in the molecule.\n        The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27. Its atomic mass is approximately 26.98 amu.\n        Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:**\n        Sum = (Total mass of lightest element) + (Total mass of heaviest element)\n        Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances and Reactions:**\n    *   **Clue 6:** \"The melting point of B ... is very close to 277 K.\" 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is an extremely strong hint that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 5:** \"...a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\" This means that heating the precipitate G produces D₂O. This is characteristic of heating a deuterated metal hydroxide (e.g., M(OD)n → MOx + D₂O) or a salt containing heavy water of crystallization (Salt·xD₂O → Salt + xD₂O). For this to happen, D₂O must be involved in the initial reaction.\n    *   **Connecting Clues:** Since D₂O is a key component, it's highly probable that **liquid Y is D₂O**. The problem states that substance X reacts violently with liquid Y.\n    *   **Clues 7 & 8:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" These clues point towards a reducing agent used in organic synthesis. Keto acids (R-CO-COOH) have two reducible groups: a ketone and a carboxylic acid. Strong reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) can reduce both, yielding a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ is a staple reagent, fitting the description. The mention of a \"heavier isotope\" (Clue 1) leads us to its deuterated analog: **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Confirming with all clues:** Let's test the hypothesis that **X = LiAlD₄** and **Y = D₂O**.\n        *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑\n        *   **Clue 1 (Heavy Isotope):** X (LiAlD₄) contains Deuterium (D). ✓\n        *   **Clue 2 (Violent Reaction):** The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is notoriously violent; the reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O would be similarly violent. ✓\n        *   **Clue 3 (Gas W):** The gas released is D₂ (Deuterium gas). A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. The number of neutrons and protons is the same. ✓\n        *   **Clue 4 (Precipitate G):** Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is formed, which is insoluble and precipitates from the solution. ✓\n        *   **Clue 5 & 6 (G and B):** When precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. The released substance B is D₂O, whose melting point is indeed ~277 K. ✓\n    *   All clues are consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest and heaviest elements** present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula unit. We should use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved (D = ²H, and Al is naturally ~100% ²⁷Al).\n    *   Mass of Deuterium (D) ≈ 2 amu.\n    *   Mass of Aluminum (Al) ≈ 27 amu.\n    *   There are **four** Deuterium atoms in LiAlD₄. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   There is **one** Aluminum atom in LiAlD₄. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Total mass of D atoms) + (Total mass of Al atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35 amu.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify substance X and calculate the required atomic masses:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the characteristic melting point of heavy water (D₂O).\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W, released during the reaction, has an equal number of neutrons and protons. A common gas produced in reactions with deuterated compounds is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description.\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** The information points towards a deuterated reducing agent commonly used in organic chemistry. The close analog being a very common reagent suggests either sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) or lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Consequently, substance X is likely sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄) or lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). The reduction of a keto acid to a product containing two oxygen atoms is consistent with the action of these reagents.\n4.  **Confirming Substance X:** The reaction of X with a liquid Y is violent and produces a precipitate G, which upon heating releases heavy water (B). If we consider X to be LiAlD₄ and Y to be an acid like DCl, the reaction would be LiAlD₄ + 4DCl → LiCl + AlCl₃ + 4D₂. The gas produced is D₂ (W). Aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) can form a hydrate, or in this context, a \"deuterate\" like [Al(D₂O)₆]Cl₃, which would be the precipitate G. Heating this deuterate would release heavy water, D₂O (B). This sequence of reactions aligns perfectly with all the clues. LiAlD₄ is a more potent reducing agent than NaBD₄ and is known for its violent reactions.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nBased on the analysis, substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n*   The lightest element is Hydrogen, present as its heavier isotope, Deuterium (D).\n*   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al).\n*   The chemical formula is LiAlD₄. There are four atoms of the lightest element (D) and one atom of the heaviest element (Al).\n\nNow, we calculate the cumulative atomic masses:\n\n*   The atomic mass of one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminum (Al), is approximately 27 amu.\n*   The atomic mass of one atom of the lightest element's heavy isotope, Deuterium (D), is approximately 2 amu.\n*   The sum of the masses of all the heavier isotopes (one Aluminum atom) is 1 x 27 = 27 amu.\n*   The sum of the masses of all the lighter isotopes (four Deuterium atoms) is 4 x 2 = 8 amu.\n*   The cumulative atomic mass is the sum of these two values: 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is ~277 K (4°C). This is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82°C (276.97 K). The heavier isotope mentioned in the prompt is likely Deuterium (D), the isotope of Hydrogen. So, B is D₂O.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance G:** G is a precipitate that releases B (D₂O) upon heating. This suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide, likely Al(OD)₃, which upon heating decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance Y and Gas W:** The reaction of X and Y produces a precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) and a gas W. The reaction is violent, typical of a strong reducing agent with a protic solvent. For the product to be Al(OD)₃, the reactants must contain Al and D. Y is the source of the OD group, so Y is likely D₂O (liquid heavy water).\n    The reaction would be: X + D₂O → Al(OD)₃ + ...\n    Gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's test D₂ gas (Deuterium gas). Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** Based on the above, X is a powerful reducing agent containing Aluminum and Deuterium. The reaction with a keto acid producing a product with 2 oxygens (reduction of both keto and carboxylic acid groups) points strongly to a reagent like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Since the substance contains Deuterium, it must be the deuterated analog: Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   Let's check the reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W). This reaction is consistent with all the clues.\n    *   The \"close analog\" used in organic chemistry is LiAlH₄.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Value:**\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   The atomic mass numbers for the relevant isotopes are: D ≈ 2, Li ≈ 7, Al ≈ 27.\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (D).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The problem asks for the sum of the masses of *all instances* of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   In LiAlD₄, there are four atoms of the lightest element (D). Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   There is one atom of the heaviest element (Al). Total mass = 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative mass = (mass of all D atoms) + (mass of all Al atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B. Now, we'll implement this calculation in Python.\n\n```python\n# Based on the chemical puzzle, Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D), an isotope of Hydrogen.\n\n# Atomic mass numbers of the relevant isotopes:\n# Deuterium (D) is the lightest element present.

Powerful reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) fit this description. Their \"close analogs\" incorporating a heavier isotope would be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n*   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\": A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Both functional groups are reduced by strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄. The ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The resulting molecule is a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. This strongly supports X being a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄. NaBH₄ is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction of X with Y.**\n*   \"X... reacts violently with liquid Y\": LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water and other protic solvents. This supports the identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n*   \"with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\": Let's analyze potential small gas molecules (W) where the number of protons (p⁺) equals the number of neutrons (n⁰). We use the most common isotopes unless specified.\n    *   H₂: 2 p⁺, 0 n⁰\n    *   He: 2 p⁺, 2 n⁰ (Inert, unlikely product of a violent reaction)\n    *   **D₂ (²H₂)**: 2 p⁺, 2 n⁰. This fits perfectly and is consistent with X containing Deuterium.\n    *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 p⁺, 14 n⁰. Plausible, but less connected to the other clues.\n    *   ¹²C¹⁶O: 14 p⁺, 14 n⁰. Plausible, but less connected.\n    *   CD₄: 10 p⁺, 10 n⁰. Plausible, but formation from a keto acid reaction isn't direct.\n    Given that X contains deuterium, the most likely gas W is D₂. For LiAlD₄ to produce D₂ gas, it must react with a source of deuterium. The most common liquid that is a source of deuterium is heavy water, D₂O.\n*   So, we can deduce: **X = LiAlD₄** and **Y = D₂O**.\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is violent, releases D₂ gas (W), and involves the deuterated reagent X.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the precipitate G and substance B.**\n*   \"a precipitate G forms\": In the reaction above, Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is insoluble and will form a precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n*   \"which, when heated, releases B\": Hydroxides and deuteroxides decompose upon heating to form an oxide and water.\n    *   Decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n    *   The substance released (B) is heavy water, D₂O. So, **B = D₂O**.\n*   \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\": The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). 276.97 K is indeed very close to 277 K. This confirms all our deductions.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   Substance X has been identified as **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   The lightest element (by atomic number) is Hydrogen. The isotope present is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n*   The heaviest element (by atomic number) is Aluminum (Al). The stable isotope is ²⁷Al.\n*   The calculation requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements found in the formula unit.\n    *   **Mass of Hydrogen isotopes**: There are four atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass of one D atom is approximately 2 amu.\n      Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass of Aluminum isotopes**: There is one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass of one ²⁷Al atom is 27 amu.\n      Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative (total) sum**:\n    Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum)\n    Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n**Detailed Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B:** The melting point of Substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". This is 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), containing the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is an excellent match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identification of the Heavier Isotope:** The presence of D₂O confirms that the heavier isotope mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n3.  **Identification of Gas W:** The gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze D₂, a gas that would logically be formed in a system containing Deuterium. A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has (1+1) = 2 protons and (1+1) = 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. **W is D₂ gas**.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the Reaction:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases D₂O (Substance B).\n    *   This is a classic reaction of a highly reactive metal deuteride with heavy water. The general form is: `Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuterated Hydroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`.\n    *   The precipitate G is a deuterated hydroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which upon heating decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O. `2M(OD)ₓ → M₂Oₓ + x D₂O`.\n    *   This confirms that **Y is D₂O**.\n\n5.  **Identification of Substance X:**\n    *   Clue: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards common hydride/deuteride reducing agents. The most prominent are sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Substance X is likely the deuterated version of one of these, i.e., NaBD₄ or LiAlD₄.\n    *   Clue: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., an α-keto acid R-CO-COOH) contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group, and has 3 oxygen atoms. A powerful reducing agent like LiAlH₄ (or its analog, X = LiAlD₄) can reduce both functional groups: the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid becomes a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The final product, a diol like R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH), contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. A milder reagent like NaBH₄ would not reduce the carboxylic acid.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminum.\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄. We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's atoms: There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of D is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element's atoms: There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the most common isotope is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nBased on the detailed chemical puzzle, the cumulative atomic mass is calculated to be 35.\n\n**Here is the step-by-step derivation:**\n\n*   **Substance B:** The melting point is very close to 277 K (which is 3.85 °C). This corresponds to the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n*   **Liquid Y:** Since the reaction with X produces deuterated compounds, Y is also **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Deuterium gas (**D₂**) fits this description perfectly. A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   **Substance X:** This substance reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. Its \"very close analog\" is a common reagent in organic chemistry. Furthermore, it reduces a keto acid to a product with two oxygen atoms. These clues strongly point to **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Violent Reaction:** LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water, including heavy water.\n    *   **Organic Reagent Analog:** Its analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a very powerful and common reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n    *   **Keto Acid Reaction:** LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is strong enough to reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH). This transforms the acid, which has three oxygen atoms, into a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which has only two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Precipitate G:** The reaction of LiAlD₄ with excess D₂O produces soluble lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and a precipitate, **aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**.\n*   **Heating G:** When aluminum deuteroxide (or hydroxide) is heated, it decomposes and releases heavy water (D₂O), which is substance B.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nThe problem asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n1.  **Elements in X:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n2.  **Lightest Element:** The element with the lowest atomic number is Hydrogen, present as its isotope Deuterium (D). There are **four** Deuterium atoms.\n3.  **Heaviest Element:** The element with the highest atomic number is Aluminum (Al). There is **one** Aluminum atom.\n4.  **Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The mass of an Aluminum (²⁷Al) atom is approximately **27** amu.\n    *   The mass of a Deuterium (²H) atom is approximately **2** amu.\n5.  **Cumulative Mass Calculation:**\n    *   Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   Total mass of the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   Cumulative sum = 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThe provided information confirms the deductions made during the thinking process.\n\n*   **Substance X and its reactions:** Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) is a potent reducing agent used for deuterium labeling. It is the deuterated analog of the very common reagent lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water, and by extension, LiAlD₄ would react violently with heavy water (D₂O). The reaction of LiAlH₄ with H₂O produces LiOH, Al(OH)₃, and H₂ gas. By analogy, reacting LiAlD₄ with D₂O would produce LiOD, Al(OD)₃, and D₂ gas. Gas W, D₂, has one proton and one neutron per atom, meaning the molecule D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description of having an equal number.\n*   **Precipitate G and substance B:** The precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, analogous to aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃. When heated, aluminum hydroxide decomposes, releasing water. Therefore, Al(OD)₃ will decompose to release heavy water (D₂O), which is substance B.\n*   **Melting point of B:** The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. To convert this to Kelvin, we add 273.15. So, 3.82 + 273.15 = 276.97 K. This value is \"very close to 277 K\", confirming the identity of B.\n*   **Keto acid reaction:** LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing carboxylic acids and esters to primary alcohols. Therefore, it can reduce an α-keto acid (which contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group) to a diol, which would contain two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The lightest element in LiAlD₄ is hydrogen (atomic number 1), present as its heavier isotope deuterium (D). The atomic mass of deuterium is approximately 2.014 amu. For the calculation, we will use the mass number 2.\n    *   The heaviest element in LiAlD₄ is aluminum (atomic number 13). Its only stable isotope is aluminum-27. The atomic mass is approximately 26.98 amu. For the calculation, we will use the mass number 27.\n\n**Calculation**\n\nBased on the confirmed identity of Substance X as LiAlD₄, the elements and their cumulative masses are as follows:\n\n1.  **Lightest element:** Hydrogen, present as 4 atoms of Deuterium (²H or D).\n    *   Cumulative mass of the lightest element = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n2.  **Heaviest element:** Aluminum, present as 1 atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al).\n    *   Cumulative mass of the heaviest element = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is the sum of these values:\nTotal mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substance X**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"**\n        This immediately suggests that Substance X contains an element with a common, stable heavy isotope. The most frequent examples in chemistry are Deuterium (D or ²H), which is a heavy isotope of Hydrogen, and Carbon-13 (¹³C).\n\n    *   **Clue 2: \"...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**\n        A violent reaction suggests a highly reactive substance, such as a strong reducing agent or a reactive metal hydride. Let's examine potential gases (W) where the total number of protons (p) equals the total number of neutrons (n):\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** A molecule of D₂ consists of two Deuterium atoms (²H). Each has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Total: p=2, n=2. This fits the criterion and strongly supports the idea that X is a deuterated compound.\n        *   **¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas):** Each nitrogen atom has 7p and 7n. Total: p=14, n=14. This fits, but it's harder to connect to the other clues.\n        *   **CD₄ (Deuteromethane):** Composed of ¹²C (6p, 6n) and four D atoms (1p, 1n each). Total: p = 6 + 4(1) = 10; n = 6 + 4(1) = 10. This is also a possibility.\n        Let's proceed with the D₂ hypothesis as it is the simplest and most direct consequence of a deuterated substance reacting. For a reaction to release pure D₂ gas, a deuteride (Substance X) would need to react with a deuterated solvent (Liquid Y), like heavy water (D₂O).\n\n    *   **Let's form a hypothesis:**\n        *   Substance X is a deuteride salt. A very common one is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n        *   Liquid Y is heavy water, **D₂O**.\n        *   Gas W is **D₂**.\n        *   The reaction would be: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n        This reaction is violent, produces D₂ gas (p=n), and forms a precipitate, Aluminum Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). This fits perfectly so far.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: \"...a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        From our hypothesis, the precipitate G is **Al(OD)₃**. When metal hydroxides (or deuteroxides) are heated, they decompose to form the metal oxide and water (or heavy water).\n        *   Reaction: `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n        *   So, substance B is **D₂O**.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This value is indeed \"very close to 277 K\". This provides strong confirmation for our hypothesis.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent. A keto acid possesses two functional groups that can be reduced: a ketone (`-C=O`) and a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). LiAlD₄ reduces a ketone to a secondary alcohol (`-CD(OH)-`) and a carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (`-CD₂(OH)`). Therefore, the reaction product would be a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This clue is also satisfied.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**\n        LiAlD₄ (Substance X) is used in organic synthesis, particularly for isotopic labeling. Its \"very close analog\" is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (**LiAlH₄**), which is one of the most common and powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. This clue fits perfectly.\n\n2.  **Conclusion on Identity**\n    All clues consistently point to Substance X being **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in LiAlD₄.\n\n    *   **Elements present:**\n        *   Lithium (Li), Atomic number Z=3\n        *   Aluminum (Al), Atomic number Z=13\n        *   Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D), Atomic number Z=1\n    *   **Lightest and Heaviest:**\n        *   Lightest element (by Z) is Hydrogen.\n        *   Heaviest element (by Z) is Aluminum.\n    *   **Mass Calculation:** We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes present.\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D), which is ²H. Mass number = 2.\n        *   The most abundant isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al. Mass number = 27.\n        *   The formula is LiAlD₄. There is 1 atom of Aluminum and 4 atoms of Deuterium.\n    *   **Summation:**\n        *   Total mass from heaviest element (Aluminum) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n        *   Total mass from lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Cumulative mass = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Gas W**\n        The gas W released has a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine simple molecules:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen gas): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Deuterium (D or ²H) is an isotope of hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect match.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Possible, but less likely in this reaction context.\n        *   D₂ is the most plausible candidate for W, especially given the next clue.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance B**\n        Precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is ~277 K.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n        *   This value is \"very close to 277 K\". Therefore, B is heavy water, D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: The Reaction**\n        *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G.\n        *   Since heating G produces B (D₂O), G is likely a metal deuteroxide (a metal hydroxide with D instead of H). Example: M(OD)n.\n        *   The production of D₂ gas strongly suggests that both the reagent (X) and the liquid it reacts with (Y) are sources of deuterium. If X were a deuteride and Y were normal water (H₂O), the product would be HD gas, not D₂.\n        *   Therefore, the reaction is likely: `Deuterated Reagent (X) + Heavy Water (Y=D₂O) -> Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ gas (W)`. The violent nature of the reaction points towards X being a highly reactive deuterated compound, like a metal deuteride or a complex metal deuteride.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Substance X and its use**\n        *   X contains a heavier isotope (we've established this is Deuterium).\n        *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This strongly suggests a common reagent pair like LiAlH₄ / LiAlD₄ or NaBH₄ / NaBD₄.\n        *   Let's test the most likely candidate: X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride). Its analog is LiAlH₄ (Lithium Aluminium Hydride), an extremely common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n        *   Let's see if X = LiAlD₄ fits the reaction:\n            `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n        *   This reaction is known to be violent. Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate (G). The gas produced is D₂ (W). This fits perfectly.\n        *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause decomposition: `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`. This correctly produces B (D₂O).\n\n    *   **Clue 5: The Keto Acid Reaction**\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has two functional groups: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both groups to alcohols.\n        *   Ketone (>C=O) → Secondary alcohol (>CD-OH)\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) → Primary alcohol (-CD₂OH)\n        *   So, a keto acid like R-C(=O)-R'-COOH is reduced to a diol: R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH.\n        *   The final product is a diol, which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms that X is LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\n\n    *   We have identified Substance X as **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements present in X. We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Comparing the elements:\n        *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1)\n        *   Middle element: Lithium (Atomic Number 3)\n        *   Heaviest element: Aluminium (Atomic Number 13)\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all Hydrogen (Deuterium) atoms and all Aluminium atoms. For this calculation, we use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n        *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n          Total mass from Hydrogen atoms = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium. The most common and stable isotope is ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27.\n          Total mass from Aluminium atoms = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass** = (Total mass from lightest element) + (Total mass from heaviest element)\n        Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nBased on the detailed step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Substance B**, with a melting point near 277 K (3.85 °C), is identified as **heavy water (D₂O)**, which melts at 3.82 °C. This reveals the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D)**.\n2.  **Substance X** reacts violently with a liquid **Y** (identified as D₂O) to produce a gas **W** and a precipitate **G**.\n3.  The precipitate **G**, upon heating, releases B (D₂O), which is characteristic of a metal deuteroxide decomposing. Thus, **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n4.  The gas **W** has an equal number of protons and neutrons. The reaction between a metal deuteride and D₂O produces Deuterium gas (D₂). A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the description. So, **W is D₂**.\n5.  **Substance X** and its analog are common reagents in organic chemistry. This clue, combined with its nature as a reactive metal deuteride, points towards Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (**LiAlD₄**), whose analog is the common reducing agent LiAlH₄.\n6.  The final clue confirms this: the reaction of a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) with X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid into a diol, a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms **X is LiAlD₄**.\n7.  The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   Using their integer mass numbers: Li=7, Al=27, D=2.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum (Al)** with a mass of 27.\n    *   The lightest element is **Deuterium (D)** with a mass of 2.\n    *   The formula LiAlD₄ contains one atom of the heaviest element (Al) and four atoms of the lightest element (D).\n    *   The cumulative mass is the sum of the masses of all these atoms: (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue 6: \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        *   277 Kelvin is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   This temperature is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   However, it is extremely close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C.\n        *   Therefore, substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n    *   **Clue 1 & 5: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope...\" and \"when heated, [precipitate G] releases B.\"**\n        *   Since B is D₂O, the precipitate G must contain deuterium (D). G decomposes upon heating to release D₂O, which is a characteristic property of a metal deuteroxide (similar to how a metal hydroxide decomposes into a metal oxide and water). So, G is likely a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ.\n        *   Since G is formed from the reaction of X and Y, the deuterium must originate from one or both of these reactants. Clue 1 states X contains a heavier isotope, which strongly suggests **Substance X contains Deuterium (D)**.\n\n    *   **Clue 8: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**\n        *   This points towards common deuterated reagents. The most common analogs are powerful reducing agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n        *   This suggests that substance X could be Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄) or Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n    *   **Clue 2, 3, 4: Reaction of X with Y**\n        *   The reaction is violent (clue 2), releases a gas W (clue 3), and forms a precipitate G (clue 4).\n        *   Crucially, gas W's molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's test some possibilities:\n            *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n            *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1). (Yes)**\n            *   N₂ (as ¹⁴N₂): 14 protons (7+7), 14 neutrons (7+7). (Yes)\n            *   CO (as ¹²C¹⁶O): 14 protons (6+8), 14 neutrons (6+8). (Yes)\n        *   Let's test the hypothesis that **X = LiAlD₄**. LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water. So let's assume Y is a form of water. The reaction must produce D₂ gas.\n        *   Let's test the reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (s) + 4D₂ (g)`\n        *   Let's check if this fits the clues:\n            *   **Liquid Y = D₂O** (heavy water). This is consistent.\n            *   **Gas W = D₂**. As shown above, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n            *   **Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃** (Aluminium deuteroxide). This is a solid precipitate. This fits.\n            *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) gives aluminum oxide and heavy water: `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. The released substance is D₂O, which we identified as B. This fits perfectly.\n        *   The alternative, `LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O -> LiOH + Al(OH)₃(s) + 4HD(g)`, would produce HD gas, which has 2 protons and 1 neutron, so this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Clue 7: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group (e.g., Pyruvic acid: CH₃-C(=O)-COOH), and thus has 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols.\n        *   `R-C(=O)-COOH --(LiAlD₄/H₂O workup)--> R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH)`\n        *   The product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups, -OH). It contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms that X is a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".

The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Mass from H (as D) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from H) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Final Answer Selection**\n\n    *   The calculated cumulative mass is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\nA computational check is not necessary for this simple arithmetic.\nFinal verification of the steps and interpretation confirms the result.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe provided information confirms the key points used in the logical deduction.\n\n*   **Substance B and Y:** The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (~3.82 °C), which is very close to the 277 K given in the prompt. This confirms the identity of B as D₂O. The violent reaction of X with a liquid to produce deuterated products (G and W) strongly implies the liquid Y is also D₂O.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The reaction of metal deuterides with D₂O produces D₂ gas. D₂ (deuterium gas) is a molecule where the number of protons (2) equals the number of neutrons (2), fitting the description of gas W.\n\n*   **Precipitate G:** The reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O would produce LiOD and Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate, which would make the deuterated version, Al(OD)₃, a precipitate as well. Heating a metal deuteroxide like Al(OD)₃ would release D₂O, which is substance B.\n\n*   **Substance X:** The logic pointed to Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). The search results confirm that its close analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a powerful and common reducing agent in organic chemistry. Crucially, LiAlH₄ is capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. Therefore, its reaction with an α-keto acid (R-CO-COOH), which contains a ketone and a carboxylic acid group, would reduce both to produce a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This resulting diol contains exactly two oxygen atoms, perfectly matching the final clue in the problem statement. The less potent reducing agent, NaBH₄, is generally not reactive enough to reduce carboxylic acids, making LiAlD₄ the correct choice for X.\n\nThe logical deduction that substance X is LiAlD₄ is well-supported.\n\nThe final step is the calculation:\n*   **Substance X:** Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as its heavier isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (by atomic number).\n*   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (by atomic number).\n*   **Instruction:** Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements. \"If multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... isotopes must be summed.\"\n*   **Mass of the lightest element's atoms (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of Deuterium (²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu. Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8 amu.\n*   **Mass of the heaviest element's atoms (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al). The mass is approximately 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative mass:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n### Unraveling the Chemical Puzzle\n\nBased on the series of clues provided, the unknown substances and reactions can be identified through a step-by-step deduction:\n\n1.  **Identifying Substance B and Gas W:** The melting point of substance B is stated to be very close to 277 K (3.85°C). This is the characteristic melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction also releases a gas W whose molecules contain an equal number of neutrons and protons. A strong candidate for this gas is **deuterium gas (D₂)**. Each deuterium atom has one proton and one neutron, so a D₂ molecule has two protons and two neutrons.\n\n2.  **Identifying Substance X:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields D₂O. This suggests a powerful reducing agent that contains deuterium. A well-known class of reagents in organic chemistry that fits this description is metal hydrides. The most common analog mentioned is **lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Therefore, Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope, is **lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. The clue about the reaction with a keto acid producing a compound with two oxygen atoms aligns with the known reactivity of LiAlH₄, which reduces the keto group but not the carboxylic acid group.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Reaction:** The violent reaction can be deduced as the reaction between LiAlD₄ (Substance X) and D₂O (Liquid Y).\n    *   **Reaction:** `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent, analogous to the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water.\n    *   It produces deuterium gas (W).\n    *   It forms a precipitate G, which is aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (and lithium deuteroxide, LiOD). Aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) causes it to decompose, releasing heavy water B (D₂O). The corresponding reaction for aluminum hydroxide is `2 Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 H₂O`.\n\n### Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Masses\n\nThe final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** By atomic number, the lightest element is **Hydrogen** (Z=1) and the heaviest element is **Aluminum** (Z=13). Lithium (Z=3) is in between.\n*   **Mass Contribution:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses, considering all instances of these elements in the molecule. For simplicity and as the options are integers, we will use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The stable isotope is Al-27.\n        *   Mass contribution from Al = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** The isotope present is Deuterium (D), and there are four atoms. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Mass contribution from D = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** The sum of these masses is:\n    *   27 (from Aluminum) + 8 (from Deuterium) = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe detailed chemical puzzle can be solved step-by-step to identify the substances involved and perform the required calculation.\n\n*   **Identifying Substance B:** The melting point of Substance B is stated to be very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the characteristic melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K.\n*   **Identifying the Heavier Isotope:** Since B is heavy water, the heavier isotope incorporated in Substance X must be deuterium (D or ²H), which is a stable isotope of hydrogen containing one proton and one neutron.\n*   **Identifying Substance X:** The clue that Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry, particularly for reactions with keto acids, points towards a powerful reducing agent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common reagent of this type. Its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits the description of containing a heavy isotope.\n*   **Confirming the Reactions:**\n    *   **Reaction of X with Y:** The violent reaction described is consistent with the reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O). Let's assume liquid Y is D₂O. The reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is known to be vigorous.\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas released is D₂. A molecule of D₂ contains two protons (one from each deuterium atom) and two neutrons (one from each deuterium atom), satisfying the condition that the number of protons and neutrons are equal.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** In the reaction above, Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is formed as a precipitate.\n    *   **Formation of B from G:** When heated, aluminum hydroxide (and its deuterated analog) decomposes. The reaction is 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This confirms that heating precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) releases substance B (D₂O).\n\n*   **Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (as Deuterium).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum.\n    *   The question requires summing the atomic masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula.\n    *   The formula LiAlD₄ contains one atom of Aluminum and four atoms of Deuterium.\n    *   The mass of the stable isotope of Aluminum, ²⁷Al, is approximately 26.98 amu.\n    *   The mass of the Deuterium isotope, ²H, is approximately 2.014 amu.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass of 1 × ²⁷Al) + (Mass of 4 × ²H)\n    *   Cumulative Mass ≈ 27 + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe sum of the atomic masses is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
