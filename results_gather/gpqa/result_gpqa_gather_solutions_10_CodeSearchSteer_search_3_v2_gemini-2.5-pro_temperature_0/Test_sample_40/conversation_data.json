Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame where the observer is located.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame, which is the piece of glass itself. It moves with a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the glass relative to the lab (v):** The glass (frame S') is moving at velocity `v` in the same direction as the light beam, relative to the observer (frame S).\n    *   **Velocity of light relative to the glass (u'):** In its own rest frame (S'), the speed of light in the glass is determined by its index of refraction, `n`. The speed is `c/n`. Since the problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`. This velocity is in the same direction as `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of light relative to the lab (u):** This is the quantity we need to find. It is the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame S.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities in the same direction in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We substitute `u' = 1/n`, `v = v`, and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe initial analysis based on the relativistic velocity-addition formula is confirmed by the search results.\n\n*   **The Problem:** We need to find the speed of light (`u`) in a moving medium (glass) as seen by a stationary observer (in the laboratory).\n*   **Frame S (Laboratory):** The observer is at rest. The glass is moving with velocity `v`.\n*   **Frame S' (Glass):** The glass is at rest. The speed of light within the glass is `u'`.\n*   **Speed of light in the medium's rest frame (S'):** The index of refraction `n` is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). Given `c=1`, we have `n = 1 / u'`, which means `u' = 1/n`.\n*   **Relativistic Velocity-Addition Formula:** For collinear motion, the formula to find the velocity `u` in frame S, given the velocity `u'` in frame S' and the relative velocity `v` between the frames, is `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`. This formula is the correct one to use, as opposed to the simple classical addition of velocities. This specific application to light in a moving medium is a classic example known as the Fizeau experiment.\n*   **Applying the values:**\n    *   `u'` = 1/n\n    *   `v` = v\n    *   `c` = 1\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2)`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n*   **Simplifying the expression:** To clear the fractions within the main fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option C.

The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). The problem states that `c=1`, so `n = c / u' = 1 / u'`.

Identify the Frames of Reference**\n\nWe need to consider two different inertial frames of reference:\n*   **S' (The Rest Frame of the Glass):** In this frame, the glass is stationary. An observer in this frame would be moving along with the glass.\n*   **S (The Laboratory Frame):** In this frame, the laboratory and the observer are stationary. The glass is observed to be moving with a constant velocity `v`.\n\n**2. Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (S')**\n\n*   The definition of the index of refraction `n` of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in that medium (`u'`).\n*   So, `n = c / u'`.\n*   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c = 1`.\n*   Therefore, the speed of the light beam within the glass, as measured in the glass's own rest frame (S'), is `u' = c / n = 1 / n`.\n*   This velocity `u'` is in the same direction as the motion of the glass.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n\n*   We need to find the speed of the light beam (`u`) as measured in the laboratory frame (S). To do this, we must use the Einstein velocity addition formula, as the speeds involved can be close to the speed of light. The classical Galilean addition (`u = u' + v`) is not accurate.\n*   The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the laboratory frame (S). This is what we want to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the moving frame (S', the glass).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (S', the glass) relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n\n**4. Substitute the Known Values into the Formula**\n\n*   We have `u' = 1/n`.\n*   We have the velocity of the glass `v`.\n*   We have the speed of light in vacuum `c = 1`.\n\nSubstituting these into the velocity addition formula:\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n**5. Simplify the Expression**\n\n*   First, simplify the denominator:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n*   To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator.\n    *   Numerator: `1/n + v = 1/n + nv/n = (1 + nv) / n`\n    *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = n/n + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n*   Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n    `u = ( (1 + nv) / n ) / ( (n + v) / n )`\n*   The `n` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out:\n    `u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)`\n\n**6.

The problem involves the speed of light, which is the domain of special relativity.\n*   **Frame Identification:** Correctly identifying which speed belongs to which frame of reference (`u'` in the glass's frame, `v` for the glass's motion, `u` in the lab frame) is the key to setting up the problem correctly.\n*   **Sign Convention:** Since the light beam and the glass are moving in the same direction, both `u'` and `v` are positive. If they were moving in opposite directions, one would be negative.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** Be careful when simplifying the complex fraction to arrive at the final form. Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the main fraction by `n` is an efficient way to simplify.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame where the observer is located.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame that is at rest with respect to the glass.

We want to find the speed of light in this frame. Let's denote this speed by *u*.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference that is moving along with the glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the stationary frame (S):** The glass is moving at a velocity *v* relative to the laboratory. So, the velocity of frame S' with respect to frame S is *v*.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam in the moving frame (S'):** In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of light is determined by the index of refraction, *n*. The speed of light in a medium is given by *c/n*. Since the problem states to take the speed of light in vacuum *c=1*, the speed of the light beam as measured in the glass frame (S') is *u' = 1/n*.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam in the laboratory frame (S):** This is the unknown quantity we need to find, which we have denoted as *u*.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Principle:**\n    In classical physics (Galilean relativity), we would simply add the velocities: *u = u' + v = 1/n + v*. However, for speeds approaching the speed of light, we must use Einstein's theory of special relativity. The correct formula is the **relativistic velocity addition formula**.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    *u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)*\n\n5.  **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**\n    We have the following values:\n    *   *u'* = 1/n (speed of light in the glass's rest frame)\n    *   *v* = v (speed of the glass relative to the lab)\n    *   *c* = 1 (speed of light in vacuum)\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    *u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )*\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )*\n\n    To simplify this complex fraction, we can find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator, or we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by *n*. Let's use the latter method as it's more direct.\n\n    *u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / ( n * ( 1 + v/n ) )*\n\n    Distribute *n* in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    *   Numerator: n * (1/n) + n * v = 1 + n*v\n    *   Denominator: n * 1 + n * (v/n) = n + v\n\n    So, the simplified expression for *u* is:\n    *u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)*\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativity is Key:** The problem involves speeds that can be a significant fraction of the speed of light (since light is involved), so relativistic effects cannot be ignored. Using the Galilean addition *u = u' + v* would be incorrect.\n*   **Speed of Light in a Medium:** A common mistake is to assume the speed of light is always *c* (or 1 in this case). The second postulate of special relativity states that the speed of light *in a vacuum* is *c* for all inertial observers. The speed of light *in a medium* is *c/n* only in the rest frame of that medium.\n*   **Frame Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify which velocity belongs to which frame of reference. *u'* is the speed in the moving frame (S'), and *u* is the speed in the stationary lab frame (S).\n*   **Direction of Motion:** The problem states that the glass and the light beam move in the *same direction*. This is why we use the '+' sign in the numerator of the velocity addition formula, *(u' + v)*. If they were in opposite directions, we would use a '-' sign.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation Summary\n\n1.  Speed of light in the rest frame of the glass: *u' = c/n = 1/n*.\n2.

The observer is in this frame.\n    *   Let the frame of the moving glass be the moving frame, which we'll call **S'**. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is given as **v**.\n    *   The speed of light inside the glass is determined by its index of refraction, `n`. The speed of light in a medium at rest with refractive index `n` is `c/n`. In the S' frame (where the glass is at rest), the speed of the light beam is **u' = c/n**. The problem states that `c=1`, so **u' = 1/n**. Since the beam propagates in the same direction as the glass is moving, `u'` is positive.\n    *   We need to find the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (frame S). Let's call this velocity **u**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The problem involves adding velocities at speeds that can be comparable to the speed of light, so we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula. For velocities in the same direction, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We substitute the values we have into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Now, we simplify the algebraic expression for `u`:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To clear the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n    Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    This matches option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThis problem requires the application of Einstein's velocity-addition formula.

According to the definition of the index of refraction (*n*), this speed is *u' = c/n*.\n    *   The problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum, *c*, as 1. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass, relative to the glass, is *u' = 1/n*.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity-addition formula.**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    *u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c²)*\n    Here, *u* is the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S).\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula.**\n    *   *u'* = 1/n\n    *   *v* = v\n    *   *c* = 1\n\n    This gives:\n    *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1²)*\n    *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)*\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and the denominator, multiply both by *n*:\n    *u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)*\n    *u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)*\n\nThis result corresponds to the formula derived by Max von Laue in 1907, which provided a theoretical explanation for the results of the Fizeau experiment using special relativity. The Fizeau experiment, conducted in 1851, was a key piece of evidence that shaped Einstein's thinking on the matter.

The application of the relativistic velocity addition formula is the correct approach for this problem.

The formula shows that the speed of light in a moving medium is not a simple sum of the speed in the medium and the medium's velocity.To determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to an observer in the laboratory, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the velocities:**\n    *   Let the laboratory frame be the stationary frame S.\n    *   Let the moving glass be the moving frame S'.

The Galilean addition (`u = u' + v = 1/n + v`) would be an incorrect approximation.\n*   **Signs of Velocities:** Both the light beam (in the glass) and the glass itself are moving in the same direction towards the observer. Therefore, `u'` and `v` are both positive in the standard formula.\n*   **`c = 1`:** The simplification `c=1` is a common convention in relativity problems to make the algebra cleaner.

Since the glass and the light beam are moving in the same direction, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We substitute our known values (`u' = 1/n`, `v = v`, and `c = 1`) into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   **Relativity vs. Classical Mechanics:** It is crucial to recognize that this is a problem in special relativity, not classical mechanics. The simple addition of velocities is incorrect.\n*   **Speed of Light in a Medium:** The speed of light is only constant and equal to `c` in a vacuum. In a medium with a refractive index `n`, its speed is `c/n` relative to the medium's own rest frame.\n*   **Frame Definitions:** Correctly identifying which velocity belongs to which frame (`u'` in the glass's frame, `v` for the glass's motion, and `u` in the lab's frame) is essential for setting up the formula correctly.\n*   **Algebraic Accuracy:** Care must be taken during the algebraic simplification of the complex fraction to arrive at the final form.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe derived speed of light in the moving glass as measured by the laboratory observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. Comparing this with the provided options:\nA) `(1-n*v)/(n+v)`\nB) `(1+n*v)/(n-v)`\nC) `(1+n*v)/(n+v)`\nD) `1`\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Understand the physical setup**\nThis problem involves the addition of velocities in the framework of special relativity. We have two frames of reference:\n*   The **laboratory frame (S)**, where the observer is at rest.\n*   The **glass frame (S')**, which is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame.\n\nWe are given:\n*   The speed of light in a vacuum is `c=1`.\n*   The index of refraction of the glass is `n`.\n*   The velocity of the glass relative to the observer is `v`.\n\n**2. Determine the speed of light within the glass frame (S')**\nThe index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u_medium`).\n`n = c / u_medium`\nTherefore, the speed of light as measured by an observer at rest within the glass is:\n`u_medium = c / n`\nSince the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light within the glass frame is:\n`u = 1/n`\n\n**3. Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula**\nThe formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n`u' = (u + v) / (1 + u*v / c^2)`\nwhere:\n*   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) as seen by the observer in the laboratory frame (S).\n*   `u` is the velocity of the object as seen in the moving frame (S'). Here, `u = 1/n`.\n*   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the stationary frame (S). Here, `v` is the velocity of the glass.\n*   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum. Here, `c=1`.\n\n**4. Substitute the values and simplify**\nSubstitute `u = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n`u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2 )`\n`u' = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n`u' = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n`u' = (n/n + n*v) / (n*1 + n*v/n)`\n`u' = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option A.

We want to find the speed of light in this frame. Let's denote this speed by *u*.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference that is moving along with the glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the stationary frame (S):** The glass is moving at a velocity *v* relative to the laboratory. So, the velocity of frame S' with respect to frame S is *v*.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam in the moving frame (S'):** In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of light is determined by the index of refraction, *n*. The speed of light in a medium is given by *c/n*. Since the problem states to take the speed of light in vacuum *c=1*, the speed of the light beam as measured in the glass frame (S') is *u' = 1/n*.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam in the laboratory frame (S):** This is the unknown quantity we need to find, which we have denoted as *u*.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Principle:**\n    In classical physics (Galilean relativity), we would simply add the velocities: *u = u' + v = 1/n + v*. However, for speeds approaching the speed of light, we must use Einstein's theory of special relativity. The correct formula is the **relativistic velocity addition formula**.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    *u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)*\n\n5.  **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**\n    We have the following values:\n    *   *u'* = 1/n (speed of light in the glass's rest frame)\n    *   *v* = v (speed of the glass relative to the lab)\n    *   *c* = 1 (speed of light in vacuum)\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    *u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )*\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )*\n\n    To simplify this complex fraction, we can find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator, or we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by *n*. Let's use the latter method as it's more direct.\n\n    *u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / ( n * ( 1 + v/n ) )*\n\n    Distribute *n* in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    *   Numerator: n * (1/n) + n * v = 1 + n*v\n    *   Denominator: n * 1 + n * (v/n) = n + v\n\n    So, the simplified expression for *u* is:\n    *u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)*\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativity is Key:** The problem involves speeds that can be a significant fraction of the speed of light (since light is involved), so relativistic effects cannot be ignored. Using the Galilean addition *u = u' + v* would be incorrect.\n*   **Speed of Light in a Medium:** A common mistake is to assume the speed of light is always *c* (or 1 in this case). The second postulate of special relativity states that the speed of light *in a vacuum* is *c* for all inertial observers. The speed of light *in a medium* is *c/n* only in the rest frame of that medium.\n*   **Frame Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify which velocity belongs to which frame of reference. *u'* is the speed in the moving frame (S'), and *u* is the speed in the stationary lab frame (S).\n*   **Direction of Motion:** The problem states that the glass and the light beam move in the *same direction*. This is why we use the '+' sign in the numerator of the velocity addition formula, *(u' + v)*. If they were in opposite directions, we would use a '-' sign.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation Summary\n\n1.  Speed of light in the rest frame of the glass: *u' = c/n = 1/n*.\n2.  Speed of the glass in the lab frame: *v*.\n3.  Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula: *u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v/c^2)*.\n4.  Substitute values: *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)v)*.\n5.  Simplify by multiplying numerator and denominator by *n*: *u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)*.\n6.

The speed of light in a medium at rest with refractive index `n` is `c/n`. In the S' frame (where the glass is at rest), the speed of the light beam is **u' = c/n**. The problem states that `c=1`, so **u' = 1/n**. Since the beam propagates in the same direction as the glass is moving, `u'` is positive.\n    *   We need to find the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (frame S). Let's call this velocity **u**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The problem involves adding velocities at speeds that can be comparable to the speed of light, so we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula. For velocities in the same direction, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We substitute the values we have into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Now, we simplify the algebraic expression for `u`:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To clear the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n    Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    This matches option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThis problem requires the application of Einstein's velocity-addition formula.

According to the definition of the index of refraction (*n*), this speed is *u' = c/n*.\n    *   The problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum, *c*, as 1. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass, relative to the glass, is *u' = 1/n*.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity-addition formula.**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    *u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c²)*\n    Here, *u* is the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S).\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula.**\n    *   *u'* = 1/n\n    *   *v* = v\n    *   *c* = 1\n\n    This gives:\n    *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1²)*\n    *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)*\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and the denominator, multiply both by *n*:\n    *u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)*\n    *u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)*\n\nThis result corresponds to the formula derived by Max von Laue in 1907, which provided a theoretical explanation for the results of the Fizeau experiment using special relativity. The Fizeau experiment, conducted in 1851, was a key piece of evidence that shaped Einstein's thinking on the matter.

The application of the relativistic velocity addition formula is the correct approach for this problem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's stationary frame of reference.\n    *   **Glass's Rest Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference moving along with the glass.\n\n2.  **Identify Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass block (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light inside the glass, as measured from within the glass's own rest frame (S'), is `u'`. This is determined by the index of refraction `n`. The formula is `u' = c/n`. Since the problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   The goal is to find the speed of light in the moving glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). We'll call this `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    Now, substitute the values from this problem into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    This gives:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To simplify this complex fraction, find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator, which is `n`.\n    *   **Numerator:** `1/n + v = (1 + n*v) / n`\n    *   **Denominator:** `1 + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n\n    Now, divide the new numerator by the new denominator:\n    `u = ((1 + n*v) / n) / ((n + v) / n)`\n\n    The `n` terms in the denominators cancel each other out, leaving:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result correctly describes the speed of light in a moving medium as observed from a stationary laboratory frame, an effect first observed in the Fizeau experiment and later explained by Einstein's theory of special relativity. The derived formula matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
