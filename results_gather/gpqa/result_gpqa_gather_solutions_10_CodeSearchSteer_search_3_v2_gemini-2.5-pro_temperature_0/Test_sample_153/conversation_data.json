Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the most abundant isotope of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (deshielded) is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton, and its singlet (s) nature is expected as it does not couple with other protons.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is the classic pattern for a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the same for the two protons on the other side.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n*   From MS: MW = 156, contains one Cl atom.\n*   From IR: Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   From ¹H NMR: Contains a carboxylic acid proton and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** MW is correct, but the NMR would show three distinct aromatic protons and an aldehyde proton (~9-10 ppm), not a carboxylic acid proton at 11 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -Cl atom in the *para* position.\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ = (7*12) + (5*1) + 35.5 + (2*16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5. This matches.\n    *   **Functional Groups:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** It is *para*-substituted, which perfectly explains the two doublets (each 2H) in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum. This is a perfect match for all data.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** MW is correct and it is a carboxylic acid. However, being *ortho*-substituted, it would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** MW is correct, but it is an acid chloride/ester, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR peak at 11.0 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe spectral data is fully consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of about 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\nCombining these two features strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). Its integration as 1H confirms the presence of one such proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The two protons closer to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm) compared to the two protons closer to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This structure has an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. Its ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex and would not show the characteristic para-substitution pattern.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule's structure perfectly matches all the data.\n    *   **Formula (C₇H₅ClO₂):** The molecular weight is 156.57 g/mol.\n    *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid, consistent with the IR data.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** It has a *para*-substituted benzene ring, which would produce the two doublets seen in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The chemical shifts are also consistent with literature values for 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While this is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would lead to a more complex splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons in the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound lacks the hydroxyl group of a carboxylic acid, so it would not show the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ in the IR spectrum or the acidic proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral evidence unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound (using the most common isotope, ³⁵Cl) is 156 g/mol.\n*   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32 or 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   Conclusion from IR: The compound contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The 's' (singlet) indicates it has no adjacent protons, and '1H' confirms it's a single proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent equivalent.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options**\n*   **Summary:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156, contains one chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure is a para-substituted benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group. It perfectly matches all the data: MW of 156 (for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂), contains one Cl, has a carboxylic acid group, and would produce the para-substitution pattern (two doublets) in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** Lacks a carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is not a carboxylic acid. Also, its aromatic protons are all unique, which would lead to a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the ortho-substitution would make all four aromatic protons chemically distinct, leading to a complex spectrum, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only structure that fits all the provided spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the spectral data:\")\n    \n    # Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n    print(\"\\n1.

So, MW = 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative abundance of 32%. The M+ peak at m/z = 156 has a relative abundance of 100%.\n*   **Careful Point:** The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong indicator for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weights of the options:\n    *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   C) Phenyl chloroformate (C₂H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    All four options are isomers and are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic, extremely broad absorption that is the hallmark of an O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks (a very broad O-H and a C=O around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: An aldehyde and a phenol. Not a carboxylic acid. Eliminated.\n    *   C) Phenyl chloroformate: An acid chloride/ester derivative. It has no O-H group. Eliminated.\n    *   We are left with B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid, both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The integration for one proton (1H) and its singlet nature (no adjacent protons) confirm this assignment. Both remaining options (B and D) have this proton.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:** We have two signals in the aromatic region: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n*   **Careful Point:** The key to distinguishing between the remaining options lies in the symmetry and splitting pattern of the aromatic protons.\n    *   The spectrum shows only two types of aromatic protons.\n    *   Each signal is a doublet, meaning each type of proton has only one neighboring proton.\n    *   Each signal integrates to 2H, meaning there are two chemically equivalent protons of each type.\n*   **Analysis of Option B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   This is a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons ortho to the -COOH group are equivalent. The two protons ortho to the -Cl group are also equivalent.\n    *   This results in two sets of equivalent protons. The protons ortho to the -COOH will be a doublet (split by their one neighbor), and the protons ortho to the -Cl will also be a doublet (split by their one neighbor).\n    *   This predicted pattern (a doublet for 2H and another doublet for 2H) perfectly matches the experimental data. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded (8.02 ppm) than those ortho to the -Cl group (7.72 ppm).\n*   **Analysis of Option D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   This is an *ortho* (1,2) substituted benzene ring.\n    *   There is no symmetry that makes any of the four aromatic protons equivalent. All four are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Therefore, we would expect to see four distinct signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H, with more complex splitting (e.g., doublets, triplets, or doublets of doublets). This is inconsistent with the observed spectrum.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral data points unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular formula, the IR confirms the carboxylic acid functional group, and the ¹H NMR confirms the *para* substitution pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   An M+2 peak is observed at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a hallmark signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   All the proposed structures (A, B, C, D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The nominal mass for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 156 amu. The nominal mass for C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂ is (7×12) + (5×1) + 37 + (2×16) = 158 amu. Thus, all options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This evidence rules out option A (an aldehyde and an alcohol) and option D (a chloroformate, which is an ester derivative and lacks the O-H group). We are left with options B and C, which are both carboxylic acids.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** is in the highly deshielded region of the spectrum, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s) are consistent with this assignment.\n    *   The signals at **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** are in the aromatic region. The key information here is the splitting pattern and integration. We see two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H). This specific pattern is a classic indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para* compound makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in only two distinct signals. These two sets of protons split each other, creating two doublets.\n    *   Let's evaluate the remaining options based on this NMR data:\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a *para* substitution pattern (the -COOH and -Cl groups are at positions 1 and 4). This structure would produce the exact NMR spectrum described: one singlet for the acid proton and two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons.\n        *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has an *ortho* substitution pattern (groups at positions 1 and 2). This lack of symmetry would result in four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    By systematically analyzing all the spectral data, we can confidently identify the unknown compound. The MS data points to a chlorinated compound with a molecular weight of 156. The IR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR data confirms the carboxylic acid and, crucially, indicates a *para*-substituted benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of about 32% (approximately a 3:1 ratio with the M+ peak) is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom. This is due to the natural abundance of the chlorine isotopes ³⁵Cl (about 75%) and ³⁷Cl (about 25%).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this signal corresponds to the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The two different chemical shifts arise because the two substituents on the ring are different, making the chemically equivalent protons on each side of the ring magnetically distinct.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** The molecular weight (156.57 g/mol) is correct. However, its structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the characteristic broad O-H peak in the IR spectrum or the -COOH proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule's molecular weight is 156.57 g/mol, and it contains one chlorine atom, matching the MS data. As a carboxylic acid, its IR and ¹H NMR spectra would show the expected broad O-H stretch and the downfield -COOH proton signal, respectively. The *para* substitution pattern perfectly matches the two doublets seen in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** While the molecular weight is correct (156.57 g/mol), this compound is an aldehyde with a phenol group. It would not have a carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm. Its aromatic ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex, showing three distinct protons, not a simple two-doublet pattern.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This compound is a carboxylic acid with the correct molecular weight (156.57 g/mol). It would fit the IR and the carboxylic acid portion of the NMR data. However, the *ortho* substitution would result in a complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region with four unique proton signals, which contradicts the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectral data—a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom, the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, and a *para*-substituted aromatic ring—unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** A significant peak is observed at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ and M+2 pattern, with a ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32), is a distinctive indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom. This is due to the natural isotopic abundance of chlorine: ³⁵Cl (≈75%) and ³⁷Cl (≈25%). The M+ peak corresponds to the molecule containing ³⁵Cl, and the M+2 peak corresponds to the molecule containing ³⁷Cl.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. The molecular formula for all the options is C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests it belongs to a carboxylic acid. Aromatic carboxylic acids typically show a C=O stretch in the 1710-1680 cm⁻¹ range.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option D (Phenyl chloroformate), which is an ester and would not show the broad O-H stretch, and option B (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), which is an aldehyde and a phenol.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its chemical shift is high due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent carbonyl group and hydrogen bonding. It appears as a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The presence of signals between 7.0 and 8.5 ppm indicates an aromatic ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a doublet, meaning the protons are coupled to one neighboring proton. It integrates to two protons, indicating two chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This is also a doublet integrating to two protons.\n*   **Aromatic Substitution Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic sign of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry equivalent to the two on the other side. The protons at 8.02 ppm are likely *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, which deshields them significantly. The protons at 7.72 ppm are *ortho* to the chlorine atom.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Final Candidates\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This would have a 1,2-disubstitution pattern. Due to the lack of symmetry, it would show four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data:\n    *   **MS:** Molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ (MW ≈ 156.57 g/mol) with one chlorine atom.\n    *   **IR:** Contains a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Shows a carboxylic acid proton and the characteristic two-doublet pattern for a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectral data collectively and unequivocally identify the unknown compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the spectral data provided, a reasoned structural suggestion for the unidentified white solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Here is a breakdown of how the evidence supports this conclusion:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound. The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158, with an intensity about one-third of the main peak (32%), is a classic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom. All the proposed options have a molecular formula of C7H5ClO2, which corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, and all contain chlorine.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows two key features. First, a very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding. Second, the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid. This evidence strongly points towards a carboxylic acid, effectively ruling out phenyl chloroformate (which lacks an O-H group) and making 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde less likely, as a phenolic O-H stretch is usually less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:** The ¹H NMR data provides the most definitive evidence for the specific isomer.\n    *   The singlet at a downfield shift of 11.0 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The aromatic region of the spectrum shows two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, with each signal integrating to two protons (2H). This specific pattern—two doublets of equal integration—is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   Combining these observations, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits perfectly. It is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene with a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom. 2-chlorobenzoic acid, being 1,2-disubstituted, would produce a more complex splitting pattern for its four unique aromatic protons.\n\nTherefore, the combination of all three spectroscopic techniques unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak. This M⁺ to M⁺+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a definitive indicator of the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic, unmistakable signal for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration for one proton (1H) and its singlet (s) nature confirm this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent, leading to this simplified splitting pattern. The protons at 8.02 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the protons at 7.72 ppm are ortho to the chlorine atom.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group attached to a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n### 4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound is a **chlorinated benzoic acid** with a **para substitution pattern**. Let's check the proposed structures:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, and the NMR substitution pattern would be different (1,2,3-trisubstituted).\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **This structure fits all the data perfectly.**\n    *   **Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂\n    *   **MW:** 156.5 g/mol (matches MS).\n    *   **Functional Group:** Contains a carboxylic acid (matches IR and NMR).\n    *   **Substitution:** It is a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring (matches NMR splitting pattern).\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. This is an ortho-substituted ring, which would result in a more complex NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR and the acidic proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the NMR.\n\nThe evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound, using the most abundant isotopes, is 156 amu.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes: ~75% ³⁵Cl and ~25% ³⁷Cl).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula for the proposed structures. All options (A, B, C, D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   The molecular weight for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   The molecular weight for C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂ is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158.\n    *   The MS data is consistent with a compound of formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules (dimerization).\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is typical for a carbonyl group that is part of a conjugated system, such as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   This IR data strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This eliminates option B (Phenyl chloroformate, which lacks an O-H group) and option D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenolic O-H and an aldehyde C=O, but not the characteristic super-broad O-H of a carboxylic acid). We are left with options A and C, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton, and its singlet nature (s) is expected as it does not couple with other protons. This further confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The key information is the splitting pattern and integration. We have two signals, each a doublet (d), and each representing two protons (2H). This simple pattern indicates a high degree of symmetry in the benzene ring. A *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring has a plane of symmetry that makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. This leads to a pattern of two doublets, exactly as observed.\n    *   Let's compare the remaining options:\n        *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. It would show two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. This perfectly matches the observed NMR spectrum. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n        *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. It has no such symmetry. All four aromatic protons are in chemically different environments and would give rise to four separate, more complex signals (e.g., doublets of doublets, triplets), not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    All pieces of spectral evidence point to a single structure. The MS shows a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal confirm a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of the NMR shows a simple two-doublet pattern, which is characteristic of a *para*-substituted benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all of these criteria.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75.8%, and ³⁷Cl is ~24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and its position is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H').\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The presence of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is a classic pattern for a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. This pattern arises from the symmetry of the molecule, where the two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. It would not produce the simple two-doublet pattern seen in the ¹H NMR. The four aromatic protons would be unique, leading to a more complex spectrum.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule is an ester/acid chloride. It lacks the carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the broad O-H peak in the IR or the proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MS:** The molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the MS data.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, which matches the IR data perfectly.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It is a *para*-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group. This structure would produce a signal for the carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm) and the characteristic two-doublet pattern for the four aromatic protons. This is a perfect match for all the spectral data.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have a proton signal at 11.0 ppm. The aldehyde proton would appear around 9-10 ppm. The aromatic region would show three signals for the three protons, not two signals for four protons.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of evidence point conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weight of the options, all of which are isomers with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   MW = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 35 + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   All options match the molecular weight and the presence of one chlorine atom. We must use the other spectral data to differentiate them.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very distinctive feature. A very broad absorption in this region is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids:\n    *   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. Ruled out.\n    *   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester/acid chloride derivative. It lacks the O-H group for the broad peak. Ruled out.\n    *   We are left with **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** and **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**, both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**). The 's' indicates it is a singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with), and '1H' confirms it represents a single proton. This is consistent with both remaining options (B and D).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The pattern in the aromatic region is the key to distinguishing between the remaining isomers.\n    *   We see two signals: a doublet at 8.02 ppm integrating to 2H, and another doublet at 7.72 ppm integrating to 2H.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic signature of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. Due to the symmetry of the para-substitution, there are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to one substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   **Let's analyze the remaining options:**\n        *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho* (1,2) substituted ring. The four aromatic protons would all be in different chemical environments, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four distinct signals), not two simple doublets.\n        *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para* (1,4) substituted ring. This substitution pattern perfectly matches the observed NMR data of two doublets, each for 2H. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom appear slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll three pieces of spectral data are consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **MS:** MW of 156 and one Cl atom.\n*   **IR:** Confirms a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, crucially, the *para* substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nTherefore, the unidentified solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158, with an intensity of about one-third (32%) of the M+ peak, is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (A, B, C, and D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with this data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, it aligns well with the C=O stretch of an aromatic carboxylic acid (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This evidence makes options C (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid) the most likely candidates, while ruling out A (an aldehyde with a regular alcohol -OH) and B (a chloroformate with no -OH group).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield and appearing as a singlet is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm) is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The ring has two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm). Each set appears as a doublet because they are splitting each other.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The singlet at 11.0 ppm confirms the carboxylic acid. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, confirms a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   **Option A (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde):** Inconsistent with the very broad IR peak and the NMR data.\n*   **Option B (Phenyl chloroformate):** Inconsistent with IR and NMR data (no O-H group).\n*   **Option D (2-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. It would show a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, with four distinct signals for the four non-equivalent aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **Option C (4-chlorobenzoic acid):** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data. It has the correct mass and chlorine isotope pattern. The IR data matches a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR shows a carboxylic acid proton and the characteristic *para*-substitution pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region.\n\nTherefore, the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the provided spectral data, the unidentified white solid is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. Here is a breakdown of how the evidence supports this conclusion:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂).\n    *   The peak at m/z = 158, which is approximately one-third the intensity of the molecular ion peak, is the characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad peak observed between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is definitive for the O-H bond stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at a very downfield chemical shift of 11.0 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, one at 8.02 ppm (2H) and one at 7.72 ppm (2H), indicates a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield, while the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are slightly upfield. This specific pattern strongly supports the 4-chloro (or para) substitution.\n\n### Evaluation of Other Options:\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct molecular weight, its ¹H NMR spectrum would be much more complex than two simple doublets due to the ortho-substitution pattern.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR spectrum and the acidic proton signal around 11 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This compound is an aldehyde with a phenolic hydroxyl group. It would not show the characteristic broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal for a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of its NMR spectrum would also be different, showing three distinct protons with complex splitting.\n\nTherefore, the combination of all spectral data points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the correct structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified compound is identified as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectral Data:**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound.\n    *   The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of approximately 32% is a classic M+2 isotope pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom. The natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is roughly 76% ³⁵Cl and 24% ³⁷Cl, leading to an M+/(M+2) peak ratio of about 3:1. This confirms the molecular formula contains one chlorine atom and the molecular weight is 156 g/mol.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with the carbonyl group in an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at a significant downfield shift of 11.0 ppm, integrating to one proton (1H), is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The two signals in the aromatic region, a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H), suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The symmetry of a 1,4-disubstituted ring results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, each appearing as a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent proton. This pattern is a hallmark of para-substitution. Published spectral data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirm these chemical shifts.\n\n### **Evaluation of Alternatives:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct molecular weight, the ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex, showing four distinct signals in the aromatic region due to the lack of symmetry.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound lacks the hydroxyl group necessary for the broad IR peak and the acidic proton seen at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This structure is inconsistent with the ¹H NMR data, as it would show an aldehyde proton (around 9-10 ppm) and a different, more complex aromatic splitting pattern. It also lacks a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined evidence from Mass Spectrometry, IR Spectroscopy, and ¹H NMR Spectroscopy unequivocally points to the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound (using the most common isotopes) is 156 g/mol.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ / (M+2) ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single **chlorine** atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and very strong indicator of the O-H stretching vibration within a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (δ > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a highly deshielded proton. This chemical shift, combined with the integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s), is definitive for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid** (-COO**H**).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-substitution means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and they split each other into doublets. The downfield position of these protons indicates they are attached to a ring with electron-withdrawing groups.\n\n**Putting It All Together**\n\n1.  From the MS, we know the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n2.  From the IR and ¹H NMR, we know the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n3.  From the ¹H NMR, we know there is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n\nLet's assemble the pieces: we have a benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group attached at the 1 and 4 positions. This structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**Let's check 4-chlorobenzoic acid (Option D) against the data:**\n\n*   **Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂\n*   **Molecular Weight:** (7×12) + (5×1) + (1×35.5) + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5. This matches the m/z of 156.\n*   **MS:** Contains one Cl atom. Matches.\n*   **IR:** Is an aromatic carboxylic acid. Matches.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Has a carboxylic acid proton and a para-substituted ring. Matches perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable structural suggestion is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peaks:** The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion (M+) peak at m/z = 156 and another peak (M+2) at m/z = 158.\n*   **Isotopic Abundance:** The ratio of the intensities of these peaks is 100% to 32% (approximately 3:1). This M+ and M+2 pattern is a distinct signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, corresponding to its two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (24.2% abundance).\n*   **Molecular Weight:** The molecular weight of the compound containing the ³⁵Cl isotope is 156 g/mol.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n### 3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly indicative of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its integration as one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (due to rapid chemical exchange and no adjacent protons to couple with) confirm this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indication of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two equivalent sets. The downfield doublet at 8.02 ppm corresponds to the two protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the slightly more upfield doublet at 7.72 ppm corresponds to the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom. Published spectral data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid show similar chemical shifts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the combined evidence:\n\n1.  **Mass Spec** confirms a molecular formula containing one chlorine atom with a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope).\n2.  **IR** confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n3.  **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid proton and indicates a *para*-substituted aromatic ring.\n\nEvaluating the given options:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Inconsistent with the IR (not a carboxylic acid) and the NMR splitting pattern.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* substitution would produce a more complex splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons in the NMR, not two doublets of 2H each.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** The structure perfectly matches all spectral data. Its molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is (7*12)+(5*1)+35.5+(2*16) = 156.5 g/mol. It is a carboxylic acid, consistent with the IR spectrum. It has a *para*-substituted ring, which would give the observed 2H doublet + 2H doublet pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Inconsistent with the IR (no broad O-H) and NMR (no acidic proton, different aromatic pattern).\n\nThe spectral information strongly and consistently points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This tells us the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes is 156 amu.\n    *   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158, which is about 32% of the height of the M+ peak (100%). A M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a definitive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (since the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75% and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options (using C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35):\n        *   A) C₇H₅ClO₂: (7\\*12) + (5\\*1) + (35) + (2\\*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. (Matches)\n        *   B) C₇H₅ClO₂: (7\\*12) + (5\\*1) + (35) + (2\\*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. (Matches)\n        *   C) C₇H₅ClO₂: (7\\*12) + (5\\*1) + (35) + (2\\*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. (Matches)\n        *   D) C₇H₅ClO₂: (7\\*12) + (5\\*1) + (35) + (2\\*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. (Matches)\n    *   All options have the correct molecular formula and weight. The MS data confirms the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid carbonyl.\n    *   This combination strongly suggests the molecule is a carboxylic acid. This rules out option A (aldehyde/phenol) and option D (phenyl chloroformate, which is an acyl chloride/ester hybrid and would lack the broad O-H peak).\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, which is the typical region for a carboxylic acid proton. The integration of 1H (one proton) and its multiplicity as a singlet (s, no adjacent protons) confirms the -COOH group.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The remaining signals are in the aromatic region. We have a total of 4 aromatic protons (2H + 2H). The benzene ring must be di-substituted.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The pattern shows two doublets (d), each representing two protons. This symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons adjacent to one substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   This NMR data points directly to a para-substituted structure.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Remaining Options:**\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is a carboxylic acid with a chlorine atom at the para (4) position. This structure perfectly matches all the data:\n        *   MS: Correct molecular weight and has one Cl.\n        *   IR: Has a carboxylic acid group.\n        *   ¹H NMR: Has a carboxylic acid proton and a para-substituted ring pattern.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted molecule. While it's a carboxylic acid, its four aromatic protons would not be symmetrical and would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR, not two simple doublets of 2H each.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the combined spectral evidence, the only structure that fits all the data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectral data to identify the correct chemical structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n    # M+ peak at m/z=156 indicates a molecular weight of 156.\n    # The M+2 peak at m/z=158 with 32% intensity (a ~3:1 ratio with M+) is a classic sign of one Chlorine atom.\n    # All four options have the formula C7H5ClO2 and a molecular weight of 156, so all are initially possible.\n\n    # IR Spectroscopy Analysis\n    # A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 is characteristic of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    # A strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    # This evidence strongly suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid, which rules out:\n    # A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde)\n    # D) Phenyl chloroformate (an acyl chloride/ester)\n\n    # 1H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\n    # The signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H) is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    # The signals at 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H) are in the aromatic region.\n    # The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, indicates a symmetrically 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    # Let's check the remaining options against this NMR data:\n    # B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This is a para-substituted benzoic acid.

This is a classic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine (Cl) atom in the molecule. The natural abundances of chlorine isotopes are approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is located in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (which lowers the frequency from a typical non-conjugated value of ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (>10 ppm):** A signal this far downfield is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Confirms it is a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** Expected, as this proton is not adjacent to any other protons.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7-8.5 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region, indicating they are protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Integration (2H each):** There are two sets of two chemically equivalent protons. This means the benzene ring has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** Each signal is a doublet, meaning each set of protons is coupled to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This specific pattern—two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons—is a classic fingerprint for a **para-disubstituted** (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two substituents are different, causing the two sets of protons to have different chemical shifts.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options**\n*   From **MS**, we know the compound has MW = 156 and contains one Cl atom.\n*   From **IR** and **¹H NMR**, we know it contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   From **¹H NMR**, we know it has a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nCombining these facts, the structure must be a benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in the *para* (1,4) positions. This compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's verify this against the options:\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   MW (C₇H₅ClO₂) = 156.5 g/mol. Correct.\n    *   Contains one Cl. Correct.\n    *   Is a carboxylic acid. Correct.\n    *   Is *para*-disubstituted, which matches the NMR pattern. Correct. This is a perfect match.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** No carboxylic acid group. Incorrect.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid (NMR peak at 11.0 ppm rules this out). The aromatic NMR pattern would be much more complex (three different protons). Incorrect.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-disubstituted ring. It would have four non-equivalent aromatic protons, leading to a complex NMR splitting pattern, not two doublets of 2H each. Incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** All spectral data points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion (M⁺) peak is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   A peak at m/z = 158 (M⁺+2) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak (100%) is observed. This ~3:1 ratio for M⁺:(M⁺+2) is the characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula for the proposed structures. All options (A, B, C, D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl) is: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. This matches the M⁺ peak. The MS data confirms the molecular formula and the presence of one chlorine atom but doesn't distinguish between the isomers.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The spectrum shows a very broad peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This is the classic signature of an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid dimerized through hydrogen bonding.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This frequency is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, specifically an aryl carboxylic acid (conjugated carbonyl).\n    *   The combination of these two features is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. This allows us to eliminate option A (phenyl chloroformate, which is an acid chloride/ester) and option D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which is an aldehyde and a phenol). This leaves us with options B (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and C (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n*   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Signal at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is in the typical chemical shift range (10-13 ppm) for a carboxylic acid proton. Its high deshielding is characteristic. It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with nearby protons and integrates to one proton ('1H'). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **Signals at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern is crucial for determining the substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n        *   We see two signals, each a doublet ('d'), and each integrating to two protons ('2H'). This symmetrical pattern indicates a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are only two sets of chemically equivalent protons, and each set splits the other into a doublet.\n        *   Let's analyze the remaining options:\n            *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho* (1,2) substituted ring. All four aromatic protons would be chemically non-equivalent, leading to four distinct and more complex signals (not two simple doublets).\n            *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para* (1,4) substituted ring. It possesses the required symmetry to produce two doublets, each for two protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom appear slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combined spectral data points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular formula and presence of chlorine, the IR confirms the carboxylic acid group, and the ¹H NMR confirms the *para* substitution pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo identify the unknown white solid, we must analyze the provided spectral data and compare it with the structures of the possible options.\n\n### Analysis of Spectral Data:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   A molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n    *   The presence of a peak at **m/z = 158** with a relative intensity of about 32% (M+2 peak) is a strong indicator of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, due to the natural isotopic abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl (approximately 3:1 ratio).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the options: The chemical formula for all four options is C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   A **strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This combination of peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.

It would not have the characteristic carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum or the specific broad IR peak of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester-like molecule (an acid chloride). It lacks the acidic proton and therefore would not show a signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR or the broad O-H stretch in the IR spectrum.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MS:** It contains chlorine and has the correct molecular weight.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR data perfectly.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It has a carboxylic acid proton (matches 11.0 ppm signal) and a *para*-substituted ring, which would produce two doublets for the aromatic protons.

This matches the data exactly.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MS and IR:** As a chlorobenzoic acid isomer, it matches the mass and IR data.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Although it has the carboxylic acid proton, its *ortho* (1,2) substitution pattern on the benzene ring would create a more complex splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons, not two simple doublets integrating to 2H each.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe combined evidence from mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, and ¹H NMR spectroscopy points unequivocally to **4-chlorobenzoic acid** as the identity of the unknown compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1.

Chlorine has two common isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, in an approximate 3:1 natural abundance, which leads to this characteristic M+ and M+2 peak pattern.\n*   All the proposed molecules (A, B, C, and D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, consistent with the MS data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   This combination strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group. Options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) contain this functional group. Option C (Phenyl chloroformate) is an ester and would lack the broad O-H peak. Option D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) has a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde group, which would show different IR absorptions.\n\n### 3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is almost exclusively due to a carboxylic acid proton. The integration of one proton (1H) confirms this assignment. This further supports options A and B.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, indicates a symmetrically 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Option A (2-chlorobenzoic acid):** This ortho-substituted ring would produce a more complex splitting pattern with four distinct aromatic proton signals.\n    *   **Option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid):** This para-substituted ring has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons adjacent to the -COOH group equivalent and the two protons adjacent to the -Cl group equivalent. This leads to the observed pattern of two doublets. NMR data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirms two aromatic signals around 7.5-8.0 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectral data points conclusively to **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n*   **MS** confirms the molecular weight of 156 g/mol and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   **IR** confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, crucially, the *para* substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe provided spectral data allows for a clear determination of the unknown compound's structure. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of about one-third (32%) is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing a single chlorine atom. The molecular weight of all possible answers is approximately 156.5 g/mol, consistent with this finding.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows a very broad absorption band in the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ region, which is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. Furthermore, the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid. This combination strongly suggests the presence of a -COOH group, pointing toward either 2-chlorobenzoic acid or 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm, integrating to one proton (1H), is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.\n    *   The aromatic region displays a simple pattern of two doublets: one at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another at 7.72 ppm (2H). This pattern indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring results in two sets of equivalent protons, which appear as two doublets. 2-chlorobenzoic acid, being ortho-substituted, would produce a more complex splitting pattern.\n    *   Therefore, the NMR data is uniquely consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the combined evidence from Mass Spectrometry (chlorine presence), IR spectroscopy (carboxylic acid functional group), and ¹H NMR (para-substituted aromatic ring), the unknown compound is identified as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is ~75% ³⁵Cl and ~25% ³⁷Cl.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (containing ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is part of an aromatic system.\n    *   Together, these two peaks are definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, in the typical region for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet ('s') because this proton is not typically coupled to other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H'). This confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). There are a total of 4 aromatic protons (2H + 2H). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. In this pattern, the two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent, and the two protons on the other side are also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two distinct doublets.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the very broad IR peak and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm. Incorrect.\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n        *   **Structure:** A benzene ring substituted with a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom at the 1 and 4 (para) positions.\n        *   **MS:** The molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 156. This matches the MS data, including the M+2 peak for the chlorine isotope.\n        *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, which matches the IR spectrum perfectly.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** It is a para-substituted benzene ring, which would produce the observed pattern of two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons. It also has the carboxylic acid proton that appears at 11.0 ppm. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted ring. While it is a carboxylic acid and has the correct molecular weight, the 4 aromatic protons would have a much more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR, not two simple doublets. Incorrect.\n    *   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR and the -COOH proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR. Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** All spectral data are consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a classic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl is ~75% abundant, ³⁷Cl is ~25% abundant).\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid's carbonyl group.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton. It is a singlet because it does not couple with neighboring protons. The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in this simple A₂B₂ or AA'BB' splitting pattern.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzoic acid. It fits the molecular weight and the carboxylic acid functional group. However, the four aromatic protons would be unique and would produce a more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have the characteristic carboxylic acid proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR or the very broad O-H stretch in the IR.\n    *   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule is an acid chloride/ester. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not show the signals for a carboxylic acid in the IR and ¹H NMR.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule perfectly matches all the data.\n        *   **MW:** Its formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is 156 g/mol, and with ³⁷Cl is 158 g/mol, matching the MS data.\n        *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n        *   **Substitution Pattern:** It is a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring, which perfectly explains the two doublets (each for 2H) seen in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** All spectral data are consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, with a relative intensity of 32% compared to the M⁺ peak (100%), gives a ratio of approximately 3:1. This M⁺/M⁺+2 ratio is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and very distinctive feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The significant broadness is caused by extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When observed along with the very broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid** functional group. A conjugated aromatic carboxylic acid typically absorbs in the 1725-1700 cm⁻¹ range.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically in the 10-13 ppm range) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration (1H) confirms it is a single proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region, indicating a substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The total integration of 4H (2H + 2H) means the ring is disubstituted.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each representing two equivalent protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This high degree of symmetry results in only two types of aromatic protons, which couple with each other to form doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule consists of a para-disubstituted benzene ring attached to a carboxylic acid group.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   The combined data indicates that the unknown compound is a chlorobenzoic acid with a para substitution pattern.\n\n*   Let's evaluate the given options:\n\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n        *   **Structure:** It has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in a 1,4 (para) arrangement on a benzene ring. This matches the ¹H NMR pattern.\n        *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid, which matches the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal.\n        *   **Molecular Weight:** The formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The mass for the ³⁵Cl isotope is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 156. This matches the MS data.\n        *   This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data.\n\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted isomer. Its four unique aromatic protons would give a much more complex NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n    *   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have the characteristic IR and NMR signals for a carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride and lacks an O-H group. It would not show the broad IR peak or the acidic proton signal in the NMR.\n\nThe evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the nominal molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a classic isotopic signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options. All options (Phenyl chloroformate, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-chlorobenzoic acid) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Let's calculate the nominal mass: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the M+ peak. The MS data confirms the molecular formula contains one chlorine atom and is consistent with all the given options.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding dimers.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid carbonyl.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   This finding eliminates option A (Phenyl chloroformate, which is an ester/acid chloride and would lack the broad O-H peak) and option C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenolic O-H and an aldehyde C=O, but the combination of the very broad O-H and the NMR data points away from this). We are left with options B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet because it does not typically couple with other protons. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). We have a total of 4 aromatic protons. The key information is the splitting pattern and integration. We see two signals, each being a doublet and each integrating to two protons. This symmetrical pattern is a hallmark of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two protons ortho to one group equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other group equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   Let's compare this to the remaining options:\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. It would exhibit the exact symmetrical pattern of two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would deshield the ortho protons (likely the 8.02 ppm signal), while the protons ortho to the chlorine would be at a slightly different chemical shift (likely the 7.72 ppm signal). This is a perfect match.\n        *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. There is no plane of symmetry that makes protons equivalent. All four aromatic protons are in chemically distinct environments. This would result in a much more complex spectrum, likely with four separate signals (e.g., multiplets), not two simple doublets. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data points unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the mass and presence of chlorine. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal confirm the carboxylic acid group. The symmetrical aromatic pattern in the NMR (two doublets, 2H each) confirms the *para* substitution pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nBased on the spectral information, the most reasonable structure for the unidentified compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. Here is a detailed analysis of why this structure is the correct choice:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound. The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is about one-third the intensity of the main peak, is a classic isotopic signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes). 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂) has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, which is consistent with this data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows two key features. First, an extremely broad absorption between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. Second, the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at a very downfield chemical shift of 11.0 ppm is indicative of a highly acidic proton, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   The aromatic region displays two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, with each signal integrating to two protons (2H). This symmetrical pattern of two doublets is a hallmark of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The protons next to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm) compared to the protons next to the chlorine atom.\n\n### Evaluation of Other Options:\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it matches the molecular weight and IR data, its *ortho*-substitution pattern would produce a more complex and asymmetric set of signals in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This compound lacks a carboxylic acid, so it would not show a proton signal around 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR, nor the very broad O-H stretch characteristic of a carboxylic acid in the IR spectrum.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule lacks an O-H group entirely, which is inconsistent with the IR spectrum. It also does not have a carboxylic acid proton, which contradicts the ¹H NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data, the unknown compound is identified as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of approximately 32% are characteristic of a compound with a molecular weight of 156 containing one chlorine atom. All the proposed structures have a molecular weight of 156.57 g/mol and contain a single chlorine atom, making them consistent with this data.\n\n*   **IR Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows a very broad absorption band in the range of 3500-2700 cm⁻¹, which is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. Additionally, the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of the carboxylic acid. This combination of peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, effectively ruling out 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and phenol) and phenyl chloroformate (an ester). Both 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid are consistent with this data.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:** The proton NMR spectrum provides the most definitive evidence for the specific isomer.\n    *   The singlet at a very downfield chemical shift of 11.0 ppm is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The aromatic region displays two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, with each signal integrating to two protons (2H). This pattern is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry in a para-substituted ring results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, which split each other to produce two doublets.\n    *   4-chlorobenzoic acid fits this pattern perfectly. The protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear as a doublet at 8.02 ppm, while the protons adjacent (ortho) to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded and appear as a doublet at 7.72 ppm.\n    *   In contrast, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, being a 1,2-disubstituted ring, would show a more complex splitting pattern with four distinct signals for the aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combined spectral data—particularly the classic para-substituted pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum—unambiguously points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the correct structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified white solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Here is a detailed breakdown of how the data supports this conclusion:\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound. The molecular formula for 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C₇H₅ClO₂, and its molecular weight is approximately 156.57 g/mol. This is consistent with the observed molecular ion peak.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, with an abundance of about one-third of the M+ peak (32%), is a definitive indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom. Chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with natural abundances of approximately 75.8% and 24.2%, respectively. This leads to a characteristic M:(M+2) peak ratio of roughly 3:1 for chlorinated compounds.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is indicative of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a conjugated aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n### **3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** The singlet appearing far downfield is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its high chemical shift is due to the strong deshielding effect of the adjacent carbonyl group.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two equivalent sets. The set closer to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group is more deshielded and thus appears further downfield (8.02 ppm). The set closer to the chlorine atom appears slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm). Literature data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirms similar chemical shifts for these protons.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll three spectroscopic methods provide complementary evidence that points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The other options are inconsistent with the provided data:\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Would have a more complex NMR splitting pattern in the aromatic region.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Would not show a carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm in the NMR spectrum, and the IR O-H stretch would differ.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Lacks the carboxylic acid group and therefore would not show the characteristic broad O-H stretch in the IR or the -COOH proton in the NMR.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is at **m/z = 156**.

This M⁺ to M+2 ratio of approximately 100:32 (or ~3:1) is a distinct isotopic pattern indicating the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl have a natural abundance ratio of roughly 3:1).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options:\n        *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = 156.57 g/mol.\n        *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = 156.57 g/mol.\n        *   C) Phenyl chloroformate (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = 156.57 g/mol.\n        *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = 156.57 g/mol.\n    *   All four options have the correct molecular weight and contain one chlorine atom. The MS data is consistent with all of them.\n\n2.  **Infrared Spectroscopy (IR):**\n    *   A **very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A **strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This value falls squarely in the range for a carboxylic acid carbonyl (~1725-1700 cm⁻¹).\n    *   This combination of peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This eliminates options **C** (which is a chloroformate, lacking an O-H group) and **D** (which has an aldehyde C=O and a phenol O-H, whose O-H stretch is typically narrower than that of a carboxylic acid). We are left with options A and B.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR):**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, in the region characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. The integration of 1H confirms this assignment.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   Let's compare this NMR data with the remaining options:\n        *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted (1,2-disubstituted) ring. It would have four non-equivalent aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four distinct multiplets), not two simple doublets.\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) ring. It has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom. This structure would produce exactly the observed NMR spectrum:\n            *   One singlet for the carboxylic acid proton (~11.0 ppm).\n            *   Two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group would be more deshielded (the 8.02 ppm peak), and the protons ortho to the -Cl group would be slightly less deshielded (the 7.72 ppm peak).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll three pieces of spectral data point unambiguously to **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. It has the correct molecular weight and chlorine isotope pattern (MS), the characteristic peaks for a carboxylic acid (IR), and the specific NMR pattern for a para-substituted aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid proton (¹H NMR).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nBased on the spectral data provided, the unidentified compound is **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**. Here is a step-by-step analysis that supports this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound. The formula for 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C₇H₅ClO₂ which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, consistent with this peak.\n    *   The peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of about 32% to the main peak is the M+2 peak. The 3:1 ratio of the M+ to M+2 peaks is a distinct isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom.\n    *   All four options have the same molecular formula and would produce these peaks.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad peak observed between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   This combination strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), which effectively rules out options C (phenyl chloroformate) and D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), leaving A and B as the most likely candidates.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This singlet far downfield is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. Its signal is often broad, but being a singlet is expected as it does not have adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region is the key to determining the exact isomer. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, indicates a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring is symmetrically substituted. The two protons next to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are chemically equivalent, as are the two protons next to the chlorine atom. This symmetry results in two signals, each representing two protons. Their proximity to each other causes them to appear as doublets.\n    *   In contrast, 2-chlorobenzoic acid (option B) has four unique aromatic protons and would show a much more complex spectrum with four separate signals in the aromatic region.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined data from MS, IR, and ¹H NMR all consistently point to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular weight and the presence of chlorine. The IR confirms the carboxylic acid functional group. The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, most definitively, the *para* substitution pattern on the aromatic ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is my step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol (using the most common isotope, ³⁵Cl).\n*   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of about 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This ~3:1 ratio of M+ to M+2 is a classic isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule (since the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75% and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n*   All four options (C₇H₅ClO₂) have a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with this finding.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, where the broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This specific frequency falls nicely within the range for a carboxylic acid's carbonyl group.\n*   Conclusion from IR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates options C (phenyl chloroformate) and D (aldehyde), as they do not have a carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is the defining peak for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It's a singlet because it typically does not couple with other protons. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons (for a total of four aromatic protons), is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution results in only two unique types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Remaining Options**\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted (1,2-disubstituted) ring. Due to the lack of symmetry, it would produce a more complex splitting pattern for its four aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) ring. This structure has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom. It perfectly matches all the data:\n    *   It contains one Cl atom (MS).\n    *   It is a carboxylic acid (IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR peak).\n    *   It is para-substituted, which would give two doublets in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nBased on the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectral data to identify an unknown compound from a list of options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Provided Data\n    mass_spec = {\n        'm/z=156': '100% (M+ peak)',\n        'm/z=158': '32% (M+2 peak)'\n    }\n    ir_spec = {\n        '3500-2700 cm-1': 'broad peak',\n        '1720 cm-1': 'strong sharp peak'\n    }\n    nmr_spec = {\n        '11.0 ppm': 'singlet, 1H',\n        '8.02 ppm': 'doublet, 2H',\n        '7.72 ppm': 'doublet, 2H'\n    }\n\n    # Options\n    options = {\n        'A': '2-chlorobenzoic acid',\n        'B': '4-chlorobenzoic acid',\n        'C': 'Phenyl chloroformate',\n        'D': '3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-Step Analysis:\")\n    \n    # --- Analysis ---\n    print(\"\\n1.

The natural abundances of chlorine isotopes are approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl, which gives an expected M+ to M+2 peak ratio of about 3:1 (or 100%:33%). The observed ratio of 100%:32% is a perfect match.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch around 1720 cm⁻¹ in conjunction with the broad O-H stretch is definitive for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, a region characteristic of highly acidic protons. The chemical shift, singlet multiplicity (no adjacent protons), and integration (1H) are all perfectly consistent with the proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** Both of these signals are in the chemical shift range for aromatic protons (protons on a benzene ring).\n*   **Splitting Pattern and Integration (8.02 ppm, doublet, 2H; 7.72 ppm, doublet, 2H):**\n    *   The total integration in this region is 2H + 2H = 4H. This indicates a disubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para arrangement leads to two sets of chemically equivalent protons, each appearing as a doublet due to splitting by its neighbor.\n    *   The downfield shift (to 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm) indicates both substituents on the ring are electron-withdrawing. A carboxylic acid group is strongly electron-withdrawing, and a chlorine atom is also electron-withdrawing.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound has a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring, a carboxylic acid group, and four aromatic protons.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize All Data and Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **Summary:** The molecule is a carboxylic acid containing a single chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring in a *para* (1,4) arrangement relative to the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Proposed Structure:** This leads to the structure of **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the options provided:\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, and the aromatic proton pattern would be different (1,2,3-trisubstituted).\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. This is an *ortho*-substituted isomer. The 4 aromatic protons would have a more complex splitting pattern, not two doublets.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is not a carboxylic acid (lacks the acidic -OH group) and would have different IR and NMR signals.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the data:\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ gives a molecular weight of ~156.5 g/mol (156 for ³⁵Cl isotope).\n    *   **IR:** Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Has a carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm) and a *para*-disubstituted ring (two doublets, 2H each).\n\nThe unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nBased on the spectral analysis:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry:** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the isotopic peak at m/z = 158 with a relative abundance of ~32% (M+2 peak) strongly indicate the presence of a single chlorine atom. The calculated molecular weight for C₇H₅ClO₂ (the molecular formula for all options) is 156 g/mol, which matches the data.\n\n2.  **IR Spectroscopy:** The very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid dimer. The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring. This evidence points to the molecule being a carboxylic acid, thus eliminating phenyl chloroformate (B) and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D).\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H) is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H) in the aromatic region are characteristic of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para* substitution pattern results in two sets of equivalent protons, leading to two doublets, each representing two hydrogens.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to a chlorobenzoic acid with a *para* substitution pattern.\n\n*   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is *ortho*-substituted and would have a more complex NMR spectrum with four distinct aromatic signals.\n*   C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is *para*-substituted and would exhibit the exact NMR pattern observed: two doublets, each for two protons.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound with its most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** A peak is observed at m/z = 158. The mass difference of 2 units (158 - 156) and the relative intensity ratio of the M+2 peak to the M+ peak (32%, which is approximately 1:3) is a characteristic pattern for a molecule containing one chlorine atom. This is due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (4-chlorobenzoic acid, phenyl chloroformate, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, and 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight that matches this data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded, typically as a dimer.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of the extremely broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This makes 4-chlorobenzoic acid (A) and 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C) the most likely candidates. Phenyl chloroformate (B) lacks the O-H group, and its carbonyl stretch would be at a higher frequency. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D) has an -OH and a C=O group, but the O-H peak of a phenol is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid, and the aldehyde and phenol combination does not fit the overall pattern as well as a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** The signal at such a high chemical shift (downfield) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Its integration as one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s) are consistent with this assignment.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The two signals in the aromatic region provide crucial information about the substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   There are two distinct signals, not four, which indicates a degree of symmetry in the molecule.\n    *   Both signals are doublets (d), and each integrates to two protons (2H).\n    *   This specific pattern—two doublets, each representing two protons—is the classic signature of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para*-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry equivalent to the two on the other side.\n*   **Evaluating Remaining Options:**\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a *para* substitution pattern. It possesses a plane of symmetry that results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are shifted downfield (8.02 ppm), while the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are at a slightly higher field (7.72 ppm). This perfectly matches the observed spectrum.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *ortho*-substituted. It has no such symmetry, and all four aromatic protons are in chemically different environments. This would lead to four separate signals, not two.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule is also unsymmetrically substituted and would show three distinct signals for its three aromatic protons.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining all the spectral evidence, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the only structure that fits all the data. The MS shows a chlorinated compound with a mass of 156. The IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm confirm a carboxylic acid. The aromatic signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum definitively point to a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of about 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+/(M+2) ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic pattern for a molecule containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   All the proposed structures have a chemical formula of C₇H₅ClO₂. The calculated molecular weight for this formula is approximately 156.57 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This very broad absorption is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. The position, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   The IR data points towards a carboxylic acid. Options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid) are carboxylic acids. Option B (Phenyl chloroformate) is an acyl chloride ester, which would lack the broad O-H peak. Option C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) has a hydroxyl and an aldehyde group, but the O-H peak of a phenol is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid, and it lacks the specific carboxylic acid proton signal in the NMR.\n\n### 3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Its integration as 1H confirms one such proton. This further supports the carboxylic acid assignment and rules out options B and C.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   The spectrum shows two signals in the aromatic region, both of which are doublets, and each integrates to 2H.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is indicative of a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring results in only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons.\n    *   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (Option A)** is *ortho*-substituted. This would result in four unique aromatic proton signals, creating a more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (Option D)** is *para*-substituted. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm). The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the chlorine atom are less deshielded and appear slightly upfield (7.72 ppm). This predicted pattern perfectly matches the experimental data. Published NMR data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirms these chemical shifts.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic methods:\n*   **MS** confirms a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   **IR** confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid proton and shows a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nAll data are consistent only with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n### Analysis of Spectral Data to Identify Unnamed Compound\n\nBased on the provided spectral information, a step-by-step analysis leads to the identification of the unknown white solid.\n\n#### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)\nThe mass spectrum provides crucial information about the molecular weight and elemental composition of the compound.\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** A peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound, containing the most abundant isotopes, is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** A peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32% suggests the presence of a chlorine atom. Chlorine has two common isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with natural abundances of approximately 75% and 25%, respectively. This leads to an M+ to M+2 peak ratio of about 3:1, which matches the observed 100% to 32% ratio.\n\nCalculating the molecular weights of the options with ³⁵Cl:\n*   **Phenyl chloroformate (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂):** 156.56 g/mol.\n*   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂):** 156.57 g/mol.\n*   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂):** 156.57 g/mol.\n*   **3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂):** 156.57 g/mol.\n\nAll four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n#### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy\nThe IR spectrum reveals the functional groups present in the molecule.\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded, typically as a dimer.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n\nThis information strongly points to the presence of an aromatic carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This allows us to eliminate phenyl chloroformate (A), which lacks the -OH group, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D), which has an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group, but not a carboxylic acid. Both 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B) and 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C) are consistent with this data.\n\n#### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides detailed information about the structure and chemical environment of the hydrogen atoms.\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal, far downfield, is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its integration as a single proton confirms this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm) indicate four protons on a benzene ring. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. This symmetry results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm).\n\n#### Conclusion\nEvaluating the remaining options based on the ¹H NMR data:\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a *para*-substitution pattern, which would produce the observed two doublets for two protons each in the aromatic region. This structure is consistent with all three pieces of spectral data.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has an *ortho*-substitution pattern. This would result in a more complex splitting pattern with four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\nTherefore, the only structure that fits all the provided spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotope of each element.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The intensity ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formulas and weights of the options for the ³⁵Cl isotope:\n        *   All options (A, B, C, D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   Molecular Weight = (7 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + (1 × 35.45) + (2 × 16.00) ≈ 156.5 g/mol. Using integer masses for C (12), H (1), O (16), and ³⁵Cl (35), the MW is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the M+ peak. The M+2 peak at 158 would correspond to the molecule containing the ³⁷Cl isotope.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   There is a very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This is a textbook signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules causes this significant broadening.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carbonyl in a conjugated system, such as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is characteristic of the highly deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid. The integration of 1H confirms it's a single proton, and it appears as a singlet because it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substitution makes the two protons ortho to one substituent chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. The downfield position of these signals indicates that the benzene ring is attached to electron-withdrawing groups (like -Cl and -COOH). The most deshielded protons (8.02 ppm) are likely the two protons ortho to the strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The protons at 7.72 ppm would be the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Contains an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. The NMR would show 3 distinct aromatic protons, not the 2H/2H doublet pattern.\n    *   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride. It lacks the acidic O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) isomer. It has a carboxylic acid group, but its four aromatic protons would be non-equivalent, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule fits all the data perfectly.\n        *   It has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope).\n        *   It contains one chlorine atom.\n        *   It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR data.\n        *   It is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene, which explains the characteristic ¹H NMR pattern of two doublets, each for 2H.\n        *   It has the acidic proton, matching the signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:** The spectral data points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molar mass of the molecule with the most common isotopes. Since this is the base peak (100% relative abundance), we can assume the molar mass is 156 g/mol.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an abundance of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which simplifies to approximately 3:1.\n    *   This 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 is a classic isotopic signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom, because the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl. The molecule with ³⁵Cl has a mass of 156, and the molecule with ³⁷Cl has a mass of 158.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this extreme broadening.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with other protons and integrates to one proton ('1H').\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n        *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n        *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent to each other. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets. The downfield chemical shifts (7.72 and 8.02 ppm) indicate that both substituents on the ring are electron-withdrawing.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Has no carboxylic acid. Inconsistent with IR and NMR.\n    *   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would show an aldehyde proton (~10 ppm) but not a carboxylic acid proton (~11-12 ppm). The aromatic substitution pattern would also be different (3 protons, not 4, and a different splitting pattern). Inconsistent with IR and NMR.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a carboxylic acid, consistent with the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal. However, it is *ortho*-substituted. This would lead to four distinct aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR, not the simple two doublets observed.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n        *   **MS:** Has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂, Molar mass = 156.57 g/mol. Contains one chlorine atom. This matches the MS data.\n        *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid. This matches the IR data.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** It is a carboxylic acid, which explains the 11.0 ppm signal. It is *para*-substituted with two electron-withdrawing groups (-COOH and -Cl), which perfectly explains the NMR pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H. The protons ortho to the stronger electron-withdrawing group (-COOH) would be further downfield (8.02 ppm), and the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be slightly more shielded (7.72 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion:** All provided spectral data are fully consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis is a structural elucidation problem. I will analyze each piece of spectroscopic data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at **m/z = 156** represents the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a peak at **m/z = 158**, which is two mass units heavier. Its intensity is **32%** relative to the M⁺ peak (100%). This M⁺ to M⁺+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a definitive signature for the presence of a **single chlorine (Cl) atom** in the molecule. This is because chlorine's natural isotopes are ³⁵Cl (~75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~25% abundance), which have a mass difference of 2 amu and an abundance ratio of roughly 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules is responsible for this significant broadening.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This intense absorption falls in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is consistent with a carbonyl group that is part of a conjugated system, specifically an **aromatic carboxylic acid**.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n\n*   **Signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is highly diagnostic for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. Its integration confirms it represents a single proton (1H), and it appears as a singlet (s) because it typically does not couple with other protons. This provides strong confirmation for the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **Signals at 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):**\n    *   These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H, which indicates a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted)** benzene ring. Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent, and the two protons on the other side are also equivalent. These two sets of equivalent protons are adjacent and thus split each other's signal into a doublet.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**Synthesizing the Information and Evaluating the Options:**\n\nBased on the combined analysis, the unknown compound is a benzoic acid with a single chlorine atom attached at the *para* (4) position.\n\nLet's check the options:\n*   A) Phenyl chloroformate: Incorrect. This is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid.\n*   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, and the substitution pattern is wrong.\n*   C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Incorrect. While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would produce a more complex NMR splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **Correct**. This structure perfectly fits all the data: it has a molecular weight of 156.5 g/mol, contains one chlorine atom (MS), is a carboxylic acid (IR and NMR), and has a para-substitution pattern (NMR).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak). The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is characteristic of a compound containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes being roughly 3:1).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the options. All options (A, B, C, D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The nominal mass for this formula (using ¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl, ¹⁶O) is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + 35 + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the M+ peak. The M+2 peak at 158 corresponds to the molecule containing the ³⁷Cl isotope. So, the mass spectrometry data is consistent with all four options.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for a carbonyl group conjugated with an aromatic ring, as found in a benzoic acid derivative.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This evidence favors options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and C (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and rules out option B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acyl chloride) and option D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenol and an aldehyde group).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm region is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The signal is a singlet ('s') because this proton typically does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H'). This further confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid, narrowing the choices down to A and C.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum shows two signals in the aromatic region:\n        *   8.02 ppm (d, 2H)\n        *   7.72 ppm (d, 2H)\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The protons on each side of the ring are identical, and each has only one adjacent proton to couple with, resulting in a doublet.\n    *   Let's compare this with our remaining options:\n        *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) benzene ring. It has four unique aromatic protons, which would give a much more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n        *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. It has two sets of equivalent protons: the two protons ortho to the carboxylic acid group and the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom. This substitution pattern perfectly explains the observed 'two doublets of 2H each' splitting pattern. The more electron-withdrawing carboxyl group deshields the adjacent protons more, causing them to appear further downfield (at 8.02 ppm), while the protons adjacent to the chlorine atom appear slightly upfield (at 7.72 ppm).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The mass spectrum confirms the molecular formula and the presence of chlorine. The IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm confirm the carboxylic acid functional group. The splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the 1,4-(para) substitution on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unidentified compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at **m/z = 156** represents the molecular weight of the compound.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** A significant peak is observed at **m/z = 158** with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Isotopic Analysis:** The presence of a molecular ion peak (M+) and an M+2 peak with a height ratio of approximately 3:1 (100% to 32%) is a distinct isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom. The molecular weight of the options (all C7H5ClO2) with the ³⁵Cl isotope is approximately 156 g/mol.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. This strong evidence suggests the presence of a -COOH functional group.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When considered with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid. Conjugation to an aromatic ring can lower the frequency to this range.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The IR data strongly indicate the compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option A (an aldehyde/phenol) and option C (an acid chloride).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-12 ppm range is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The integration for one proton (1H) and its singlet nature (no adjacent protons to couple with) is fully consistent with this assignment.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   There are two signals in the aromatic region, one at 8.02 ppm and another at 7.72 ppm.\n    *   Both signals are doublets, meaning the protons they represent are each adjacent to only one other proton.\n    *   Each signal integrates to 2H, meaning there are two equivalent protons of each type.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic sign of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Remaining Options\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. It would show four distinct and more complex signals in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is a *para*-substituted benzene ring, which has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons adjacent to the carboxylic acid group equivalent and the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom equivalent. This leads to the exact ¹H NMR pattern observed: two doublets, each representing 2H. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group deshields the adjacent protons more, causing them to appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) compared to the protons adjacent to the chlorine (7.72 ppm).\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the combined evidence from Mass Spectrometry (chlorine present), IR spectroscopy (carboxylic acid), and ¹H NMR (carboxylic acid proton and a para-substituted aromatic ring), the only structure that fits all the data is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound with its most common isotopes.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** A peak is observed at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32%. This M+2 peak, having roughly one-third the intensity of the M+ peak, is a distinct isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156.5 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. A search confirms that the molecular formula for chlorobenzoic acid is C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This eliminates options B (an aldehyde) and D (a chloroformate ester).\n\n### 3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The chemical shift for this proton is often found above 10 ppm. Its integration as 1H confirms one such proton. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, points to a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. This symmetry means there are two distinct sets of aromatic protons.\n\n### 4. Structural Determination\n*   Based on the combined data, the unknown compound is a **chlorobenzoic acid**.\n*   The IR and NMR data confirm the carboxylic acid group.\n*   The MS data confirms the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   The ¹H NMR splitting pattern (two doublets) specifically indicates a **para** (1,4) substitution on the benzene ring.\n*   Comparing this with the options:\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure is a *para*-substituted chlorobenzoic acid, which perfectly matches all the spectral evidence. Published spectral data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid show very similar ¹H NMR shifts.\n    *   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Does not contain a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is *ortho*-substituted. The four aromatic protons would not be equivalent in pairs and would produce a more complex splitting pattern than two doublets.\n    *   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Is an ester and lacks the carboxylic acid group, which means it would not show the broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports the identification of the compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-p-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** The spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** A peak at **m/z = 158** is observed with an intensity that is 32% of the M⁺ peak. This M⁺/ (M+2) ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic pattern for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** All the proposed structures (Phenyl chloroformate, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, and 4-chlorobenzoic acid) share the same molecular formula: C₇H₅ClO₂. The calculated molecular weight for this formula, using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl, ¹⁶O), is 156.57 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\nThe mass spectrum confirms that the molecule has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and contains one chlorine atom, but it does not distinguish between the four isomers.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid** that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is indicative of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\nThis IR data strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate phenyl chloroformate (A), which is an acid chloride/ester and would lack the broad O-H peak, and 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (B), which is an aldehyde with a phenolic -OH. The IR of a phenolic -OH is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid. This narrows the possibilities down to the two carboxylic acid isomers: 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C) and 4-chlorobenzoic acid (D).\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal appearing this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) which is a singlet and integrates to one proton is definitive evidence of a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COOH). This further confirms that the unknown is either 2- or 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet signal integrating to two protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** Another doublet signal integrating to two protons.\n\nThis pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each accounting for two protons, indicates a high degree of symmetry in the benzene ring. Specifically, it points to a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, the protons at positions 2 and 6 are chemically equivalent, as are the protons at positions 3 and 5. This symmetry results in two signals, each representing two protons.\n\n*   **Evaluating the remaining options:**\n    *   **(C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. All four aromatic protons would be in unique chemical environments, leading to a more complex spectrum with four separate signals (or complex multiplets), each integrating to one proton. The ¹H NMR spectrum for 2-chlorobenzoic acid shows four distinct signals in the aromatic region.\n    *   **(D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *para*-substituted. Due to the plane of symmetry through carbons 1 and 4, the protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 are equivalent. This would produce exactly the pattern observed: two doublets, each integrating to 2H. Published spectra for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirm this pattern.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques, the unknown compound is identified as **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n*   **MS** established the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   **IR** identified the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n*   **¹H NMR** determined the substitution pattern on the aromatic ring to be para (1,4).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectral data.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectral Data**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   **Molecular Ion Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the molecule using the most abundant isotopes is 156 g/mol.\n    *   **Isotopic Pattern:** The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the main peak (a ratio of approximately 3:1) is a definitive signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**. This is due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl (≈75%) and ³⁷Cl (≈25%) isotopes.\n    *   **Careful Point:** All four options have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a nominal mass of 156, so the MS data confirms the molecular formula but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a textbook characteristic of an O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid**. The extreme broadness is a key feature.\n    *   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This is a characteristic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This IR data effectively eliminates options that are not carboxylic acids. Phenyl chloroformate (C) lacks an O-H group. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (B) is an aldehyde and a phenol; a phenol's O-H peak is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid. This narrows the possibilities down to the two chlorobenzoic acid isomers (A and D).\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** This region is the most crucial for determining the specific isomer. The pattern shows two signals, both are doublets (d), and each integrates to two protons (2H).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This highly symmetrical pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic indicator of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in two distinct signals. They are doublets because each set of protons is adjacent to, and thus split by, the other set.\n\n### **Evaluating the Options Based on the Original Question**\n\nLet's evaluate the options provided in the original question against our deductions:\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in a **para** (1,4) arrangement. This perfectly matches the IR data and the classic `two doublet, 2H each` pattern in the ¹H NMR. **This is a perfect match for all data.**\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Ruled out by IR and NMR as it is not a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** Ruled out by IR and NMR as it is not a carboxylic acid.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure is an **ortho** (1,2) isomer. While it is a carboxylic acid, it lacks the symmetry of the para isomer. Its four aromatic protons would be in four unique chemical environments, leading to a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum, not the simple pattern of two doublets.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe spectral data unambiguously points to a structure that is a carboxylic acid with a chlorine atom positioned para on the benzene ring. This corresponds to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. According to the original question's list, this is option A. The majority of the candidate answers correctly identified the structure as 4-chlorobenzoic acid through chemical analysis, even if their final letter choice was sometimes inconsistent due to re-ordering the options. The chemical reasoning is sound and points to one answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the most abundant isotope of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (deshielded) is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton, and its singlet (s) nature is expected as it does not couple with other protons.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is the classic pattern for a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the same for the two protons on the other side.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n*   From MS: MW = 156, contains one Cl atom.\n*   From IR: Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   From ¹H NMR: Contains a carboxylic acid proton and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** MW is correct, but the NMR would show three distinct aromatic protons and an aldehyde proton (~9-10 ppm), not a carboxylic acid proton at 11 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -Cl atom in the *para* position.\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ = (7*12) + (5*1) + 35.5 + (2*16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5. This matches.\n    *   **Functional Groups:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** It is *para*-substituted, which perfectly explains the two doublets (each 2H) in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum. This is a perfect match for all data.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** MW is correct and it is a carboxylic acid. However, being *ortho*-substituted, it would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** MW is correct, but it is an acid chloride/ester, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR peak at 11.0 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe spectral data is fully consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of about 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\nCombining these two features strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). Its integration as 1H confirms the presence of one such proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The two protons closer to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm) compared to the two protons closer to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This structure has an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. Its ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex and would not show the characteristic para-substitution pattern.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule's structure perfectly matches all the data.\n    *   **Formula (C₇H₅ClO₂):** The molecular weight is 156.57 g/mol.\n    *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid, consistent with the IR data.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** It has a *para*-substituted benzene ring, which would produce the two doublets seen in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The chemical shifts are also consistent with literature values for 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While this is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would lead to a more complex splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons in the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound lacks the hydroxyl group of a carboxylic acid, so it would not show the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ in the IR spectrum or the acidic proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral evidence unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound (using the most common isotope, ³⁵Cl) is 156 g/mol.\n*   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32 or 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   Conclusion from IR: The compound contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The 's' (singlet) indicates it has no adjacent protons, and '1H' confirms it's a single proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent equivalent.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options**\n*   **Summary:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156, contains one chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure is a para-substituted benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group. It perfectly matches all the data: MW of 156 (for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂), contains one Cl, has a carboxylic acid group, and would produce the para-substitution pattern (two doublets) in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** Lacks a carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is not a carboxylic acid. Also, its aromatic protons are all unique, which would lead to a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the ortho-substitution would make all four aromatic protons chemically distinct, leading to a complex spectrum, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only structure that fits all the provided spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the spectral data:\")\n    \n    # Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n    print(\"\\n1.

So, MW = 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative abundance of 32%. The M+ peak at m/z = 156 has a relative abundance of 100%.\n*   **Careful Point:** The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong indicator for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weights of the options:\n    *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   C) Phenyl chloroformate (C₂H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    All four options are isomers and are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic, extremely broad absorption that is the hallmark of an O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks (a very broad O-H and a C=O around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: An aldehyde and a phenol. Not a carboxylic acid. Eliminated.\n    *   C) Phenyl chloroformate: An acid chloride/ester derivative. It has no O-H group. Eliminated.\n    *   We are left with B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid, both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The integration for one proton (1H) and its singlet nature (no adjacent protons) confirm this assignment. Both remaining options (B and D) have this proton.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:** We have two signals in the aromatic region: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n*   **Careful Point:** The key to distinguishing between the remaining options lies in the symmetry and splitting pattern of the aromatic protons.\n    *   The spectrum shows only two types of aromatic protons.\n    *   Each signal is a doublet, meaning each type of proton has only one neighboring proton.\n    *   Each signal integrates to 2H, meaning there are two chemically equivalent protons of each type.\n*   **Analysis of Option B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   This is a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons ortho to the -COOH group are equivalent. The two protons ortho to the -Cl group are also equivalent.\n    *   This results in two sets of equivalent protons. The protons ortho to the -COOH will be a doublet (split by their one neighbor), and the protons ortho to the -Cl will also be a doublet (split by their one neighbor).\n    *   This predicted pattern (a doublet for 2H and another doublet for 2H) perfectly matches the experimental data. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded (8.02 ppm) than those ortho to the -Cl group (7.72 ppm).\n*   **Analysis of Option D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   This is an *ortho* (1,2) substituted benzene ring.\n    *   There is no symmetry that makes any of the four aromatic protons equivalent. All four are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Therefore, we would expect to see four distinct signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H, with more complex splitting (e.g., doublets, triplets, or doublets of doublets). This is inconsistent with the observed spectrum.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral data points unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular formula, the IR confirms the carboxylic acid functional group, and the ¹H NMR confirms the *para* substitution pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   An M+2 peak is observed at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a hallmark signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   All the proposed structures (A, B, C, D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The nominal mass for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 156 amu. The nominal mass for C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂ is (7×12) + (5×1) + 37 + (2×16) = 158 amu. Thus, all options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This evidence rules out option A (an aldehyde and an alcohol) and option D (a chloroformate, which is an ester derivative and lacks the O-H group). We are left with options B and C, which are both carboxylic acids.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** is in the highly deshielded region of the spectrum, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s) are consistent with this assignment.\n    *   The signals at **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** are in the aromatic region. The key information here is the splitting pattern and integration. We see two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H). This specific pattern is a classic indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para* compound makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in only two distinct signals. These two sets of protons split each other, creating two doublets.\n    *   Let's evaluate the remaining options based on this NMR data:\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a *para* substitution pattern (the -COOH and -Cl groups are at positions 1 and 4). This structure would produce the exact NMR spectrum described: one singlet for the acid proton and two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons.\n        *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has an *ortho* substitution pattern (groups at positions 1 and 2). This lack of symmetry would result in four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    By systematically analyzing all the spectral data, we can confidently identify the unknown compound. The MS data points to a chlorinated compound with a molecular weight of 156. The IR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR data confirms the carboxylic acid and, crucially, indicates a *para*-substituted benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of about 32% (approximately a 3:1 ratio with the M+ peak) is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom. This is due to the natural abundance of the chlorine isotopes ³⁵Cl (about 75%) and ³⁷Cl (about 25%).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this signal corresponds to the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The two different chemical shifts arise because the two substituents on the ring are different, making the chemically equivalent protons on each side of the ring magnetically distinct.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** The molecular weight (156.57 g/mol) is correct. However, its structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the characteristic broad O-H peak in the IR spectrum or the -COOH proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule's molecular weight is 156.57 g/mol, and it contains one chlorine atom, matching the MS data. As a carboxylic acid, its IR and ¹H NMR spectra would show the expected broad O-H stretch and the downfield -COOH proton signal, respectively. The *para* substitution pattern perfectly matches the two doublets seen in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** While the molecular weight is correct (156.57 g/mol), this compound is an aldehyde with a phenol group. It would not have a carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm. Its aromatic ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex, showing three distinct protons, not a simple two-doublet pattern.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This compound is a carboxylic acid with the correct molecular weight (156.57 g/mol). It would fit the IR and the carboxylic acid portion of the NMR data. However, the *ortho* substitution would result in a complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region with four unique proton signals, which contradicts the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectral data—a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom, the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, and a *para*-substituted aromatic ring—unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** A significant peak is observed at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ and M+2 pattern, with a ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32), is a distinctive indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom. This is due to the natural isotopic abundance of chlorine: ³⁵Cl (≈75%) and ³⁷Cl (≈25%). The M+ peak corresponds to the molecule containing ³⁵Cl, and the M+2 peak corresponds to the molecule containing ³⁷Cl.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. The molecular formula for all the options is C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests it belongs to a carboxylic acid. Aromatic carboxylic acids typically show a C=O stretch in the 1710-1680 cm⁻¹ range.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option D (Phenyl chloroformate), which is an ester and would not show the broad O-H stretch, and option B (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), which is an aldehyde and a phenol.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its chemical shift is high due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent carbonyl group and hydrogen bonding. It appears as a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The presence of signals between 7.0 and 8.5 ppm indicates an aromatic ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a doublet, meaning the protons are coupled to one neighboring proton. It integrates to two protons, indicating two chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This is also a doublet integrating to two protons.\n*   **Aromatic Substitution Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic sign of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry equivalent to the two on the other side. The protons at 8.02 ppm are likely *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, which deshields them significantly. The protons at 7.72 ppm are *ortho* to the chlorine atom.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Final Candidates\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This would have a 1,2-disubstitution pattern. Due to the lack of symmetry, it would show four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data:\n    *   **MS:** Molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ (MW ≈ 156.57 g/mol) with one chlorine atom.\n    *   **IR:** Contains a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Shows a carboxylic acid proton and the characteristic two-doublet pattern for a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectral data collectively and unequivocally identify the unknown compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the spectral data provided, a reasoned structural suggestion for the unidentified white solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Here is a breakdown of how the evidence supports this conclusion:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound. The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158, with an intensity about one-third of the main peak (32%), is a classic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom. All the proposed options have a molecular formula of C7H5ClO2, which corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, and all contain chlorine.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows two key features. First, a very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding. Second, the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid. This evidence strongly points towards a carboxylic acid, effectively ruling out phenyl chloroformate (which lacks an O-H group) and making 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde less likely, as a phenolic O-H stretch is usually less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:** The ¹H NMR data provides the most definitive evidence for the specific isomer.\n    *   The singlet at a downfield shift of 11.0 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The aromatic region of the spectrum shows two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, with each signal integrating to two protons (2H). This specific pattern—two doublets of equal integration—is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   Combining these observations, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits perfectly. It is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene with a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom. 2-chlorobenzoic acid, being 1,2-disubstituted, would produce a more complex splitting pattern for its four unique aromatic protons.\n\nTherefore, the combination of all three spectroscopic techniques unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak. This M⁺ to M⁺+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a definitive indicator of the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic, unmistakable signal for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration for one proton (1H) and its singlet (s) nature confirm this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent, leading to this simplified splitting pattern. The protons at 8.02 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the protons at 7.72 ppm are ortho to the chlorine atom.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group attached to a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n### 4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound is a **chlorinated benzoic acid** with a **para substitution pattern**. Let's check the proposed structures:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, and the NMR substitution pattern would be different (1,2,3-trisubstituted).\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **This structure fits all the data perfectly.**\n    *   **Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂\n    *   **MW:** 156.5 g/mol (matches MS).\n    *   **Functional Group:** Contains a carboxylic acid (matches IR and NMR).\n    *   **Substitution:** It is a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring (matches NMR splitting pattern).\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. This is an ortho-substituted ring, which would result in a more complex NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR and the acidic proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the NMR.\n\nThe evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound, using the most abundant isotopes, is 156 amu.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes: ~75% ³⁵Cl and ~25% ³⁷Cl).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula for the proposed structures. All options (A, B, C, D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   The molecular weight for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   The molecular weight for C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂ is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158.\n    *   The MS data is consistent with a compound of formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules (dimerization).\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is typical for a carbonyl group that is part of a conjugated system, such as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   This IR data strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This eliminates option B (Phenyl chloroformate, which lacks an O-H group) and option D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenolic O-H and an aldehyde C=O, but not the characteristic super-broad O-H of a carboxylic acid). We are left with options A and C, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton, and its singlet nature (s) is expected as it does not couple with other protons. This further confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The key information is the splitting pattern and integration. We have two signals, each a doublet (d), and each representing two protons (2H). This simple pattern indicates a high degree of symmetry in the benzene ring. A *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring has a plane of symmetry that makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. This leads to a pattern of two doublets, exactly as observed.\n    *   Let's compare the remaining options:\n        *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. It would show two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. This perfectly matches the observed NMR spectrum. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n        *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. It has no such symmetry. All four aromatic protons are in chemically different environments and would give rise to four separate, more complex signals (e.g., doublets of doublets, triplets), not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    All pieces of spectral evidence point to a single structure. The MS shows a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal confirm a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of the NMR shows a simple two-doublet pattern, which is characteristic of a *para*-substituted benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all of these criteria.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75.8%, and ³⁷Cl is ~24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and its position is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H').\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The presence of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is a classic pattern for a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. This pattern arises from the symmetry of the molecule, where the two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. It would not produce the simple two-doublet pattern seen in the ¹H NMR. The four aromatic protons would be unique, leading to a more complex spectrum.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule is an ester/acid chloride. It lacks the carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the broad O-H peak in the IR or the proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MS:** The molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the MS data.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, which matches the IR data perfectly.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It is a *para*-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group. This structure would produce a signal for the carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm) and the characteristic two-doublet pattern for the four aromatic protons. This is a perfect match for all the spectral data.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have a proton signal at 11.0 ppm. The aldehyde proton would appear around 9-10 ppm. The aromatic region would show three signals for the three protons, not two signals for four protons.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of evidence point conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weight of the options, all of which are isomers with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   MW = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 35 + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   All options match the molecular weight and the presence of one chlorine atom. We must use the other spectral data to differentiate them.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very distinctive feature. A very broad absorption in this region is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids:\n    *   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. Ruled out.\n    *   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester/acid chloride derivative. It lacks the O-H group for the broad peak. Ruled out.\n    *   We are left with **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** and **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**, both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**). The 's' indicates it is a singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with), and '1H' confirms it represents a single proton. This is consistent with both remaining options (B and D).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The pattern in the aromatic region is the key to distinguishing between the remaining isomers.\n    *   We see two signals: a doublet at 8.02 ppm integrating to 2H, and another doublet at 7.72 ppm integrating to 2H.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic signature of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. Due to the symmetry of the para-substitution, there are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to one substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   **Let's analyze the remaining options:**\n        *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho* (1,2) substituted ring. The four aromatic protons would all be in different chemical environments, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four distinct signals), not two simple doublets.\n        *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para* (1,4) substituted ring. This substitution pattern perfectly matches the observed NMR data of two doublets, each for 2H. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom appear slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll three pieces of spectral data are consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **MS:** MW of 156 and one Cl atom.\n*   **IR:** Confirms a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, crucially, the *para* substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nTherefore, the unidentified solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158, with an intensity of about one-third (32%) of the M+ peak, is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (A, B, C, and D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with this data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, it aligns well with the C=O stretch of an aromatic carboxylic acid (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This evidence makes options C (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid) the most likely candidates, while ruling out A (an aldehyde with a regular alcohol -OH) and B (a chloroformate with no -OH group).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield and appearing as a singlet is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm) is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The ring has two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm). Each set appears as a doublet because they are splitting each other.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The singlet at 11.0 ppm confirms the carboxylic acid. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, confirms a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   **Option A (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde):** Inconsistent with the very broad IR peak and the NMR data.\n*   **Option B (Phenyl chloroformate):** Inconsistent with IR and NMR data (no O-H group).\n*   **Option D (2-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. It would show a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, with four distinct signals for the four non-equivalent aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **Option C (4-chlorobenzoic acid):** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data. It has the correct mass and chlorine isotope pattern. The IR data matches a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR shows a carboxylic acid proton and the characteristic *para*-substitution pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region.\n\nTherefore, the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the provided spectral data, the unidentified white solid is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. Here is a breakdown of how the evidence supports this conclusion:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂).\n    *   The peak at m/z = 158, which is approximately one-third the intensity of the molecular ion peak, is the characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad peak observed between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is definitive for the O-H bond stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at a very downfield chemical shift of 11.0 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, one at 8.02 ppm (2H) and one at 7.72 ppm (2H), indicates a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield, while the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are slightly upfield. This specific pattern strongly supports the 4-chloro (or para) substitution.\n\n### Evaluation of Other Options:\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct molecular weight, its ¹H NMR spectrum would be much more complex than two simple doublets due to the ortho-substitution pattern.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR spectrum and the acidic proton signal around 11 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This compound is an aldehyde with a phenolic hydroxyl group. It would not show the characteristic broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal for a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of its NMR spectrum would also be different, showing three distinct protons with complex splitting.\n\nTherefore, the combination of all spectral data points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the correct structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified compound is identified as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectral Data:**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound.\n    *   The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of approximately 32% is a classic M+2 isotope pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom. The natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is roughly 76% ³⁵Cl and 24% ³⁷Cl, leading to an M+/(M+2) peak ratio of about 3:1. This confirms the molecular formula contains one chlorine atom and the molecular weight is 156 g/mol.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with the carbonyl group in an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at a significant downfield shift of 11.0 ppm, integrating to one proton (1H), is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The two signals in the aromatic region, a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H), suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The symmetry of a 1,4-disubstituted ring results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, each appearing as a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent proton. This pattern is a hallmark of para-substitution. Published spectral data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirm these chemical shifts.\n\n### **Evaluation of Alternatives:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct molecular weight, the ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex, showing four distinct signals in the aromatic region due to the lack of symmetry.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound lacks the hydroxyl group necessary for the broad IR peak and the acidic proton seen at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This structure is inconsistent with the ¹H NMR data, as it would show an aldehyde proton (around 9-10 ppm) and a different, more complex aromatic splitting pattern. It also lacks a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined evidence from Mass Spectrometry, IR Spectroscopy, and ¹H NMR Spectroscopy unequivocally points to the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound (using the most common isotopes) is 156 g/mol.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ / (M+2) ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single **chlorine** atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and very strong indicator of the O-H stretching vibration within a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (δ > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a highly deshielded proton. This chemical shift, combined with the integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s), is definitive for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid** (-COO**H**).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-substitution means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and they split each other into doublets. The downfield position of these protons indicates they are attached to a ring with electron-withdrawing groups.\n\n**Putting It All Together**\n\n1.  From the MS, we know the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n2.  From the IR and ¹H NMR, we know the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n3.  From the ¹H NMR, we know there is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n\nLet's assemble the pieces: we have a benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group attached at the 1 and 4 positions. This structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**Let's check 4-chlorobenzoic acid (Option D) against the data:**\n\n*   **Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂\n*   **Molecular Weight:** (7×12) + (5×1) + (1×35.5) + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5. This matches the m/z of 156.\n*   **MS:** Contains one Cl atom. Matches.\n*   **IR:** Is an aromatic carboxylic acid. Matches.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Has a carboxylic acid proton and a para-substituted ring. Matches perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable structural suggestion is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peaks:** The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion (M+) peak at m/z = 156 and another peak (M+2) at m/z = 158.\n*   **Isotopic Abundance:** The ratio of the intensities of these peaks is 100% to 32% (approximately 3:1). This M+ and M+2 pattern is a distinct signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, corresponding to its two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (24.2% abundance).\n*   **Molecular Weight:** The molecular weight of the compound containing the ³⁵Cl isotope is 156 g/mol.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n### 3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly indicative of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its integration as one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (due to rapid chemical exchange and no adjacent protons to couple with) confirm this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indication of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two equivalent sets. The downfield doublet at 8.02 ppm corresponds to the two protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the slightly more upfield doublet at 7.72 ppm corresponds to the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom. Published spectral data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid show similar chemical shifts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the combined evidence:\n\n1.  **Mass Spec** confirms a molecular formula containing one chlorine atom with a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope).\n2.  **IR** confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n3.  **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid proton and indicates a *para*-substituted aromatic ring.\n\nEvaluating the given options:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Inconsistent with the IR (not a carboxylic acid) and the NMR splitting pattern.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* substitution would produce a more complex splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons in the NMR, not two doublets of 2H each.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** The structure perfectly matches all spectral data. Its molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is (7*12)+(5*1)+35.5+(2*16) = 156.5 g/mol. It is a carboxylic acid, consistent with the IR spectrum. It has a *para*-substituted ring, which would give the observed 2H doublet + 2H doublet pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Inconsistent with the IR (no broad O-H) and NMR (no acidic proton, different aromatic pattern).\n\nThe spectral information strongly and consistently points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This tells us the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes is 156 amu.\n    *   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158, which is about 32% of the height of the M+ peak (100%). A M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a definitive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (since the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75% and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options (using C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35):\n        *   A) C₇H₅ClO₂: (7\\*12) + (5\\*1) + (35) + (2\\*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. (Matches)\n        *   B) C₇H₅ClO₂: (7\\*12) + (5\\*1) + (35) + (2\\*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. (Matches)\n        *   C) C₇H₅ClO₂: (7\\*12) + (5\\*1) + (35) + (2\\*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. (Matches)\n        *   D) C₇H₅ClO₂: (7\\*12) + (5\\*1) + (35) + (2\\*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. (Matches)\n    *   All options have the correct molecular formula and weight. The MS data confirms the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid carbonyl.\n    *   This combination strongly suggests the molecule is a carboxylic acid. This rules out option A (aldehyde/phenol) and option D (phenyl chloroformate, which is an acyl chloride/ester hybrid and would lack the broad O-H peak).\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, which is the typical region for a carboxylic acid proton. The integration of 1H (one proton) and its multiplicity as a singlet (s, no adjacent protons) confirms the -COOH group.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The remaining signals are in the aromatic region. We have a total of 4 aromatic protons (2H + 2H). The benzene ring must be di-substituted.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The pattern shows two doublets (d), each representing two protons. This symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons adjacent to one substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   This NMR data points directly to a para-substituted structure.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Remaining Options:**\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is a carboxylic acid with a chlorine atom at the para (4) position. This structure perfectly matches all the data:\n        *   MS: Correct molecular weight and has one Cl.\n        *   IR: Has a carboxylic acid group.\n        *   ¹H NMR: Has a carboxylic acid proton and a para-substituted ring pattern.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted molecule. While it's a carboxylic acid, its four aromatic protons would not be symmetrical and would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR, not two simple doublets of 2H each.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the combined spectral evidence, the only structure that fits all the data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectral data to identify the correct chemical structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n    # M+ peak at m/z=156 indicates a molecular weight of 156.\n    # The M+2 peak at m/z=158 with 32% intensity (a ~3:1 ratio with M+) is a classic sign of one Chlorine atom.\n    # All four options have the formula C7H5ClO2 and a molecular weight of 156, so all are initially possible.\n\n    # IR Spectroscopy Analysis\n    # A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 is characteristic of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    # A strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    # This evidence strongly suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid, which rules out:\n    # A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde)\n    # D) Phenyl chloroformate (an acyl chloride/ester)\n\n    # 1H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\n    # The signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H) is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    # The signals at 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H) are in the aromatic region.\n    # The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, indicates a symmetrically 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    # Let's check the remaining options against this NMR data:\n    # B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This is a para-substituted benzoic acid.

This is a classic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine (Cl) atom in the molecule. The natural abundances of chlorine isotopes are approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is located in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (which lowers the frequency from a typical non-conjugated value of ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (>10 ppm):** A signal this far downfield is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Confirms it is a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** Expected, as this proton is not adjacent to any other protons.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7-8.5 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region, indicating they are protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Integration (2H each):** There are two sets of two chemically equivalent protons. This means the benzene ring has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** Each signal is a doublet, meaning each set of protons is coupled to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This specific pattern—two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons—is a classic fingerprint for a **para-disubstituted** (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two substituents are different, causing the two sets of protons to have different chemical shifts.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options**\n*   From **MS**, we know the compound has MW = 156 and contains one Cl atom.\n*   From **IR** and **¹H NMR**, we know it contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   From **¹H NMR**, we know it has a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nCombining these facts, the structure must be a benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in the *para* (1,4) positions.

Correct.\n    *   Is a carboxylic acid. Correct.\n    *   Is *para*-disubstituted, which matches the NMR pattern. Correct. This is a perfect match.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** No carboxylic acid group. Incorrect.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid (NMR peak at 11.0 ppm rules this out). The aromatic NMR pattern would be much more complex (three different protons). Incorrect.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-disubstituted ring. It would have four non-equivalent aromatic protons, leading to a complex NMR splitting pattern, not two doublets of 2H each. Incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** All spectral data points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion (M⁺) peak is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   A peak at m/z = 158 (M⁺+2) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak (100%) is observed. This ~3:1 ratio for M⁺:(M⁺+2) is the characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula for the proposed structures. All options (A, B, C, D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl) is: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. This matches the M⁺ peak. The MS data confirms the molecular formula and the presence of one chlorine atom but doesn't distinguish between the isomers.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The spectrum shows a very broad peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This is the classic signature of an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid dimerized through hydrogen bonding.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This frequency is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, specifically an aryl carboxylic acid (conjugated carbonyl).\n    *   The combination of these two features is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. This allows us to eliminate option A (phenyl chloroformate, which is an acid chloride/ester) and option D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which is an aldehyde and a phenol). This leaves us with options B (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and C (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n*   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Signal at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is in the typical chemical shift range (10-13 ppm) for a carboxylic acid proton. Its high deshielding is characteristic. It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with nearby protons and integrates to one proton ('1H'). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **Signals at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern is crucial for determining the substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n        *   We see two signals, each a doublet ('d'), and each integrating to two protons ('2H'). This symmetrical pattern indicates a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are only two sets of chemically equivalent protons, and each set splits the other into a doublet.\n        *   Let's analyze the remaining options:\n            *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho* (1,2) substituted ring. All four aromatic protons would be chemically non-equivalent, leading to four distinct and more complex signals (not two simple doublets).\n            *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para* (1,4) substituted ring. It possesses the required symmetry to produce two doublets, each for two protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom appear slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combined spectral data points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular formula and presence of chlorine, the IR confirms the carboxylic acid group, and the ¹H NMR confirms the *para* substitution pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo identify the unknown white solid, we must analyze the provided spectral data and compare it with the structures of the possible options.\n\n### Analysis of Spectral Data:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   A molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n    *   The presence of a peak at **m/z = 158** with a relative intensity of about 32% (M+2 peak) is a strong indicator of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, due to the natural isotopic abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl (approximately 3:1 ratio).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the options: The chemical formula for all four options is C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   A **strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This combination of peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates option A (aldehyde and hydroxyl) and option B (chloroformate, which would lack the broad O-H peak).\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in this region (typically 10-13 ppm) that is a singlet and integrates to one proton is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule is an aldehyde with a hydroxyl group. It would not have the characteristic carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum or the specific broad IR peak of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester-like molecule (an acid chloride). It lacks the acidic proton and therefore would not show a signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR or the broad O-H stretch in the IR spectrum.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MS:** It contains chlorine and has the correct molecular weight.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR data perfectly.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It has a carboxylic acid proton (matches 11.0 ppm signal) and a *para*-substituted ring, which would produce two doublets for the aromatic protons. The protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons adjacent to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm). This matches the data exactly.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MS and IR:** As a chlorobenzoic acid isomer, it matches the mass and IR data.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Although it has the carboxylic acid proton, its *ortho* (1,2) substitution pattern on the benzene ring would create a more complex splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons, not two simple doublets integrating to 2H each.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe combined evidence from mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, and ¹H NMR spectroscopy points unequivocally to **4-chlorobenzoic acid** as the identity of the unknown compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158 with about one-third the intensity (32%) of the M+ peak is a classic sign of a single chlorine atom. Chlorine has two common isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, in an approximate 3:1 natural abundance, which leads to this characteristic M+ and M+2 peak pattern.\n*   All the proposed molecules (A, B, C, and D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, consistent with the MS data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   This combination strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group. Options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) contain this functional group. Option C (Phenyl chloroformate) is an ester and would lack the broad O-H peak. Option D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) has a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde group, which would show different IR absorptions.\n\n### 3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is almost exclusively due to a carboxylic acid proton. The integration of one proton (1H) confirms this assignment. This further supports options A and B.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, indicates a symmetrically 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Option A (2-chlorobenzoic acid):** This ortho-substituted ring would produce a more complex splitting pattern with four distinct aromatic proton signals.\n    *   **Option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid):** This para-substituted ring has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons adjacent to the -COOH group equivalent and the two protons adjacent to the -Cl group equivalent. This leads to the observed pattern of two doublets. NMR data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirms two aromatic signals around 7.5-8.0 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectral data points conclusively to **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n*   **MS** confirms the molecular weight of 156 g/mol and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   **IR** confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, crucially, the *para* substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe provided spectral data allows for a clear determination of the unknown compound's structure. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of about one-third (32%) is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing a single chlorine atom. The molecular weight of all possible answers is approximately 156.5 g/mol, consistent with this finding.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows a very broad absorption band in the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ region, which is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. Furthermore, the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid. This combination strongly suggests the presence of a -COOH group, pointing toward either 2-chlorobenzoic acid or 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm, integrating to one proton (1H), is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.\n    *   The aromatic region displays a simple pattern of two doublets: one at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another at 7.72 ppm (2H). This pattern indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring results in two sets of equivalent protons, which appear as two doublets. 2-chlorobenzoic acid, being ortho-substituted, would produce a more complex splitting pattern.\n    *   Therefore, the NMR data is uniquely consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the combined evidence from Mass Spectrometry (chlorine presence), IR spectroscopy (carboxylic acid functional group), and ¹H NMR (para-substituted aromatic ring), the unknown compound is identified as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is ~75% ³⁵Cl and ~25% ³⁷Cl.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (containing ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is part of an aromatic system.\n    *   Together, these two peaks are definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, in the typical region for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet ('s') because this proton is not typically coupled to other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H'). This confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). There are a total of 4 aromatic protons (2H + 2H). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. In this pattern, the two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent, and the two protons on the other side are also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two distinct doublets.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the very broad IR peak and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.

The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 156. This matches the MS data, including the M+2 peak for the chlorine isotope.\n        *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, which matches the IR spectrum perfectly.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** It is a para-substituted benzene ring, which would produce the observed pattern of two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons. It also has the carboxylic acid proton that appears at 11.0 ppm. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted ring. While it is a carboxylic acid and has the correct molecular weight, the 4 aromatic protons would have a much more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR, not two simple doublets. Incorrect.\n    *   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR and the -COOH proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.

The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in this simple A₂B₂ or AA'BB' splitting pattern.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzoic acid.

Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, with a relative intensity of 32% compared to the M⁺ peak (100%), gives a ratio of approximately 3:1. This M⁺/M⁺+2 ratio is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and very distinctive feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The significant broadness is caused by extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When observed along with the very broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid** functional group. A conjugated aromatic carboxylic acid typically absorbs in the 1725-1700 cm⁻¹ range.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically in the 10-13 ppm range) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration (1H) confirms it is a single proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region, indicating a substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The total integration of 4H (2H + 2H) means the ring is disubstituted.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each representing two equivalent protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This high degree of symmetry results in only two types of aromatic protons, which couple with each other to form doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule consists of a para-disubstituted benzene ring attached to a carboxylic acid group.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   The combined data indicates that the unknown compound is a chlorobenzoic acid with a para substitution pattern.\n\n*   Let's evaluate the given options:\n\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n        *   **Structure:** It has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in a 1,4 (para) arrangement on a benzene ring. This matches the ¹H NMR pattern.\n        *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid, which matches the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal.\n        *   **Molecular Weight:** The formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The mass for the ³⁵Cl isotope is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 156. This matches the MS data.\n        *   This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data.\n\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted isomer. Its four unique aromatic protons would give a much more complex NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n    *   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have the characteristic IR and NMR signals for a carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride and lacks an O-H group. It would not show the broad IR peak or the acidic proton signal in the NMR.\n\nThe evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the nominal molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a classic isotopic signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options. All options (Phenyl chloroformate, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-chlorobenzoic acid) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Let's calculate the nominal mass: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the M+ peak. The MS data confirms the molecular formula contains one chlorine atom and is consistent with all the given options.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding dimers.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid carbonyl.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   This finding eliminates option A (Phenyl chloroformate, which is an ester/acid chloride and would lack the broad O-H peak) and option C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenolic O-H and an aldehyde C=O, but the combination of the very broad O-H and the NMR data points away from this). We are left with options B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet because it does not typically couple with other protons. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). We have a total of 4 aromatic protons. The key information is the splitting pattern and integration. We see two signals, each being a doublet and each integrating to two protons. This symmetrical pattern is a hallmark of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two protons ortho to one group equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other group equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   Let's compare this to the remaining options:\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. It would exhibit the exact symmetrical pattern of two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would deshield the ortho protons (likely the 8.02 ppm signal), while the protons ortho to the chlorine would be at a slightly different chemical shift (likely the 7.72 ppm signal). This is a perfect match.\n        *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. There is no plane of symmetry that makes protons equivalent. All four aromatic protons are in chemically distinct environments. This would result in a much more complex spectrum, likely with four separate signals (e.g., multiplets), not two simple doublets. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data points unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the mass and presence of chlorine. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal confirm the carboxylic acid group. The symmetrical aromatic pattern in the NMR (two doublets, 2H each) confirms the *para* substitution pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nBased on the spectral information, the most reasonable structure for the unidentified compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. Here is a detailed analysis of why this structure is the correct choice:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound. The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is about one-third the intensity of the main peak, is a classic isotopic signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes). 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂) has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, which is consistent with this data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows two key features. First, an extremely broad absorption between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. Second, the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at a very downfield chemical shift of 11.0 ppm is indicative of a highly acidic proton, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   The aromatic region displays two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, with each signal integrating to two protons (2H). This symmetrical pattern of two doublets is a hallmark of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The protons next to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm) compared to the protons next to the chlorine atom.\n\n### Evaluation of Other Options:\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it matches the molecular weight and IR data, its *ortho*-substitution pattern would produce a more complex and asymmetric set of signals in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This compound lacks a carboxylic acid, so it would not show a proton signal around 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR, nor the very broad O-H stretch characteristic of a carboxylic acid in the IR spectrum.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule lacks an O-H group entirely, which is inconsistent with the IR spectrum. It also does not have a carboxylic acid proton, which contradicts the ¹H NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data, the unknown compound is identified as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of approximately 32% are characteristic of a compound with a molecular weight of 156 containing one chlorine atom. All the proposed structures have a molecular weight of 156.57 g/mol and contain a single chlorine atom, making them consistent with this data.\n\n*   **IR Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows a very broad absorption band in the range of 3500-2700 cm⁻¹, which is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. Additionally, the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of the carboxylic acid. This combination of peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, effectively ruling out 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and phenol) and phenyl chloroformate (an ester). Both 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid are consistent with this data.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:** The proton NMR spectrum provides the most definitive evidence for the specific isomer.\n    *   The singlet at a very downfield chemical shift of 11.0 ppm is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The aromatic region displays two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, with each signal integrating to two protons (2H). This pattern is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry in a para-substituted ring results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, which split each other to produce two doublets.\n    *   4-chlorobenzoic acid fits this pattern perfectly. The protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear as a doublet at 8.02 ppm, while the protons adjacent (ortho) to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded and appear as a doublet at 7.72 ppm.\n    *   In contrast, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, being a 1,2-disubstituted ring, would show a more complex splitting pattern with four distinct signals for the aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combined spectral data—particularly the classic para-substituted pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum—unambiguously points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the correct structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified white solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Here is a detailed breakdown of how the data supports this conclusion:\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound. The molecular formula for 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C₇H₅ClO₂, and its molecular weight is approximately 156.57 g/mol. This is consistent with the observed molecular ion peak.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, with an abundance of about one-third of the M+ peak (32%), is a definitive indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom. Chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with natural abundances of approximately 75.8% and 24.2%, respectively. This leads to a characteristic M:(M+2) peak ratio of roughly 3:1 for chlorinated compounds.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is indicative of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a conjugated aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n### **3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** The singlet appearing far downfield is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its high chemical shift is due to the strong deshielding effect of the adjacent carbonyl group.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two equivalent sets. The set closer to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group is more deshielded and thus appears further downfield (8.02 ppm). The set closer to the chlorine atom appears slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm). Literature data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirms similar chemical shifts for these protons.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll three spectroscopic methods provide complementary evidence that points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The other options are inconsistent with the provided data:\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Would have a more complex NMR splitting pattern in the aromatic region.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Would not show a carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm in the NMR spectrum, and the IR O-H stretch would differ.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Lacks the carboxylic acid group and therefore would not show the characteristic broad O-H stretch in the IR or the -COOH proton in the NMR.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is at **m/z = 156**. This represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at **m/z = 158** with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak (100%). This M⁺ to M+2 ratio of approximately 100:32 (or ~3:1) is a distinct isotopic pattern indicating the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl have a natural abundance ratio of roughly 3:1).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options:\n        *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = 156.57 g/mol.\n        *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = 156.57 g/mol.\n        *   C) Phenyl chloroformate (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = 156.57 g/mol.\n        *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = 156.57 g/mol.\n    *   All four options have the correct molecular weight and contain one chlorine atom. The MS data is consistent with all of them.\n\n2.  **Infrared Spectroscopy (IR):**\n    *   A **very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A **strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This value falls squarely in the range for a carboxylic acid carbonyl (~1725-1700 cm⁻¹).\n    *   This combination of peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This eliminates options **C** (which is a chloroformate, lacking an O-H group) and **D** (which has an aldehyde C=O and a phenol O-H, whose O-H stretch is typically narrower than that of a carboxylic acid). We are left with options A and B.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR):**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, in the region characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. The integration of 1H confirms this assignment.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   Let's compare this NMR data with the remaining options:\n        *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted (1,2-disubstituted) ring. It would have four non-equivalent aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four distinct multiplets), not two simple doublets.\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) ring. It has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom. This structure would produce exactly the observed NMR spectrum:\n            *   One singlet for the carboxylic acid proton (~11.0 ppm).\n            *   Two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group would be more deshielded (the 8.02 ppm peak), and the protons ortho to the -Cl group would be slightly less deshielded (the 7.72 ppm peak).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll three pieces of spectral data point unambiguously to **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. It has the correct molecular weight and chlorine isotope pattern (MS), the characteristic peaks for a carboxylic acid (IR), and the specific NMR pattern for a para-substituted aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid proton (¹H NMR).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nBased on the spectral data provided, the unidentified compound is **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**. Here is a step-by-step analysis that supports this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound. The formula for 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C₇H₅ClO₂ which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, consistent with this peak.\n    *   The peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of about 32% to the main peak is the M+2 peak. The 3:1 ratio of the M+ to M+2 peaks is a distinct isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom.\n    *   All four options have the same molecular formula and would produce these peaks.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad peak observed between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   This combination strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), which effectively rules out options C (phenyl chloroformate) and D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), leaving A and B as the most likely candidates.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This singlet far downfield is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. Its signal is often broad, but being a singlet is expected as it does not have adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region is the key to determining the exact isomer. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, indicates a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring is symmetrically substituted. The two protons next to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are chemically equivalent, as are the two protons next to the chlorine atom. This symmetry results in two signals, each representing two protons. Their proximity to each other causes them to appear as doublets.\n    *   In contrast, 2-chlorobenzoic acid (option B) has four unique aromatic protons and would show a much more complex spectrum with four separate signals in the aromatic region.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined data from MS, IR, and ¹H NMR all consistently point to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular weight and the presence of chlorine. The IR confirms the carboxylic acid functional group. The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, most definitively, the *para* substitution pattern on the aromatic ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is my step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol (using the most common isotope, ³⁵Cl).\n*   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of about 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This ~3:1 ratio of M+ to M+2 is a classic isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule (since the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75% and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n*   All four options (C₇H₅ClO₂) have a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with this finding.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, where the broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This specific frequency falls nicely within the range for a carboxylic acid's carbonyl group.\n*   Conclusion from IR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates options C (phenyl chloroformate) and D (aldehyde), as they do not have a carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is the defining peak for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It's a singlet because it typically does not couple with other protons. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons (for a total of four aromatic protons), is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution results in only two unique types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Remaining Options**\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted (1,2-disubstituted) ring. Due to the lack of symmetry, it would produce a more complex splitting pattern for its four aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) ring. This structure has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom. It perfectly matches all the data:\n    *   It contains one Cl atom (MS).\n    *   It is a carboxylic acid (IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR peak).\n    *   It is para-substituted, which would give two doublets in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nBased on the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectral data to identify an unknown compound from a list of options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Provided Data\n    mass_spec = {\n        'm/z=156': '100% (M+ peak)',\n        'm/z=158': '32% (M+2 peak)'\n    }\n    ir_spec = {\n        '3500-2700 cm-1': 'broad peak',\n        '1720 cm-1': 'strong sharp peak'\n    }\n    nmr_spec = {\n        '11.0 ppm': 'singlet, 1H',\n        '8.02 ppm': 'doublet, 2H',\n        '7.72 ppm': 'doublet, 2H'\n    }\n\n    # Options\n    options = {\n        'A': '2-chlorobenzoic acid',\n        'B': '4-chlorobenzoic acid',\n        'C': 'Phenyl chloroformate',\n        'D': '3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-Step Analysis:\")\n    \n    # --- Analysis ---\n    print(\"\\n1.

The natural abundances of chlorine isotopes are approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl, which gives an expected M+ to M+2 peak ratio of about 3:1 (or 100%:33%). The observed ratio of 100%:32% is a perfect match.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch around 1720 cm⁻¹ in conjunction with the broad O-H stretch is definitive for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, a region characteristic of highly acidic protons. The chemical shift, singlet multiplicity (no adjacent protons), and integration (1H) are all perfectly consistent with the proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** Both of these signals are in the chemical shift range for aromatic protons (protons on a benzene ring).\n*   **Splitting Pattern and Integration (8.02 ppm, doublet, 2H; 7.72 ppm, doublet, 2H):**\n    *   The total integration in this region is 2H + 2H = 4H. This indicates a disubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para arrangement leads to two sets of chemically equivalent protons, each appearing as a doublet due to splitting by its neighbor.\n    *   The downfield shift (to 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm) indicates both substituents on the ring are electron-withdrawing.

The calculated molecular weight for C₇H₅ClO₂ (the molecular formula for all options) is 156 g/mol, which matches the data.\n\n2.  **IR Spectroscopy:** The very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid dimer. The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring. This evidence points to the molecule being a carboxylic acid, thus eliminating phenyl chloroformate (B) and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D).\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H) is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H) in the aromatic region are characteristic of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.

Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound with its most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** A peak is observed at m/z = 158. The mass difference of 2 units (158 - 156) and the relative intensity ratio of the M+2 peak to the M+ peak (32%, which is approximately 1:3) is a characteristic pattern for a molecule containing one chlorine atom. This is due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (4-chlorobenzoic acid, phenyl chloroformate, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, and 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight that matches this data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded, typically as a dimer.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of the extremely broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This makes 4-chlorobenzoic acid (A) and 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C) the most likely candidates. Phenyl chloroformate (B) lacks the O-H group, and its carbonyl stretch would be at a higher frequency. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D) has an -OH and a C=O group, but the O-H peak of a phenol is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid, and the aldehyde and phenol combination does not fit the overall pattern as well as a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** The signal at such a high chemical shift (downfield) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Its integration as one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s) are consistent with this assignment.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The two signals in the aromatic region provide crucial information about the substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   There are two distinct signals, not four, which indicates a degree of symmetry in the molecule.\n    *   Both signals are doublets (d), and each integrates to two protons (2H).\n    *   This specific pattern—two doublets, each representing two protons—is the classic signature of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para*-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry equivalent to the two on the other side.\n*   **Evaluating Remaining Options:**\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a *para* substitution pattern. It possesses a plane of symmetry that results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are shifted downfield (8.02 ppm), while the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are at a slightly higher field (7.72 ppm). This perfectly matches the observed spectrum.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *ortho*-substituted. It has no such symmetry, and all four aromatic protons are in chemically different environments. This would lead to four separate signals, not two.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule is also unsymmetrically substituted and would show three distinct signals for its three aromatic protons.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining all the spectral evidence, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the only structure that fits all the data. The MS shows a chlorinated compound with a mass of 156. The IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm confirm a carboxylic acid. The aromatic signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum definitively point to a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of about 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+/(M+2) ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic pattern for a molecule containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   All the proposed structures have a chemical formula of C₇H₅ClO₂. The calculated molecular weight for this formula is approximately 156.57 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This very broad absorption is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. The position, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   The IR data points towards a carboxylic acid. Options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid) are carboxylic acids. Option B (Phenyl chloroformate) is an acyl chloride ester, which would lack the broad O-H peak. Option C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) has a hydroxyl and an aldehyde group, but the O-H peak of a phenol is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid, and it lacks the specific carboxylic acid proton signal in the NMR.\n\n### 3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Its integration as 1H confirms one such proton. This further supports the carboxylic acid assignment and rules out options B and C.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   The spectrum shows two signals in the aromatic region, both of which are doublets, and each integrates to 2H.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is indicative of a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring results in only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons.\n    *   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (Option A)** is *ortho*-substituted. This would result in four unique aromatic proton signals, creating a more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (Option D)** is *para*-substituted. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm). The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the chlorine atom are less deshielded and appear slightly upfield (7.72 ppm). This predicted pattern perfectly matches the experimental data. Published NMR data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirms these chemical shifts.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic methods:\n*   **MS** confirms a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   **IR** confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid proton and shows a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nAll data are consistent only with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n### Analysis of Spectral Data to Identify Unnamed Compound\n\nBased on the provided spectral information, a step-by-step analysis leads to the identification of the unknown white solid.\n\n#### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)\nThe mass spectrum provides crucial information about the molecular weight and elemental composition of the compound.\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** A peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound, containing the most abundant isotopes, is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** A peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32% suggests the presence of a chlorine atom. Chlorine has two common isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with natural abundances of approximately 75% and 25%, respectively. This leads to an M+ to M+2 peak ratio of about 3:1, which matches the observed 100% to 32% ratio.\n\nCalculating the molecular weights of the options with ³⁵Cl:\n*   **Phenyl chloroformate (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂):** 156.56 g/mol.\n*   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂):** 156.57 g/mol.\n*   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂):** 156.57 g/mol.\n*   **3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂):** 156.57 g/mol.\n\nAll four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n#### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy\nThe IR spectrum reveals the functional groups present in the molecule.\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded, typically as a dimer.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n\nThis information strongly points to the presence of an aromatic carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This allows us to eliminate phenyl chloroformate (A), which lacks the -OH group, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D), which has an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group, but not a carboxylic acid. Both 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B) and 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C) are consistent with this data.\n\n#### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides detailed information about the structure and chemical environment of the hydrogen atoms.\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal, far downfield, is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its integration as a single proton confirms this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm) indicate four protons on a benzene ring. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. This symmetry results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm).\n\n#### Conclusion\nEvaluating the remaining options based on the ¹H NMR data:\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a *para*-substitution pattern, which would produce the observed two doublets for two protons each in the aromatic region. This structure is consistent with all three pieces of spectral data.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has an *ortho*-substitution pattern. This would result in a more complex splitting pattern with four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\nTherefore, the only structure that fits all the provided spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotope of each element.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The intensity ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formulas and weights of the options for the ³⁵Cl isotope:\n        *   All options (A, B, C, D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   Molecular Weight = (7 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + (1 × 35.45) + (2 × 16.00) ≈ 156.5 g/mol. Using integer masses for C (12), H (1), O (16), and ³⁵Cl (35), the MW is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the M+ peak. The M+2 peak at 158 would correspond to the molecule containing the ³⁷Cl isotope.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   There is a very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This is a textbook signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules causes this significant broadening.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carbonyl in a conjugated system, such as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is characteristic of the highly deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid. The integration of 1H confirms it's a single proton, and it appears as a singlet because it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substitution makes the two protons ortho to one substituent chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. The downfield position of these signals indicates that the benzene ring is attached to electron-withdrawing groups (like -Cl and -COOH). The most deshielded protons (8.02 ppm) are likely the two protons ortho to the strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The protons at 7.72 ppm would be the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Contains an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. The NMR would show 3 distinct aromatic protons, not the 2H/2H doublet pattern.\n    *   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride. It lacks the acidic O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) isomer. It has a carboxylic acid group, but its four aromatic protons would be non-equivalent, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule fits all the data perfectly.\n        *   It has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope).\n        *   It contains one chlorine atom.\n        *   It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR data.\n        *   It is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene, which explains the characteristic ¹H NMR pattern of two doublets, each for 2H.\n        *   It has the acidic proton, matching the signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:** The spectral data points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molar mass of the molecule with the most common isotopes. Since this is the base peak (100% relative abundance), we can assume the molar mass is 156 g/mol.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an abundance of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which simplifies to approximately 3:1.\n    *   This 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 is a classic isotopic signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom, because the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl. The molecule with ³⁵Cl has a mass of 156, and the molecule with ³⁷Cl has a mass of 158.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this extreme broadening.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with other protons and integrates to one proton ('1H').\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n        *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n        *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent to each other. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets. The downfield chemical shifts (7.72 and 8.02 ppm) indicate that both substituents on the ring are electron-withdrawing.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Has no carboxylic acid. Inconsistent with IR and NMR.\n    *   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would show an aldehyde proton (~10 ppm) but not a carboxylic acid proton (~11-12 ppm). The aromatic substitution pattern would also be different (3 protons, not 4, and a different splitting pattern). Inconsistent with IR and NMR.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a carboxylic acid, consistent with the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal. However, it is *ortho*-substituted. This would lead to four distinct aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR, not the simple two doublets observed.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n        *   **MS:** Has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂, Molar mass = 156.57 g/mol. Contains one chlorine atom. This matches the MS data.\n        *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid. This matches the IR data.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** It is a carboxylic acid, which explains the 11.0 ppm signal. It is *para*-substituted with two electron-withdrawing groups (-COOH and -Cl), which perfectly explains the NMR pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H. The protons ortho to the stronger electron-withdrawing group (-COOH) would be further downfield (8.02 ppm), and the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be slightly more shielded (7.72 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion:** All provided spectral data are fully consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis is a structural elucidation problem. I will analyze each piece of spectroscopic data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at **m/z = 156** represents the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a peak at **m/z = 158**, which is two mass units heavier. Its intensity is **32%** relative to the M⁺ peak (100%). This M⁺ to M⁺+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a definitive signature for the presence of a **single chlorine (Cl) atom** in the molecule. This is because chlorine's natural isotopes are ³⁵Cl (~75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~25% abundance), which have a mass difference of 2 amu and an abundance ratio of roughly 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules is responsible for this significant broadening.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This intense absorption falls in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is consistent with a carbonyl group that is part of a conjugated system, specifically an **aromatic carboxylic acid**.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n\n*   **Signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is highly diagnostic for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. Its integration confirms it represents a single proton (1H), and it appears as a singlet (s) because it typically does not couple with other protons. This provides strong confirmation for the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **Signals at 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):**\n    *   These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H, which indicates a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted)** benzene ring. Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent, and the two protons on the other side are also equivalent. These two sets of equivalent protons are adjacent and thus split each other's signal into a doublet.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**Synthesizing the Information and Evaluating the Options:**\n\nBased on the combined analysis, the unknown compound is a benzoic acid with a single chlorine atom attached at the *para* (4) position.\n\nLet's check the options:\n*   A) Phenyl chloroformate: Incorrect. This is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid.\n*   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, and the substitution pattern is wrong.\n*   C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Incorrect. While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would produce a more complex NMR splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **Correct**. This structure perfectly fits all the data: it has a molecular weight of 156.5 g/mol, contains one chlorine atom (MS), is a carboxylic acid (IR and NMR), and has a para-substitution pattern (NMR).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak). The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is characteristic of a compound containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes being roughly 3:1).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the options. All options (A, B, C, D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The nominal mass for this formula (using ¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl, ¹⁶O) is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + 35 + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the M+ peak. The M+2 peak at 158 corresponds to the molecule containing the ³⁷Cl isotope. So, the mass spectrometry data is consistent with all four options.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for a carbonyl group conjugated with an aromatic ring, as found in a benzoic acid derivative.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This evidence favors options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and C (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and rules out option B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acyl chloride) and option D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenol and an aldehyde group).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm region is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The signal is a singlet ('s') because this proton typically does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H'). This further confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid, narrowing the choices down to A and C.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum shows two signals in the aromatic region:\n        *   8.02 ppm (d, 2H)\n        *   7.72 ppm (d, 2H)\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The protons on each side of the ring are identical, and each has only one adjacent proton to couple with, resulting in a doublet.\n    *   Let's compare this with our remaining options:\n        *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) benzene ring. It has four unique aromatic protons, which would give a much more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n        *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. It has two sets of equivalent protons: the two protons ortho to the carboxylic acid group and the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom. This substitution pattern perfectly explains the observed 'two doublets of 2H each' splitting pattern. The more electron-withdrawing carboxyl group deshields the adjacent protons more, causing them to appear further downfield (at 8.02 ppm), while the protons adjacent to the chlorine atom appear slightly upfield (at 7.72 ppm).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The mass spectrum confirms the molecular formula and the presence of chlorine. The IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm confirm the carboxylic acid functional group. The splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the 1,4-(para) substitution on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unidentified compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at **m/z = 156** represents the molecular weight of the compound.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** A significant peak is observed at **m/z = 158** with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Isotopic Analysis:** The presence of a molecular ion peak (M+) and an M+2 peak with a height ratio of approximately 3:1 (100% to 32%) is a distinct isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom. The molecular weight of the options (all C7H5ClO2) with the ³⁵Cl isotope is approximately 156 g/mol.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. This strong evidence suggests the presence of a -COOH functional group.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When considered with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid. Conjugation to an aromatic ring can lower the frequency to this range.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The IR data strongly indicate the compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option A (an aldehyde/phenol) and option C (an acid chloride).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-12 ppm range is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The integration for one proton (1H) and its singlet nature (no adjacent protons to couple with) is fully consistent with this assignment.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   There are two signals in the aromatic region, one at 8.02 ppm and another at 7.72 ppm.\n    *   Both signals are doublets, meaning the protons they represent are each adjacent to only one other proton.\n    *   Each signal integrates to 2H, meaning there are two equivalent protons of each type.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic sign of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Remaining Options\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. It would show four distinct and more complex signals in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is a *para*-substituted benzene ring, which has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons adjacent to the carboxylic acid group equivalent and the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom equivalent. This leads to the exact ¹H NMR pattern observed: two doublets, each representing 2H. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group deshields the adjacent protons more, causing them to appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) compared to the protons adjacent to the chlorine (7.72 ppm).\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the combined evidence from Mass Spectrometry (chlorine present), IR spectroscopy (carboxylic acid), and ¹H NMR (carboxylic acid proton and a para-substituted aromatic ring), the only structure that fits all the data is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1.

This M+2 peak, having roughly one-third the intensity of the M+ peak, is a distinct isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156.5 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. A search confirms that the molecular formula for chlorobenzoic acid is C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This eliminates options B (an aldehyde) and D (a chloroformate ester).\n\n### 3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The chemical shift for this proton is often found above 10 ppm. Its integration as 1H confirms one such proton. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, points to a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. This symmetry means there are two distinct sets of aromatic protons.\n\n### 4. Structural Determination\n*   Based on the combined data, the unknown compound is a **chlorobenzoic acid**.\n*   The IR and NMR data confirm the carboxylic acid group.\n*   The MS data confirms the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   The ¹H NMR splitting pattern (two doublets) specifically indicates a **para** (1,4) substitution on the benzene ring.\n*   Comparing this with the options:\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure is a *para*-substituted chlorobenzoic acid, which perfectly matches all the spectral evidence. Published spectral data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid show very similar ¹H NMR shifts.\n    *   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Does not contain a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is *ortho*-substituted. The four aromatic protons would not be equivalent in pairs and would produce a more complex splitting pattern than two doublets.\n    *   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Is an ester and lacks the carboxylic acid group, which means it would not show the broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports the identification of the compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-p-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** The spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** A peak at **m/z = 158** is observed with an intensity that is 32% of the M⁺ peak. This M⁺/ (M+2) ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic pattern for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** All the proposed structures (Phenyl chloroformate, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, and 4-chlorobenzoic acid) share the same molecular formula: C₇H₅ClO₂. The calculated molecular weight for this formula, using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl, ¹⁶O), is 156.57 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\nThe mass spectrum confirms that the molecule has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and contains one chlorine atom, but it does not distinguish between the four isomers.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid** that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is indicative of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\nThis IR data strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate phenyl chloroformate (A), which is an acid chloride/ester and would lack the broad O-H peak, and 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (B), which is an aldehyde with a phenolic -OH. The IR of a phenolic -OH is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid. This narrows the possibilities down to the two carboxylic acid isomers: 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C) and 4-chlorobenzoic acid (D).\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal appearing this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) which is a singlet and integrates to one proton is definitive evidence of a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COOH). This further confirms that the unknown is either 2- or 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet signal integrating to two protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** Another doublet signal integrating to two protons.\n\nThis pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each accounting for two protons, indicates a high degree of symmetry in the benzene ring. Specifically, it points to a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, the protons at positions 2 and 6 are chemically equivalent, as are the protons at positions 3 and 5. This symmetry results in two signals, each representing two protons.\n\n*   **Evaluating the remaining options:**\n    *   **(C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. All four aromatic protons would be in unique chemical environments, leading to a more complex spectrum with four separate signals (or complex multiplets), each integrating to one proton. The ¹H NMR spectrum for 2-chlorobenzoic acid shows four distinct signals in the aromatic region.\n    *   **(D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *para*-substituted. Due to the plane of symmetry through carbons 1 and 4, the protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 are equivalent. This would produce exactly the pattern observed: two doublets, each integrating to 2H. Published spectra for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirm this pattern.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques, the unknown compound is identified as **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n*   **MS** established the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   **IR** identified the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n*   **¹H NMR** determined the substitution pattern on the aromatic ring to be para (1,4).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
