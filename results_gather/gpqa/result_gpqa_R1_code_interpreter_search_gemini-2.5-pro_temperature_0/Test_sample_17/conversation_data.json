    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Notation:**\n    The notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of two elements, X and Y, in a star relative to the Sun. It is defined as:\n    `[X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log10( (n_X / n_Y)_sun )`\n    where `n_X` and `n_Y` are the number densities (or number of atoms) of elements X and Y, respectively. The logarithm is base 10.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Information for Star_1:**\n    We are given:\n    *   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`\n    *   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`\n\n    From `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`:\n    `log10( (n_Fe / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Fe / n_H)_sun ) = 0`\n    `log10( (n_Fe / n_H)_1 ) = log10( (n_Fe / n_H)_sun )`\n\n    From `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`:\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_Fe)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_Fe)_sun ) = 0.3`\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_Fe)_1 ) = 0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_Fe)_sun )`\n\n    We want to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `(n_Si / n_H)_1`. We can use the property of logarithms: `log(a*b) = log(a) + log(b)`.\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) = log10( (n_Si / n_Fe)_1 * (n_Fe / n_H)_1 )`\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) = log10( (n_Si / n_Fe)_1 ) + log10( (n_Fe / n_H)_1 )`\n    Substitute the expressions from above:\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) = (0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_Fe)_sun )) + (log10( (n_Fe / n_H)_sun ))`\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) = 0.3 + (log10( (n_Si / n_Fe)_sun ) + log10( (n_Fe / n_H)_sun ))`\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) = 0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n\n3.  **Analyze the Information for Star_2:**\n    We are given:\n    *   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`\n    *   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`\n\n    From `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`:\n    `log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_2 ) - log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_sun ) = 0`\n    `log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_2 ) = log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_sun )`\n\n    From `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`:\n    `log10( (n_Mg / n_Si)_2 ) - log10( (n_Mg / n_Si)_sun ) = 0.3`\n    `log10( (n_Mg / n_Si)_2 ) = 0.3 + log10( (n_Mg / n_Si)_sun )`\n\n    We want to find `(n_Si / n_H)_2`. We can express this using the given magnesium abundances. Using the property `log(a/b) = log(a) - log(b)`:\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_2 / (n_Mg / n_Si)_2 )`\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_2 ) - log10( (n_Mg / n_Si)_2 )`\n    Substitute the expressions from above:\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = (log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_sun )) - (0.3 + log10( (n_Mg / n_Si)_sun ))`\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_sun ) - log10( (n_Mg / n_Si)_sun ) - 0.3`\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_sun / (n_Mg / n_Si)_sun ) - 0.3`\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) - 0.3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    The question asks for the \"ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres\". In this context, this refers to the ratio of their abundance fractions, which we have calculated relative to hydrogen. Let the required ratio be `R`.\n    `R = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`\n\n    To find `R`, we can take the logarithm:\n    `log10(R) = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 )`\n    Substitute the results from steps 2 and 3:\n    `log10(R) = (0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )) - (log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) - 0.3)`\n    `log10(R) = 0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) + 0.3`\n    `log10(R) = 0.6`\n\n    Now, solve for `R`:\n    `R = 10^0.6`\n\n5.  **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    We need to calculate the value of `10^0.6`. This can be done with a calculator.\n    ```python\n    import math\n    \n    ratio = 10**0.6\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    The result is approximately 3.98.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The ratio of silicon atoms (abundance fractions) in Star_1 to Star_2 is `R = 10^0.6 â‰ˆ 3.98`. This value is closest to option A. The information about the stellar masses and the absolute solar abundances of Fe and Mg are not required for this calculation as they cancel out.\n\n<<<A>>>"
