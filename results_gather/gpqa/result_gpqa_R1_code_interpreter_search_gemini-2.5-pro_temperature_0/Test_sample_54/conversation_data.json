    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the number of signals and their integrations.**\n    *   There are four distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   The integrations are 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H, for a total of 8 protons.\n    *   Let's check the proton count for the possible structures:\n        *   Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2): 3 (CH3) + 1 (CH) + 1 (CH) + 3 (CH3) = 8 protons. This matches.\n        *   Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2): 3 (CH3) + 2 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 1 (CH) + 3 (CH3) = 10 protons. This does not match the integration data.\n    *   Based on the total number of protons, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (C and D). The compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the signal at 2.1 ppm.**\n    *   **Signal:** 2.1 ppm (3H, s)\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This is a typical chemical shift for protons of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group in an acetate ester (-O-C(=O)-CH3).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Confirms it's a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet means these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. This is consistent with the acetate methyl group, which is isolated.\n    *   This signal is present in both cis- and trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the signals in the alkene (vinyl) region and the allylic region.**\n    *   We have two signals in the vinyl region: 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm. These correspond to the two protons on the C=C double bond.\n    *   We have one signal in the allylic region: 1.6 ppm. This corresponds to the methyl group attached to the double bond.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the signal at 1.6 ppm.**\n    *   **Signal:** 1.6 ppm (3H, d)\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Confirms it's a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This is consistent with the CH3-CH= structure in propenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 5: Analyze the vinyl proton signals and their coupling constant.**\n    *   **Signal 1:** 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)\n    *   **Signal 2:** 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)\n    *   These two signals represent the two protons on the double bond (H-C=C-H). They are coupled to each other.\n    *   The key piece of information is the **coupling constant (J)**. The signal at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant of J = 16.0 Hz.\n    *   For protons on a double bond:\n        *   A **trans** relationship (protons on opposite sides) typically shows a large coupling constant, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   A **cis** relationship (protons on the same side) typically shows a smaller coupling constant, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   The observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** is a clear indication of a **trans** configuration.\n\n*   **Step 6: Confirm the structure and assignments.**\n    *   Let's assign the protons in **Trans-propenyl acetate**:\n        ```\n            H(b)    O\n             \\     //\n              C = C\n             /     \\\n        H3C(a)      H(c) - O - C - CH3(d)\n        ```\n    *   **Protons (d) at 2.1 ppm:** The acetate methyl group (-O-C(=O)-CH3). It's a singlet with 3H. This matches.\n    *   **Protons (a) at 1.6 ppm:** The methyl group on the double bond (CH3-CH=). It's coupled to one proton, H(b), so it appears as a doublet with 3H. This matches.\n    *   **Proton (c) at 7.0 ppm:** This vinyl proton is attached to the carbon bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom, so it is the most deshielded (highest ppm). It is coupled only to H(b), so it appears as a doublet. The coupling constant J(bc) is 16.0 Hz. This matches.\n    *   **Proton (b) at 5.5 ppm:** This vinyl proton is coupled to H(c) (one proton, giving a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (a) (three protons, giving a quartet). The resulting multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq). This matches.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** All the data (chemical shifts, integrations, multiplicities, and especially the coupling constant) are perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
