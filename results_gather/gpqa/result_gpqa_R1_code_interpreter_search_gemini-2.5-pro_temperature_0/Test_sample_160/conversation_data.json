    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target for a collision.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Two Scenarios**\n\nThe problem describes two different mean free paths, λ1 and λ2, measured under the same conditions of gas composition, pressure, and temperature. This means the number density of the gas molecules, `n`, is the same in both scenarios.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Mean Free Path λ1**\n    *   This is the mean free path of the **gas molecules colliding with each other**.\n    *   The moving particles are gas molecules.\n    *   The target particles are also gas molecules.\n    *   Because both the moving and target particles are in thermal motion, a correction factor of `sqrt(2)` is introduced to account for their relative velocities.\n    *   The collision cross-section, let's call it `σ_gas-gas`, is determined by the physical size of the gas molecules (their kinetic diameter).\n    *   The formula for λ1 is: **λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gas-gas)**\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Mean Free Path λ2**\n    *   This is the mean free path of the **beam electrons scattering off the gas molecules**.\n    *   The moving particles are high-energy electrons (1000 keV).\n    *   The target particles are the gas molecules.\n    *   The electrons are moving at relativistic speeds (over 90% of the speed of light), while the gas molecules have much lower thermal velocities. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets. The `sqrt(2)` factor does not apply here.\n    *   The collision cross-section, let's call it `σ_e-gas`, is for the scattering of a high-energy electron by a gas molecule.\n    *   The formula for λ2 is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)**\n\n### **3. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nThe key to comparing λ1 and λ2 is to compare their respective collision cross-sections, `σ_gas-gas` and `σ_e-gas`.\n\n*   **σ_gas-gas**: This is the kinetic cross-section. It's related to the physical size of the molecules. For typical small gas molecules like N2, this is on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m². The interaction is short-range (van der Waals forces), so the molecules must get physically close to \"collide\".\n\n*   **σ_e-gas**: This is the scattering cross-section for a very high-energy (1000 keV) electron. Although the electron interacts with the atom's electromagnetic field (a long-range force), its extremely high velocity means it spends very little time near any given atom. A significant scattering event (collision) that deflects the electron from the beam only occurs if the electron passes very close to the atomic nucleus. As a result, the effective target area for a high-energy electron is much smaller than the physical size of the atom.\n*   Physics principles and experimental data (e.g., from electron microscopy literature) confirm that for high-energy electrons, the scattering cross-section is much smaller than the gas-kinetic cross-section.\n    **σ_e-gas << σ_gas-gas**\n\n### **4. Compare λ1 and λ2**\n\nNow we can find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_e-gas)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gas-gas)]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gas-gas) / (n * σ_e-gas)\n\nλ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas)\n\nWe have established two key points:\n1.  `sqrt(2)` is approximately 1.414.\n2.  The ratio `(σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas)` is a very large number (much greater than 1), typically on the order of 10³ to 10⁵.\n\nTherefore, the ratio `λ2 / λ1` is the product of `sqrt(2)` and another large number, meaning `λ2` is vastly larger than `λ1`.\n\nλ2 >> sqrt(2) * λ1\nλ2 >> 1.414 * λ1\n\n### **5. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's check the given options against our conclusion that `λ2` is much larger than `1.414 * λ1`.\n\n*   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is incorrect. Our derivation shows that λ2 is much larger than 1.414*λ1, so it cannot be less than 1.22*λ1.\n*   B) λ2 < λ1: This is incorrect. λ2 is much larger than λ1.\n*   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This is correct. Since we know λ2 is much larger than 1.414*λ1, it is certainly greater than or equal to 1.22*λ1. The number 1.22 is likely a distractor (possibly referencing the Rayleigh criterion in optics, 1.22λ/D), but the inequality holds true based on the physics of the situation.\n*   D) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is incorrect. There is a clear physical reason for λ1 and λ2 to be different.\n\nThe only conclusion that is consistent with the physical principles is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
