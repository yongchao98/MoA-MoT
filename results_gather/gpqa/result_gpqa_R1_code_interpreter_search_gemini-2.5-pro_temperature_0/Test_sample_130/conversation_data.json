    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl).\n    *   The high symmetry (single ¹H peak, two ¹³C peaks) and the chemical shifts are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has two equivalent alkene protons (¹H singlet ~7.0-7.3 ppm) and two sets of equivalent carbons (alkene carbons ~137 ppm and carbonyl carbons ~165 ppm). This perfectly matches the description.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C=C-C=C).\n    *   The four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) each have a methyl group.\n    *   The fifth carbon (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   The product's molecular formula should be the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given for the products, confirming our reactant identification.\n\n**3. Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction with a cyclic diene like cyclopentadiene can produce two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** adduct and the ***exo*** adduct.\n*   The **endo rule** predicts that the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction under kinetic control is the *endo* adduct. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the dienophile's activating groups (the anhydride part) and the developing double bond in the transition state. The *exo* adduct is typically the minor product.\n*   Let's visualize the structures: The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the newly formed double bond (C(Me)=C(Me)) and on the opposite side of the CH₂ bridge. This means the anhydride protons are *syn* (on the same face) to the alkene's methyl groups.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the CH₂ bridge and on the opposite side of the double bond. This means the anhydride protons are *anti* (on opposite faces) to the alkene's methyl groups.\n\n**4. Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates spatial proximity.\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**.\n*   This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n*   Let's analyze the key proximities:\n    *   **Interaction 1: Anhydride Protons vs. Alkene Methyl Groups.**\n        *   In the **endo** (major) product, the anhydride protons are *syn* to the alkene methyl groups. They are close in space. A **strong NOE** is expected.\n        *   In the **exo** (minor) product, the anhydride protons are *anti* to the alkene methyl groups. They are far apart. **No NOE** is expected.\n    *   **Interaction 2: Anhydride Protons vs. CH₂ Bridge Protons.**\n        *   In the **endo** (major) product, the anhydride protons are *anti* to the CH₂ bridge. They are far apart. **No NOE** is expected.\n        *   In the **exo** (minor) product, the anhydride protons are *syn* to the CH₂ bridge. They are close in space. A **strong NOE** is expected.\n\n*   Since the distinguishing cross-peak is present in the major product (endo), it must be due to the interaction between the **anhydride protons** and the **alkene methyl groups**.\n\n**5. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\n*   Now we need to match these proton groups to the signals described in the options.\n*   **Anhydride Protons:** There are two of them. Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent to bridgehead carbons with no protons, so they will appear as a **singlet**. Their chemical shift, being on a strained ring and alpha to two carbonyl groups, will be relatively high, around 3-4 ppm. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Alkene Methyl Groups:** There are two methyl groups on the double bond. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. This will give a **singlet** with an integral of **6H**. The chemical shift for methyl groups on a double bond is typically around 1.5-2.0 ppm. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups on sp³ carbons. This would be a 6H singlet at a lower shift, ~1.0 ppm.\n*   **CH₂ Bridge Protons:** Two diastereotopic protons, likely giving a complex signal (or two doublets) integrating to 2H in the aliphatic region.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\n*   The NOESY cross-peak unique to the major (*endo*) product connects the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl groups.\n*   These correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   This matches option D.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   A) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, one bridge H). This interaction would be present in both isomers.\n*   B) 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, one bridge H) and 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm, anhydride H). This interaction is strong in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product.\n*   C) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm, alkene Me). This interaction would be present in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly identifies the unique NOE cross-peak in the major product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
