    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   The mean decay distance ($d$) is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) in the lab frame and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$).\n        $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n    *   The mean lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame ($\\tau_0$) is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n        $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   Due to special relativity, a moving particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab frame. This is called time dilation. The lab frame lifetime is given by:\n        $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \\frac{E}{mc^2}$, where $E$ is the total energy, $m$ is the rest mass, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   The velocity is often expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = v/c$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation Strategy:**\n    *   Combine the equations from step 2 to get a single formula for the mean decay distance.\n        $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    *   This can be simplified. The momentum $p$ is related to energy and mass by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The velocity is $\\beta = pc/E$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{E}{mc^2} \\cdot \\frac{pc}{E} = \\frac{pc}{mc^2}$.\n    *   Substituting this into the equation for $d$:\n        $d = \\left(\\frac{pc}{mc^2}\\right) c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n    *   We can calculate the momentum $pc$ from the given energy and mass:\n        $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$\n    *   So the final formula is:\n        $d = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n4.  **Identify and List the Given Values and Constants:**\n    *   Total energy, $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Rest mass, $m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$ (This corresponds to rest mass energy $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$)\n    *   Decay width, $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   A useful physical constant is the product of the reduced Planck constant and the speed of light, $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV fm} = 197.327 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ MeV m}$.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the momentum term, $pc$:\n        $pc = \\sqrt{(8000 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (1200 \\text{ MeV})^2}$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} \\text{ MeV}$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV} \\approx 7909.49 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Now, substitute all values into the formula for $d$:\n        $d = \\frac{7909.49 \\text{ MeV}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}} \\times \\frac{197.327 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ MeV m}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n    *   The units of MeV cancel out, leaving the distance in meters.\n        $d = \\left(\\frac{7909.49}{1200}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{197.327}{320}\\right) \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n        $d \\approx 6.5912 \\times 0.6166 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n        $d \\approx 4.0646 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value is $4.0646 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n    The given options are:\n    A) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n    B) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n    C) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n    D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\n    The calculated value is extremely close to option A. The minor difference is likely due to the precision of the constants used.\n\nTo ensure high precision, the calculation is performed using a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nE_X = 8000  # MeV\nm_X = 1200  # MeV\nGamma_X = 320  # MeV\n\n# Constants\n# hbar*c in MeV*m\nhbar_c = 1.973269804e-13  # MeV*m\n\n# Calculate the momentum in MeV/c\n# E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 => pc = sqrt(E^2 - (mc^2)^2)\npc = math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay distance d = (pc / mc^2) * (hbar*c / Gamma)\n# Note: m_X is the mass in MeV/c^2, so mc^2 is just m_X in MeV.\nmean_decay_distance = (pc / m_X) * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\n\nprint(f\"{mean_decay_distance:.4e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n4.0646e-15\n</execute_result>\nThe code output confirms the result is $4.0646 \\times 10^{-15}$ m. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
