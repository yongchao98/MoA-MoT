    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The problem describes a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions. A key property of identical fermions is that they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n2.  **Recall the Pauli Exclusion Principle:** This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this potential well is defined by its principal quantum number `n` and its spin projection `m_s` (spin up or spin down). This means that for each energy level `n`, there are two available states: one for a spin-up particle and one for a spin-down particle. Therefore, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\n3.  **Identify the Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by the formula:\n    E_n = n^2 * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n    where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\n4.  **Use the Given Energy Unit:** The problem conveniently defines a base energy unit E = π²ħ² / 2mL². So, we can express the single-particle energy levels simply as:\n    *   E₁ = 1² * E = E\n    *   E₂ = 2² * E = 4E\n    *   E₃ = 3² * E = 9E\n    *   E₄ = 4² * E = 16E\n    *   and so on.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy:** The ground state is the lowest possible total energy of the system. To achieve this, we must fill the available energy levels from the bottom up with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   The lowest energy level is n=1. We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is 2 * E₁ = 2E.\n    *   We have two more particles to place. The next lowest energy level is n=2. We can place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is 2 * E₂ = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n        E_ground = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n6.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy:** The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n    *   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n        E_1st_excited = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy:** The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n    *   The ground state energy is 10E.\n    *   The first excited state energy is 15E (an increase of 5E).\n    *   Let's consider other possible single-particle promotions from the ground state:\n        *   **Possibility A:** Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration becomes: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n            *   Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = E + 2(4E) + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E. (This is an increase of 8E from the ground state).\n        *   **Possibility B:** Promote a particle from n=2 to n=4 (leaving the other three as they were in the ground state). The configuration becomes: two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n            *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. (An increase of 12E).\n        *   **Possibility C (a two-particle excitation):** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration becomes: two in n=1, two in n=3.\n            *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = 2E + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E. (An increase of 10E).\n\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states we found: 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E.\n    *   The lowest is 15E (the first excited state).\n    *   The next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n8.  **Final Result:**\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
