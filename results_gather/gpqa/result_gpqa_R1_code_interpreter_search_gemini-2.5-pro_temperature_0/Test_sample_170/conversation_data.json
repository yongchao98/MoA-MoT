    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring (C6H5-X). The substituent (X) on the ring determines two things:\n1.  **Reactivity:** Whether the ring reacts faster (activating group) or slower (deactivating group) than benzene itself.\n2.  **Orientation:** Where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will add. Substituents are either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*.\n\nThe question asks to arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the *para-isomer*.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nLet's classify the substituent for each substance:\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho, para-directing**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is **deactivating** but **ortho, para-directing** (a special case).\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a nitro group. It is strongly **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho, para-directing**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances 2, 4, and 6 are meta-directors. For these compounds, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct, so its yield will be very low. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to how strongly the group deactivates the ring and directs to the meta position.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength for these groups is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   This means -NO2 is the strongest meta-director, followed by -COOH, and then -COOC2H5.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be the lowest for nitrobenzene (4), then higher for benzoic acid (6), and slightly higher again for ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   So, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\nBased on typical experimental data:\n*   Bromination of Nitrobenzene (4) gives <1% para-isomer.\n*   Bromination of Benzoic acid (6) gives ~2% para-isomer.\n*   Bromination of Ethyl benzoate (2) gives a slightly higher percentage than benzoic acid, around 3-5%.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances 1, 3, and 5 are ortho, para-directors. For these compounds, the ortho and para isomers are the major products. The ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio) is primarily determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1):** The methyl group is relatively small. It gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products. The para-isomer yield is about 67%.\n*   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance strongly favors the para position. The para-isomer yield is very high, about 94%.\n*   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** The chloro group's size is comparable to a methyl group, but its electronic properties also influence the p/o ratio. Experimentally, it is highly para-directing. The para-isomer yield is about 89%.\n\nComparing the para-yields for this group:\n*   Toluene (1): ~67%\n*   Chlorobenzene (3): ~89%\n*   Ethylbenzene (5): ~94%\n\nThe order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Orders**\n\nThe meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have significantly lower para-yields than the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 3, 5).\n\nCombining the two ordered sets:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 3 < 5)\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Given Options**\n\nLet's examine the options provided:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nOur derived order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5. None of the options match this exactly. However, option C is the closest.\n\nLet's analyze Option C: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n*   The order of the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) is correct.\n*   The placement of the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors is correct.\n*   The placement of toluene (1) as the o,p-director with the lowest para-yield is correct.\n*   The only discrepancy is the relative order of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). Option C suggests that chlorobenzene gives a higher para-yield than ethylbenzene (5 < 3), whereas our data shows the opposite (3 < 5).\n\nGiven that all other options contain more significant and fundamental errors (e.g., incorrect ordering of meta-directors), Option C is the most plausible answer. It is likely that there is a small error in the question's options, but it follows the correct chemical principles for most of the sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>"
