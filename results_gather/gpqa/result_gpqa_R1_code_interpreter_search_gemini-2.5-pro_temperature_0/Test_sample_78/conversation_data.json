    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the product's structure from the given NMR data.**\n\n    The problem provides the ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR spectra of the product formed from the reaction of Compound X. Let's deduce the structure of this product first.\n\n    **¹³C-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), most likely a ketone or an aldehyde.\n    *   **δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s):** These are signals in the aliphatic region, corresponding to two different methyl (CH₃) groups. The signal at ~21 ppm is typical for a methyl group on an aromatic ring (like in toluene), and the signal at ~28 ppm is consistent with a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl (an acetyl group).\n    *   **δ 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s):** These six signals (totaling 8 carbons) are in the alkene/aromatic region (δ 100-150 ppm). This suggests a substituted benzene ring and a C=C double bond. The presence of two signals integrating to 2 carbons each (126.9 and 129.1) strongly indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n\n    **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s):** These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. They correspond to the two methyl groups identified in the ¹³C-NMR.\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d):** These are two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This pattern is the classic signature of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d):** These are two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton. They are in the vinylic region and are coupled to each other, indicating a disubstituted C=C double bond (-CH=CH-). The large difference in chemical shifts suggests an α,β-unsaturated system.\n\n    **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    Based on the analysis, the product contains:\n    1.  An acetyl group (CH₃-C=O).\n    2.  A para-substituted benzene ring with a methyl group attached (a p-tolyl group).\n    3.  A -CH=CH- double bond connecting the acetyl group and the p-tolyl group.\n\n    The structure is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, also known as **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula of this product: C₁₁H₁₂O.\n    *   p-tolyl group (C₇H₇) + but-3-en-2-one fragment (C₄H₅O) = C₁₁H₁₂O.\n    This matches the molecular formula of the starting material, Compound X. Therefore, the reaction is an isomerization.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction and relate the product to the starting material.**\n\n    The reaction is the isomerization of Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) to 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. The reaction is performed using 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), which is a non-nucleophilic base, in a nonpolar solvent at high temperature. This suggests a base-catalyzed rearrangement.\n\n    Since the product contains a p-tolyl group (a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position), the starting material, Compound X, must also contain this structural feature. The atoms are rearranged, but not added or removed.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the given options for Compound X.**\n\n    We need to find which of the given options has the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O and contains a p-tolyl group.\n\n    *   **A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:**\n        *   The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is p-Me-C₆H₄-CH=CH-. This contains a p-tolyl moiety.\n        *   The structure is the 4-methylstyryl group attached to an oxirane (epoxide) ring.\n        *   Formula: C₁₁H₁₂O. (C₇H₇ from p-tolyl + C₂H₂ from vinyl + C₂H₃O from oxirane = C₁₁H₁₂O).\n        *   This option is a strong candidate.\n\n    *   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:**\n        *   The \"styryl\" group is Ph-CH=CH-. It has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n        *   This cannot be Compound X.\n\n    *   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:**\n        *   The \"styryl\" group has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n        *   The formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match.\n        *   This cannot be Compound X.\n\n    *   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:**\n        *   This compound has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n        *   This cannot be Compound X.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclusion.**\n\n    Only option A, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, has the correct molecular formula and the necessary p-tolyl group to form the observed product through isomerization. The reaction is a known base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The base (DABCO) abstracts an acidic proton, leading to a ring-opening rearrangement that ultimately yields the thermodynamically more stable conjugated ketone.\n\n<<<A>>>"
