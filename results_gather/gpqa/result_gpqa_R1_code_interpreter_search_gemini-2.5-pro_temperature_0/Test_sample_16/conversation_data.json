    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemical Equilibrium:**\n    The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The formation of this complex is represented by the following equilibrium reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$\n    The given formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for this reaction is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n2.  **Set up the Dissociation Reaction:**\n    We are starting with a 0.02 M solution of the complex, which will dissociate slightly to reach equilibrium. The dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Use an ICE Table:**\n    Let's set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Apply the Equilibrium Constant Expression:**\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Make a Simplifying Approximation:**\n    Since the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means that the amount of complex that dissociates, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n    Therefore, we can approximate:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n6.  **Solve for x:**\n    The simplified equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    Now, solve for x, which represents the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a python script for the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# From the simplified equilibrium expression: x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\n# x represents the concentration of Ca^2+ ions at equilibrium.\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of Ca^2+ ions is: {x:.2e} M\")\n```\n<execute_output>\nThe concentration of Ca^2+ ions is: 6.32e-07 M\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation shows that the concentration of calcium ions, x, is approximately $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. Let's compare this to the given choices:\n    A) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    B) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    C) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    D) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\n    The calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Reaction and Equilibrium Constant:**\n    The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by the reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$\n    The formation constant ($K_f$) for this reaction is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n2.  **Dissociation of the Complex:**\n    Since we start with the complex, we need to consider its dissociation to find the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **ICE Table Setup:**\n    We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Applying the Equilibrium Expression:**\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplification and Calculation:**\n    Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is extremely large, the equilibrium lies heavily on the side of the complex. This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can therefore make the approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we solve for x, which represents $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$\n\n    The calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Comparing our calculated value with the given options:\n    A) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    B) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    C) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    D) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\n    The result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
