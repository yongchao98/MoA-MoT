    "This question requires an understanding of the physical principles and assumptions behind the Mott-Gurney law for space-charge-limited current (SCLC). Let's break down the conditions required for this law to be valid.\n\n1.  **Origin of the Current:** The Mott-Gurney law describes a current that is limited not by the intrinsic conductivity of the material but by the charge injected from a contact. When a voltage is applied, carriers are injected into the semiconductor/insulator. These injected carriers form a \"space charge\" that creates its own electric field, opposing the applied field and thus limiting the current flow.\n\n2.  **Carrier Type:** The standard Mott-Gurney equation is derived assuming that only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is mobile and contributes to the current. Therefore, it applies to a **single-carrier device**. This immediately rules out option D, which refers to a two-carrier device.\n\n3.  **Contact Type:** For SCLC to occur, the contact must be able to supply an abundance of carriers to be injected. This type of contact is called an **Ohmic contact**, which ideally presents no energy barrier to carrier injection. A Schottky contact, by contrast, is a rectifying contact that forms an energy barrier and limits carrier injection, preventing the SCLC regime. Therefore, the model requires an Ohmic contact, or in more general terms, a contact with **no carrier injection barrier**. This rules out option A.\n\n4.  **Material Properties (Traps):** The simplest form of the Mott-Gurney law, as given in the question, assumes an ideal material with no defect states (traps) in the bandgap. If traps were present, some of the injected carriers would be immobilized in these trap states and would not contribute to the current, but they would still contribute to the space charge. This would alter the relationship between J and V. Therefore, the equation is valid for a **trap-free** material.\n\n5.  **Transport Mechanism:** The current in the SCLC model is assumed to be driven by the electric field (a **drift current**). The contribution from the diffusion of carriers (due to concentration gradients) is assumed to be negligible. This is a valid assumption for devices that are not too thin and when the applied voltage is sufficiently large (typically > kT/e). Therefore, the model assumes **negligible diffusion current** and dominant drift current. This rules out option B, which incorrectly states \"negligible drift current\".\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   Incorrect. A Schottky contact limits injection, whereas SCLC requires an injecting (Ohmic) contact.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n    *   Incorrect. The SCLC is a drift-dominated current. The assumption is that the *diffusion* current is negligible, not the drift current.\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   Correct. This statement accurately summarizes the key assumptions:\n        *   \"trap-free\": No charge trapping.\n        *   \"single-carrier device\": Only one type of carrier is mobile.\n        *   \"no carrier injection barrier\": This is the condition for an ideal Ohmic contact, allowing for unlimited carrier injection.\n        *   \"negligible diffusion current\": The current is dominated by drift.\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   Incorrect. The model is for single-carrier injection.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct set of conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
