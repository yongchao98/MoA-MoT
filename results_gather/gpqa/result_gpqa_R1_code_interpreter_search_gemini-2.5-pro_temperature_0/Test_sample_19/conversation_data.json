    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that constitute the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n**Analysis of the Impulse Approximation:**\n\nThe impulse approximation is a cornerstone for interpreting high-energy scattering experiments off nuclei. The core idea is that if the interaction with the probe (e.g., an electron, a neutrino) is very rapid and involves a large momentum transfer, the interaction can be treated as occurring with a single nucleon that acts as if it were momentarily \"free\" from the influence of the other nucleons and the nuclear potential.\n\nLet's break down the required conditions for this approximation to hold:\n\n1.  **The interaction must be localized on a single nucleon.** The probe must interact with just one nucleon at a time. If the probe's wavelength is short enough (i.e., its momentum is high enough), it can resolve individual nucleons within the nucleus. This is the \"single nucleon interaction\" part. If the interaction involved multiple nucleons simultaneously (known as meson-exchange currents or correlation effects), the picture of a single free nucleon would be invalid. **Therefore, statement 1 is essential.**\n\n2.  **The interaction time must be much shorter than the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus.** The nucleon is bound by the strong force and moves around inside the nuclear potential. The impulse approximation assumes the \"hit\" from the probe is so fast (an \"impulse\") that the nucleon doesn't have time to interact with its neighbors or the binding potential *during* the collision. It's like taking a snapshot; at that instant, the binding forces are negligible compared to the interaction force. This means the interaction proceeds as if the nucleon were free of binding forces at that moment. **Therefore, statement 4 is essential.**\n\n3.  **The particles involved (the incoming probe, the outgoing probe, and the ejected nucleon) must not re-interact with the rest of the nucleus.** After the primary interaction with the \"selected\" nucleon, the outgoing particles must be able to leave the nucleus without further scattering off the other \"spectator\" nucleons. These are called Final State Interactions (FSIs). If FSIs are significant, the observed final state will be distorted and will not reflect the initial simple interaction. The assumption that these FSIs are negligible is equivalent to assuming the rest of the nucleus is \"transparent\" to the particles involved in the reaction. **Therefore, statement 2 is essential.**\n\n4.  **The internal structure of the nucleon.** Statement 3 concerns the quark-level description of the nucleon. The impulse approximation itself is about the nucleon's behavior *as a nucleon* within the nucleus. It is separate from the question of how to model the nucleon itself. One can apply the impulse approximation and then use either a relativistic or non-relativistic model for the nucleon's internal structure (its form factors, etc.). The assumption that the quarks are non-relativistic is an additional, and often incorrect, approximation that is not a fundamental part of the impulse approximation itself. The impulse approximation is used in both non-relativistic and highly relativistic regimes. **Therefore, statement 3 is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are:\n- The interaction is with a single nucleon (Statement 1).\n- The rest of the nucleus is transparent to the particles involved (Statement 2).\n- The nucleon is treated as free from binding forces during the brief interaction (Statement 4).\n\nThis corresponds to the combination 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
