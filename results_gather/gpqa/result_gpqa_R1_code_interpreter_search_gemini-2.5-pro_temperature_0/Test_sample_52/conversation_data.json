    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This is a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents, giving a C6H4 core.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates an \"ester group\". An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and one C-O single bond. This adds -COO- to our molecular fragments, which consists of 1 Carbon and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:** The NMR spectrum gives the most detailed clues about the structure.\n    *   **Six signals total:** This tells us there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals suggests a high degree of symmetry. This is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substitution pattern**. In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents (X-C6H4-Y), the four protons form an AA'BB' system, which typically resolves into two signals (often two doublets). This accounts for the C6H4 part of the structure.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(b) is split by both H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is only split by the adjacent H(b), resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This perfectly matches the description and confirms the presence of a -CH=CH-CH3 group.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) we just identified. This methyl group is coupled to a vinyl proton, so its signal would be a doublet.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must come from the other part of the molecule. Since we have an ester group and no other place for a methyl group (as there are no -CH2- groups), it must be part of the ester. This could be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH3). In either case, this methyl group is not adjacent to any protons, so its signal would be a singlet.\n        *   This accounts for two distinct -CH3 signals.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out the presence of groups like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), etc.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure and Determine the Formula:**\n    Based on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n    *   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n    *   A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n    *   An ester group that incorporates a methyl group.\n\n    There are two plausible ways to connect these fragments:\n    *   **Possibility A: Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**\n        The propenyl group and the methyl ester group are attached to the benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions.\n        Structure: CH3-CH=CH–C6H4–COOCH3\n    *   **Possibility B: 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate**\n        The propenyl group and the acetate group are attached to the benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions.\n        Structure: CH3-CH=CH–C6H4–OOCCH3\n\n    Now, let's determine the molecular formula for these structures.\n    *   **For both structures:**\n        *   Benzene ring (C6H4): 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n        *   Propenyl group (C3H5): 3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens\n        *   Ester part (COO) + Methyl part (CH3): 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n    *   **Total Count:**\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated formula is C11H12O2. Let's compare this with the options provided:\n    A) C12H12O2\n    B) C11H14O2\n    C) C11H12O2\n    D) C12H14O2\n\n    Our derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\n    Let's quickly check why the other options are incorrect:\n    *   **C11H14O2:** Compared to C11H12O2, this formula has two extra hydrogens. This would imply the absence of the C=C double bond in the propenyl group (making it a propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3). A propyl group contains -CH2- signals, which are explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n    *   **C12H14O2:** This formula has an extra CH2 group compared to our derived C11H12O2. Again, this is ruled out by the absence of -CH2- signals.\n    *   **C12H12O2:** This formula has an extra carbon atom compared to C11H12O2. It is not possible to add another carbon atom to the proposed structure without either introducing a -CH2- group or violating the other NMR signal constraints.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that perfectly fits all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
