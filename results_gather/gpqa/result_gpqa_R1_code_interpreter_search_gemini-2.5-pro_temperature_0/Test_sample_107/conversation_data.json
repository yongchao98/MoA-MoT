    "This problem requires us to compare the magnitude of two energy values: the paramagnetic coupling energy, which we'll denote as $\\langle H \\rangle$, and a specific atomic transition energy, $\\Delta E$.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)\n\nThe problem provides the wavelength of a transition in the Hydrogen atom, $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$. This wavelength corresponds to the H-beta line in the Balmer series (the transition from the n=4 to the n=2 energy level).\n\nThe energy of a photon associated with this transition can be calculated using the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $\nwhere:\n*   $h$ is Planck's constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s}$)\n*   $c$ is the speed of light ($3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}$)\n*   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength ($0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$)\n\nIt is often more convenient to work in units of electron-volts (eV). A useful conversion formula is:\n$ \\Delta E (\\text{eV}) = \\frac{1240}{\\lambda (\\text{nm})} $\nFirst, we convert the wavelength to nanometers:\n$ \\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm} $\nNow, we calculate the energy:\n$ \\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV} $\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\langle H \\rangle$)\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term describes the interaction of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. This is also known as the Zeeman effect. The interaction Hamiltonian is given by:\n$ H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B} $\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic dipole moment and $\\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by $\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$. Substituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$ H = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} $\nThe problem states that the magnetic field is parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product simplifies to $\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$.\n$ H = \\left(\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}\\right) \\frac{L_z}{\\hbar} B $\nThe energy shift, $\\langle H \\rangle$, is the expectation value of this Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues of the operator $L_z$ are $m_l\\hbar$, where $m_l$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number (denoted as 'm' in the question).\nThe term in the parenthesis is the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$.\n$ \\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T} $\nSo, the energy shift is:\n$ \\langle H \\rangle = m_l \\mu_B B $\nThe problem specifies a magnetic field of $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$ and \"small values of m\". Let's take a small, non-zero integer value for the magnetic quantum number, for instance, $m_l = 1$.\n$ \\langle H \\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV} $\n\n### 3. Comparison\n\nNow we compare the two energy values:\n*   Transition Energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n*   Paramagnetic Coupling Energy: $\\langle H \\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nLet's look at their ratio:\n$ \\frac{\\langle H \\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $\nThis ratio is extremely small, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the atomic transition energy.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E $\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nTo verify with a more precise calculation:\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# Constants\nh = const.h  # Planck constant in J.s\nc = const.c  # Speed of light in m/s\ne = const.e  # Elementary charge in C\nm_e = const.m_e # Electron mass in kg\nhbar = const.hbar # Reduced Planck constant in J.s\n\n# Given values\nwavelength_m = 0.4861e-6  # Wavelength in meters\nB_field = 1.0  # Magnetic field in Tesla\nm_l = 1  # A small integer for the magnetic quantum number\n\n# 1. Calculate transition energy (Delta E) in eV\ndelta_E_joules = (h * c) / wavelength_m\ndelta_E_eV = delta_E_joules / e\n\n# 2.
