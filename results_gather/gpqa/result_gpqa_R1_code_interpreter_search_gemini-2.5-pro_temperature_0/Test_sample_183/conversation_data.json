    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThis is a vicinal (1,2,3) trisubstituted benzene. The directing effects of the substituents are:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nSynthesizing such a sterically crowded molecule with this specific electronic arrangement requires a carefully planned multi-step synthesis, often involving blocking groups or building the molecule from a precursor where the directing effects align favorably.\n\n**2. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies**\n\nLet's think backward from the product (retrosynthesis).\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is an ether. The most common way to form an aryl ether is the Williamson ether synthesis. This involves reacting a phenoxide (from a phenol) with an alkyl halide.\n    *   Precursor: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n    *   Reaction: Deprotonation with a base (like NaOH) followed by reaction with an ethyl halide (like ethyl bromide, EtBr).\n    *   This corresponds to the reagent `NaOH/EtBr` found in the options.\n\n*   **Key Intermediate:** Our main challenge is to synthesize the precursor, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **Synthesizing the Key Intermediate:** How can we make 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol? Let's consider adding the substituents to a simpler ring.\n    *   **Path A: Start with m-nitrophenol and add a tert-butyl group.**\n        *   In m-nitrophenol (OH at C1, NO2 at C3), we need to add a t-Bu group at C2.\n        *   Let's check the directing effects for Friedel-Crafts alkylation:\n            *   The -OH group is a strong activator and directs *ortho* (to C2, C6) and *para* (to C4).\n            *   The -NO2 group is a strong deactivator and directs *meta* (to C5).\n            *   The powerful -OH group controls the reaction. It directs the incoming electrophile (the t-butyl cation) to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n            *   Alkylation at position 2 gives the desired product: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. While a mixture with 4- and 6-alkylated products is expected, this is a plausible way to form the required C-C bond at the correct position.\n\n    *   **Path B: Start with 2-tert-butylphenol and add a nitro group.**\n        *   In 2-tert-butylphenol (OH at C1, tBu at C2), we need to nitrate at C3.\n        *   Directing effects for nitration:\n            *   -OH directs *ortho* (C6) and *para* (C4).\n            *   -tBu directs *ortho* (C3) and *para* (C5).\n            *   The -OH group is a much stronger activator than -tBu and will dominate, leading to nitration at positions 4 and 6. This path will not yield the desired 3-nitro product.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** Path A is the more plausible route. The synthesis should proceed through m-nitrophenol.\n\n**3. Construct the Full Synthesis from Benzene**\n\nNow, let's build the full sequence, starting from benzene, to get to the final product via Path A.\n\n*   **Step 1: Synthesis of m-Nitrophenol from Benzene.**\n    This is a standard textbook synthesis:\n    a.  **Nitration:** Benzene is nitrated to form nitrobenzene. (Reagent: `HNO3/H2SO4`)\n    b.  **Second Nitration:** Nitrobenzene is nitrated again under harsher conditions. The -NO2 group is a meta-director, so this forms m-dinitrobenzene. (Reagent: `HNO3/H2SO4`)\n    c.  **Selective Reduction:** One of the two nitro groups in m-dinitrobenzene is selectively reduced to an amino group using a reagent like Na2S or (NH4)2S. The options provide `Fe/HCl`, which typically reduces all nitro groups, but for the sake of a multiple-choice question, we may have to assume it can be controlled or it's the intended reagent for reduction. This step yields m-nitroaniline. (Reagent: `Fe/HCl`)\n    d.  **Diazotization:** The amino group of m-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt. (Reagent: `NaNO2/HCl`)\n    e.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is heated in an aqueous acidic solution to replace the -N2+ group with an -OH group, forming m-nitrophenol. (Reagent: `H3O+, H2O/Heat`)\n\n*   **Step 2: Alkylation of m-Nitrophenol.**\n    f.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** m-Nitrophenol is reacted with tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst to introduce the tert-butyl group. As determined earlier, this can yield the desired 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. (Reagent: `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`)\n\n*   **Step 3: Etherification.**\n    g.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to its conjugate base with NaOH, which then reacts with ethyl bromide to form the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. (Reagent: `NaOH/EtBr`)\n\n**4. Match the Synthesis with the Given Options**\n\nLet's see which option provides the necessary reagents for this 7-step synthesis. The required reagents are:\n`HNO3/H2SO4` (used twice), `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`, `NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nLet's examine the reagent list for each option:\n*   **A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; v) dilute H2SO4 ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4\n*   C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr\n*   D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr\n\nOption A contains all the necessary reagents for our proposed synthesis:\n*   `HNO3/H2SO4` (listed twice, as ii and ix)\n*   `Fe/HCl` (listed as viii)\n*   `NaNO2/HCl` (listed as iv)\n*   `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (listed as vi)\n*   `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (listed as i)\n*   `NaOH/EtBr` (listed as vii)\n\nThe other options are missing key reagents or include steps that lead to the wrong isomer. For example, Option C involves Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (step iii), which is not a feasible reaction. Options B and D, through logical application of their steps, would lead to 1,2,4- or 1,3,4-substituted isomers, not the desired 1,2,3-isomer.\n\nAlthough the sequence of reactions in Option A is written in a scrambled and incorrect order, it is the only option that provides the complete set of reagents required for a plausible (though complex) synthesis of the target molecule. Therefore, it is the best choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
