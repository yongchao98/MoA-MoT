    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the momentum (`p`) of a photon that, when absorbed by a diatomic molecule (X-Y) in its ground state, causes it to transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Model:** The problem specifies the \"quantum rotation-vibration model\" (or non-rigid rotor). The energy levels in this model are described by two quantum numbers:\n    *   `v`: the vibrational quantum number (`v = 0, 1, 2, ...`)\n    *   `J`: the rotational quantum number (`J = 0, 1, 2, ...`)\n\n3.  **Write Down the Energy Formula:** The energy of a state `(v, J)` is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n    `E(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = (v + 1/2) * ħ * ω + B * J * (J + 1)`\n    where:\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`1.05457 x 10^-34 J·s`).\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as `B = ħ² / (2 * I)`.\n    *   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n4.  **Determine the Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state\" or ground state. This is the state with the absolute lowest energy, which corresponds to the lowest possible values for both quantum numbers: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   Initial state: `(v_i, J_i) = (0, 0)`.\n    *   Initial energy: `E_i = E(0, 0) = (0 + 1/2) * ħ * ω + B * 0 * (0 + 1) = (1/2) * ħ * ω`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final State:** The molecule transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". This is not simply the state with the next highest energy value. For a transition to occur via photon absorption (an electric dipole transition), specific **selection rules** must be obeyed:\n    *   `Δv = v_f - v_i = +1`\n    *   `ΔJ = J_f - J_i = ±1`\n\n    Applying these rules to our initial state `(v_i=0, J_i=0)`:\n    *   `v_f = v_i + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n    *   `J_f = J_i ± 1 = 0 ± 1`. Since `J` cannot be negative, the only possibility is `J_f = +1`.\n\n    Therefore, the final state must be `(v_f, J_f) = (1, 1)`. This is the lowest energy state that is accessible from the ground state via photon absorption.\n    *   Final energy: `E_f = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2) * ħ * ω + B * 1 * (1 + 1) = (3/2) * ħ * ω + 2B`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Photon's Energy:** The energy of the absorbed photon (`ΔE`) must be equal to the difference in energy between the final and initial states.\n    `ΔE = E_f - E_i`\n    `ΔE = [(3/2) * ħ * ω + 2B] - [(1/2) * ħ * ω]`\n    `ΔE = ħ * ω + 2B`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Required Physical Constants (`I` and `B`):**\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):** The molecule consists of atoms X and Y.\n        `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`\n        `Mx = 20 amu`, `My = 2 amu`\n        `μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20 / 11 amu`\n        Convert amu to kg: `1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg`.\n        `μ = (20 / 11) * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg)`\n\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):** For a diatomic molecule, `I = μ * R²`.\n        `R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10^-10 m`.\n        `I = [(20 / 11) * 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg] * (2 x 10^-10 m)²`\n\n    *   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n        `B = ħ² / (2 * I)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Total Energy `ΔE`:**\n    Now we have all the components to calculate `ΔE = ħ * ω + 2B`.\n    *   The first term is the vibrational energy change: `ħ * ω`.\n    *   The second term is the rotational energy change: `2B`.\n\n9.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum:** The energy of a photon is related to its momentum (`p`) by the equation `E = p * c`, where `c` is the speed of light (`~3.00 x 10^8 m/s`).\n    Therefore, `p = ΔE / c`.\n\n10. **Execute the Calculation:** Use a script to perform the numerical calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nMx = 20  # amu\nMy = 2   # amu\nR = 2e-10  # meters (2 angstroms)\nw = 4e14   # rad/s\namu_to_kg = 1.660539e-27  # kg\nh_bar = 1.0545718e-34    # J*s\nc = 2.99792458e8         # m/s\n\n# 1.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Model and Energy Levels**\n\nThe problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule. The energy of a specific state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...), is given by:\n\nE(v, J) = E_vibrational + E_rotational = (v + 1/2)ħω + B*J*(J+1)\n\nwhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, which depends on the molecule's moment of inertia `I`.\n\n**2. Identify the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum values: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   Initial State: `(v_i, J_i) = (0, 0)`\n    *   Initial Energy: E_i = E(0, 0) = (0 + 1/2)ħω + B*0*(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" For a transition via photon absorption, specific selection rules must be followed:\n    *   Δv = v_f - v_i = +1\n    *   ΔJ = J_f - J_i = ±1\n\n    Applying these rules to our initial state (0, 0):\n    *   `v_f = v_i + 1 = 1`\n    *   `J_f = J_i ± 1 = 0 ± 1`. Since `J` cannot be negative, the only allowed transition is to `J_f = 1`.\n\n    Therefore, the final state is:\n    *   Final State: `(v_f, J_f) = (1, 1)`\n    *   Final Energy: E_f = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B*1*(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\n**3. Calculate the Photon's Energy (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\nΔE = E_f - E_i\nΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]\nΔE = ħω + 2B\n\nTo find ΔE, we first need to calculate the rotational constant `B`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Rotational Constant (B)**\n\nThe rotational constant is `B = ħ² / (2I)`, where `I` is the moment of inertia.\nThe moment of inertia is `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass.\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):** We need to convert all units to SI units (kg, m).\n    *   μ (in kg) = 1.818 amu * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu)\n    *   R (in m) = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   I = μ * R²\n\nNow we can put all the pieces together and calculate the final momentum.\n\n**5. Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum by `E = pc`, where `c` is the speed of light. Therefore, the photon's momentum is:\n\np = ΔE / c = (ħω + 2B) / c\n\nWe will use a Python script to perform the numerical calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values and physical constants in SI units\nMx = 20.0  # amu\nMy = 2.0   # amu\nR = 2.0e-10  # meters (2 angstroms)\nw = 4.0e14   # rad/s\n\namu_to_kg = 1.660539e-27  # Conversion factor for atomic mass unit to kg\nh_bar = 1.0545718e-34    # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\nc = 2.99792458e8         # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the reduced mass (mu) in kg\nmu = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) * amu_to_kg\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu * R**2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the rotational constant (B) in Joules\nB = h_bar**2 / (2 * I)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the energy of the absorbed photon (Delta_E)\n# Delta_E = h_bar*w + 2B\nDelta_E = (h_bar * w) + (2 * B)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the momentum of the photon (p)\np = Delta_E / c\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"{p=}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\np=1.408991133999913e-28\n</execute_output>\nThe calculated momentum is approximately 1.409 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s.
