    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the given organic molecule, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The standard state for carbon is solid graphite (C(s)), and for hydrogen is gaseous hydrogen molecules (H2(g)).\n\nThe overall reaction is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe will use Hess's Law and the provided bond energy data to calculate this. The general formula is:\nΔH_f = (Sum of enthalpies of atomization of elements) - (Sum of bond energies in the compound)\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\nFirst, we need to determine the molecular formula and count the number of each type of bond in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Structure Analysis and Atom Count:**\n    *   `(CH3)2C=`: One central carbon double-bonded to the next carbon, and single-bonded to two methyl (CH3) groups. (3 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens)\n    *   `=CH-`: One carbon, single-bonded to the next carbon, and bonded to one hydrogen. (1 Carbon, 1 Hydrogen)\n    *   `-CH2-`: One carbon, bonded to two hydrogens. (1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens)\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-`: One carbon, bonded to one hydrogen and one methyl group. (2 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens)\n    *   `-CH2-`: One carbon, bonded to two hydrogens. (1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens)\n    *   `-CH=`: One carbon, double-bonded to the next carbon, and bonded to one hydrogen. (1 Carbon, 1 Hydrogen)\n    *   `=C(CH3)2`: One central carbon, single-bonded to two methyl groups. (3 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens)\n\n*   **Total Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbons (C): 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure: `C=C`. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** The total number of bonds in the carbon skeleton (a non-cyclic chain) is (Number of C atoms) - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = 9.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. It's the sum of all the bond energies.\nΔH_atom(compound) = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\nUsing the given values:\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom(compound) = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atom(compound) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (12 moles of C(s) and 11 moles of H2(g)) into gaseous atoms (12 moles of C(g) and 22 moles of H(g)).\nΔH_atom(elements) = (12 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\nUsing the given values:\n*   ΔH_atom(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom(elements) = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΔH_atom(elements) = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\nNow, we apply the main formula:\nΔH_f = ΔH_atom(elements) - ΔH_atom(compound)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n**6. Convert to the Units in the Options**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options:\nA) 11200 kJ/mol\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 1900 kJ/g\n\nOur result in kJ/mol (1900) does not match options A or B. Option D has the correct number but the wrong units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). Let's convert our result to kJ/g and check against option C.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol\n\n*   **Conversion:**\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, I will use a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_HH = 100  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC = 200  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_double_C = 300  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CH = 400  # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular formula is C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of bonds in the molecule\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\nnum_C_double_C_bonds = 2\n# Total bonds in carbon skeleton = num_C - 1 = 11\n# num_CC_bonds = total skeleton bonds - double bonds\nnum_CC_bonds = 11 - 2\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the sum of bond energies for the compound (enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\nsum_of_bond_energies = (num_CC_bonds * bond_energy_CC) + \\\n                       (num_C_double_C_bonds * bond_energy_C_double_C) + \\\n                       (num_CH_bonds * bond_energy_CH)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the sum of enthalpies of atomization for the elements\n# We need 12 moles of C atoms and 11 moles of H2 molecules\nsum_of_atomization_energies = (num_C * enthalpy_atomization_C) + \\\n                              ((num_H / 2) * bond_energy_HH)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_of_formation_mol = sum_of_atomization_energies - sum_of_bond_energies\n\n# Step 4: Convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\n# Molar mass of C12H22 (using integer masses C=12, H=1)\nmolar_mass = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)\nenthalpy_of_formation_gram = enthalpy_of_formation_mol / molar_mass\n\n# Print the final result that matches one of the options\nprint(f\"{enthalpy_of_formation_gram:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n11.45\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to find the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the molecule: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Count Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Count Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from (CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n*   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each type of bond:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure (`C=C`). So, there are **2** C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C bonds:** The carbon atoms form a chain. In a non-cyclic molecule, the total number of bonds connecting the carbon atoms is (Number of C atoms) - 1. So, there are 12 - 1 = 11 total links in the carbon skeleton. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9**.\n\n**2. Define the Formation Reaction**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is the enthalpy change for the reaction where one mole of the compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\nThe reaction is:\n12 C(solid) + 11 H2(gas) → C12H22(gas)\n\n**3. Apply Hess's Law using Bond Energies**\n\nWe can calculate the enthalpy of formation using the following formula, which is a form of Hess's Law:\n\nΔH_f = (Sum of enthalpies of atomization of elements) - (Sum of bond energies of the product)\n\n**Step 3a: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\nThis is the energy required to turn the reactants (12 moles of solid Carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms.\n\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon = 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds = 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total enthalpy of atomization of elements** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3b: Calculate the Sum of Bond Energies in the Product**\nThis is the energy released when all the bonds in one mole of C12H22 are formed from gaseous atoms. It is equivalent to the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × BE(C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × BE(C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × BE(C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total bond energy in the product** = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy in product)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Convert to the Correct Units**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. This does not match options A or B. Option D has the correct number but incorrect units (kJ/g). Let's convert our answer to kJ/g to check against option C.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol\n\n*   **Convert ΔH_f to kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
