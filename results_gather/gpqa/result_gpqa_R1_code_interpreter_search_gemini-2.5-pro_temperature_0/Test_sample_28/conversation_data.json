    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the genetic mutations in each mutant line and determine which one is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound. A non-functional protein is most reliably produced by a mutation that severely disrupts the gene's reading frame or introduces a premature stop codon.\n\nLet's break down the DNA sequence into codons (three-base units) and translate them into amino acids for the intact gene and each mutant. The standard genetic code will be used for translation. The gene starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene Sequence:**\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’`\n*   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp - Glu - His - Ile - Tyr - Cys - Arg...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAC`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes one amino acid.\n*   **Effect:** A single amino acid change might or might not inactivate the protein. Its function could be reduced, altered, or unaffected. It is not the most certain way to eliminate function.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. This is a silent mutation (Phe).\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAA`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. The translation will terminate after the second amino acid, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This truncated protein will be non-functional. This is the most likely mutation to completely eliminate the synthesis of the target compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAC`. Missense mutation (Leu -> Tyr).\n    *   Codon 6: `ACT` -> `GTC`. `ACT` codes for Threonine (Thr), while `GTC` codes for Valine (Val). This is another **missense mutation**.\n*   **Effect:** This mutant has two amino acid changes. While this increases the chance of disrupting the protein's function compared to a single missense mutation, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon. The protein is still fully translated.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact: The mutant sequence is shorter.\n    *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...` (Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...)\n    *   Mutant: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...` (Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...)\n    *   The sequence `CTC GCT GGT` (coding for Leu-Ala-Gly) in the intact gene has been effectively changed to `TAC GCT` (coding for Tyr-Ala), and the reading frame continues from there. This represents a combination of a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of one codon (`GGT`).\n*   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (deletion of 3 bases) combined with a missense mutation. The protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another changed (Leu to Tyr), but the rest of the protein will be translated correctly. This might inactivate the protein, but like missense mutations, the outcome is not as certain as a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective mutation for eliminating a protein's function is the one that causes the most severe disruption. A nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a severely truncated and guaranteed non-functional protein. The other mutations (missense and in-frame deletion) result in a full-length or near-full-length protein with one or two amino acid changes, which may or may not be sufficient to eliminate its function. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable candidate to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>"
