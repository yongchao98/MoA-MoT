As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of each gene based on single-mutant phenotypes.**\n    *   The wild-type (WT) has 100% resistance.\n    *   `g1` mutant has 75% resistance. This means gene G1 contributes to the resistance, and its loss reduces resistance by 25%.\n    *   `g2` mutant has 0% resistance. This means gene G2 is absolutely essential for any resistance. Its loss completely abolishes the phenotype.\n    *   `g3` mutant has 50% resistance. This means gene G3 contributes significantly to resistance, and its loss reduces resistance by 50%.\n\n2.  **Analyze the interactions between genes using the double-mutant phenotypes.** This is primarily done by looking for epistasis, where the mutation in one gene masks the effect of a mutation in another gene.\n\n    *   **Interaction between G1 and G2:**\n        *   `g1` phenotype = 75%\n        *   `g2` phenotype = 0%\n        *   `g1g2` double-mutant phenotype = 0%\n        *   The phenotype of the `g1g2` double mutant is identical to the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant. This is a classic case of epistasis. It means the `g2` mutation masks the `g1` mutation's effect. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n\n    *   **Interaction between G2 and G3:**\n        *   `g2` phenotype = 0%\n        *   `g3` phenotype = 50%\n        *   `g2g3` double-mutant phenotype = 0%\n        *   Similarly, the phenotype of the `g2g3` double mutant is identical to the `g2` single mutant. This means **G2 is also epistatic to G3**.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the findings about G2.**\n    *   G2 is essential for resistance (0% phenotype).\n    *   G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n    *   The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream. A gene that is essential and epistatic to other genes in the pathway is the strongest candidate for an upstream master regulator, such as a transcription factor that activates the other genes. Therefore, the conclusion that **G2 is a transcription factor** is strongly supported.\n\n4.  **Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3.**\n    *   `g1` phenotype = 75% (a 25% loss of resistance)\n    *   `g3` phenotype = 50% (a 50% loss of resistance)\n    *   If the genes acted independently, we would expect the combined loss of resistance to be roughly the sum of the individual losses (25% + 50% = 75% loss), leading to about 25% remaining resistance.\n    *   The observed `g1g3` double-mutant phenotype is 10% resistance (a 90% loss).\n    *   Since the combined effect (90% loss) is much greater than the sum of the individual effects (75% loss), this is a synergistic interaction. In genetics, this often indicates that the two genes have partially overlapping or **redundant functions**. When only one is lost, the other can partially compensate. When both are lost, the function is almost completely eliminated.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options based on the conclusions.**\n\n    *   **Conclusion 1:** G2 is a transcription factor. (Supports A, B, C; contradicts D).\n    *   **Conclusion 2:** G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. (Supports A).\n    *   **Conclusion 3:** G2 is epistatic to G1. (Supports D).\n    *   **Conclusion 4:** We cannot determine pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits) from this experiment. (Weakens B, D).\n    *   **Conclusion 5:** The claim \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is incorrect because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n    *   **Conclusion 6:** The claim \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is incorrect because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n6.  **Select the best option.**\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** This option correctly identifies G2 as a TF and correctly describes the G1-G3 interaction as redundancy. The last clause about epistasis is incorrect based on the data, but the first two points are the most significant and accurate conclusions from the experiment.\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** \"Pleiotropy\" cannot be concluded from the data.\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.** \"Same promoter\" is a hypothesis, not a conclusion from this data. The epistasis claim is incorrect.\n    *   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.** The claim that G1 is a TF is contradicted by the data (G2 has the stronger, epistatic phenotype).\n\nOption A contains the two most important and correct conclusions derived from the experimental data, even though its third clause appears to be flawed. It provides the best overall description of the genetic pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>"
