    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in stars, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The physical law that governs the distribution of particles among energy states in thermal equilibrium is the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann equation:** The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in an excited state (let's call it state 2) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (state 1, often the ground state).\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   N₂ is the number of atoms in the excited state.\n    *   N₁ is the number of atoms in the lower state.\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the two states.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to both stars:** We need to write the Boltzmann equation for star_1 (with temperature T₁) and star_2 (with temperature T₂). The energy levels of the iron atom are the same in both stars, so ΔE, g₁, and g₂ are constants.\n\n    *   For star_1: (N₂ / N₁)_₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n    *   For star_2: (N₂ / N₁)_₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the lower state is twice as large for star_1 as it is for star_2.\n    (N₂ / N₁)_₁ = 2 * (N₂ / N₁)_₂\n\n5.  **Combine the equations:** Substitute the Boltzmann expressions from step 3 into the relation from step 4.\n    (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the combined equation:** The term for the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) is the same on both sides and can be canceled out.\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n7.  **Solve for the relationship between T₁ and T₂:** To isolate the temperatures, we can use logarithms. First, rearrange the equation:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) = 2\n\n    Using the exponent rule eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ:\n    exp( -ΔE / (k * T₁) - (-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ) = 2\n    exp( ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁) ) = 2\n\n    Now, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln[ exp( ΔE/k * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ) ] = ln(2)\n    ΔE/k * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    ΔE/k * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ] = ln(2)\n\n8.  **Substitute the given numerical values:** The problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant is a fundamental physical constant, k ≈ 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\n    Let's calculate the value of the pre-factor (ΔE / k):\n    (ΔE / k) = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\n    The problem is designed such that this factor is approximately 1.\n\n9.  **Finalize the equation:** Substitute the value (ΔE / k) ≈ 1 back into the equation from step 7.\n    1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nThis equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
