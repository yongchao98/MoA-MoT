    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the core physics:** The problem describes particles that decay over time. The number of undecayed particles `N` at a time `t` follows an exponential decay law:\n    N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)\n    where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `T` is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Incorporate Time Dilation:** The mean lifetime `T` measured in the lab frame is dilated due to the particle's high velocity. It relates to the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    T = γ * τ\n    The proper lifetime `τ` is an intrinsic property of the particle type and does not change.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Decay Equation:** Substituting the dilated lifetime into the decay equation, we get:\n    N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / (γτ))\n\n4.  **Determine the Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector with radius `R = 30 m`. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, meaning their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to reach the detector wall is:\n    t = R / v ≈ R / c\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** We can now express the fraction of particles `(N/N₀)` that reach the detector wall by substituting the time of flight `t` into our decay equation:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ))\n    N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γcτ))\n\n6.  **Analyze the Given Conditions:** The term `R/(cτ)` is a constant for this experiment because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change. Let's call this constant `K`:\n    K = R / (cτ)\n    So, the fraction `f = N/N₀` is given by:\n    f = exp(-K / γ)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Unknowns:** We can rearrange the equation to solve for `γ`:\n    ln(f) = -K / γ\n    -ln(f) = K / γ\n    ln(1/f) = K / γ\n    γ * ln(1/f) = K\n\n    Since `K` is a constant, we can equate the expressions for the two scenarios given in the problem.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n        *   Fraction reaching the detector, f₁ = 1/3\n        *   K = γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = 20 * ln(1/(1/3)) = 20 * ln(3)\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, γ₂ = ?\n        *   Fraction reaching the detector, f₂ = 2/3\n        *   K = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂) = γ₂ * ln(1/(2/3)) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** By equating the two expressions for `K`, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)\n    γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\n    To get a numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem\ngamma1 = 20\nf1 = 1/3\nf2 = 2/3\n\n# From the derived relationship: gamma2 * ln(1/f2) = gamma1 * ln(1/f1)\n# gamma2 * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)\n# We solve for gamma2.\n\ngamma2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(3/2)\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n>54.18508485133395\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` is approximately 54.19. This value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The fraction of particles `f` that survive after traveling a distance `R` is given by the exponential decay law in the lab frame:\n`f = N/N₀ = exp(-t / T)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N` is the number of particles that reach the detector.\n*   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n*   `t` is the time of flight in the lab frame.\n*   `T` is the mean lifetime of the particles in the lab frame.\n\nThe time of flight `t` for a particle traveling at a velocity `v` to the detector wall of radius `R` is `t = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t ≈ R/c`.\n\nThe mean lifetime `T` in the lab frame is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the time dilation formula:\n`T = γ * τ`\nwhere `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get:\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `K = R / (cτ)`. This value is constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the proper lifetime `τ` of the particle type do not change between the two scenarios. The equation becomes:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe can solve for `K` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(f) = -K / γ`\n`K = -γ * ln(f) = γ * ln(1/f)`\n\nNow we can use the information from the two scenarios to find the unknown Lorentz factor.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `f₁ = 1/3`\n\n`K = γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = 20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?`\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n`K = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂) = γ₂ * ln(1 / (2/3)) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nSince `K` is the same in both scenarios, we can set the two expressions for `K` equal to each other:\n`γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nNow, we solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\nUsing the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is closest to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
