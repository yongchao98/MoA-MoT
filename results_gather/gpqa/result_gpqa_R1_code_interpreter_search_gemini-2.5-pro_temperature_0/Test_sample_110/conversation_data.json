    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone. Ketones can be deprotonated at the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) to form an enolate.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n        *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it has no α-hydrogens.\n        *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and one hydrogen. This is the only position where deprotonation can occur.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which is an excellent Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base used to generate the enolate.\n    *   The combination of a ketone (enolate precursor), an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (Michael acceptor), and a base points to a **Michael addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, removes the acidic α-proton from the C6 position of the cyclohexanone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The C6 of the enolate then attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the carbon of the C=C double bond that is further from the ester group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A subsequent protonation step (usually during workup) neutralizes the intermediate to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The group added to C6 is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   The final structure has the cyclohexanone ring with the following substituents:\n        *   C1: Carbonyl group (C=O)\n        *   C2: An ethyl group and a methyl group.\n        *   C6: A methyl group and a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group (an ethyl propanoate chain attached at C3).\n\n4.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. Let's follow this convention.\n    *   The parent chain is ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent attached to C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment as C1. The numbering proceeds to give the principal functional group (the oxo group) the lowest possible number.\n        *   C1: Point of attachment (this was C6 of the original ketone). It has a methyl group.\n        *   C2: The carbonyl group (oxo).\n        *   C3: Has an ethyl group and a methyl group (this was C2 of the original ketone).\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the structure for A given in options A and C.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The electron-withdrawing nitro group makes the protons on the α-carbon (C1) acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, which is a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the 1-nitropropane.\n    *   This is another example of a **Michael addition reaction** (specifically, a nitro-Michael addition).\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   KOH removes an α-proton from 1-nitropropane to form a carbanion (a nitronate anion), `CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`.\n    *   This carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (the carbon of the C=C double bond attached to the methyl group).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n    *   Protonation by water (H₂O) gives the final product.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The new bond connects the `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)` fragment to the `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` fragment.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n4.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The nitrile group (-CN) has higher priority for naming than the nitro group (-NO₂).\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon is six carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the structure for B given in options A and B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This eliminates options B and D.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is **A**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
