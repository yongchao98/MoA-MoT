    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass % H = (mass of H) / (total mass) * 100%`.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm. The mass is `12n + m` (using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1).\n    *   The mass fraction of H is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This value, 14.28%, is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`).\n    *   So, `m / (12n + m) ≈ 1/7`, which gives `7m ≈ 12n + m`, so `6m ≈ 12n`, which simplifies to `m ≈ 2n`.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n can be an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means the components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is the cycloalkane Z (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means the other component of Y, let's call it Y2, must also be converted to Z upon hydrogenation.\n    *   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene/alkyne. For it to be hydrogenated to a cycloalkane Z (CnH2n), Y2 is most likely an aromatic hydrocarbon. The hydrogenation of an aromatic ring requires severe conditions, which is mentioned in the problem.\n    *   The most common and stable aromatic hydrocarbons are based on a benzene ring. Let's assume the simplest case, where the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring (n=6).\n    *   This makes Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound Y2 would be benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check if this fits: Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6 + 3H2) gives cyclohexane (C6H12). This is consistent.\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (Z) and benzene. Both are liquids and neither decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. This fits all the criteria for Y.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2, that undergoes disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst to form an equimolar mixture of Y = (cyclohexane, benzene).\n    *   The overall reaction is: `X1 + X2 -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. To balance the atoms, the total formula of the reactants must be C12H18. Since X is an equimolar mixture, each molecule on average has the formula C6H9.\n    *   Let X1 be C6Ha and X2 be C6Hb. Since the mixture is equimolar, the average number of hydrogen atoms is `(a + b) / 2 = 9`, which means `a + b = 18`.\n    *   The components of X decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated. They must also have a C6 ring skeleton because their hydrogenation leads to cyclohexane.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X.\n    *   Let's look for possible unsaturated C6-ring compounds:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). It has one double bond (non-conjugated). `a = 10`.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8). It has two non-conjugated double bonds. `b = 8`. (1,3-Cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n    *   Let's check if these two compounds fit the condition `a + b = 18`.\n    *   `10 + 8 = 18`. Yes, they fit perfectly.\n    *   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Process:**\n    *   **X**: Equimolar mix of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both are unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n    *   **Reaction**: `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`. This is a known catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction. 1,4-cyclohexadiene acts as the hydrogen donor (is oxidized to benzene), and cyclohexene acts as the hydrogen acceptor (is reduced to cyclohexane). The reaction produces an equimolar mixture of products.\n    *   **Y**: Equimolar mix of cyclohexane and benzene. Both are \"saturated\" towards bromine water.\n    *   **Z**: Cyclohexane (C6H12). It is a component of Y, a common solvent, and fits the mass percentage of hydrogen.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of X**: `C6H10 + H2 -> C6H12` and `C6H8 + 2H2 -> C6H12`. Both give only Z.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of Y**: `C6H12 -> C6H12` and `C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12`. Both give only Z.\n    *   All conditions of the problem are satisfied.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Liquid 1 (X1) is cyclohexene (C6H10), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (X2) is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
