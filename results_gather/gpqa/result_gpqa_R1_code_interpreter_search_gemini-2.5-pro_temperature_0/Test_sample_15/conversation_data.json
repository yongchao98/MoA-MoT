    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral and are not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers). However, molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral if they possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such compounds are called meso compounds. When a compound is named with specific stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S), it refers to a single enantiomer, which is optically active by definition.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is essentially planar.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   It has no chiral centers.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound is achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The important part of the name for this question is the stereochemical designation `(3aR,7aS,...)`.\n    *   The `R` and `S` descriptors indicate that the molecule has chiral centers at positions 3a and 7a, and their absolute configurations are specified.\n    *   Naming a compound as a specific stereoisomer (e.g., (3aR, 7aS)) implies that we are considering a pure sample of that single enantiomer.\n    *   A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound is a specific enantiomer and is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric, with identical groups (COOH) at both ends.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (2R, 3S), meaning the two chiral centers have opposite configurations.\n    *   In a molecule with two chiral centers and identical ends, the (R,S) stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   This makes the compound a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound is a meso compound and is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (2R, 3R), meaning both chiral centers have the same configuration.\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) compound.\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer, (2R, 3R).\n    *   Conclusion: This compound is a single enantiomer of a chiral pair and is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The carbon atom C1, bonded to the -OH group, is a chiral center. It is attached to four different groups: -OH, -H, a `-CH=CH-` path in the ring, and a `-CH2-CH2-` path in the ring.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration for this chiral center.\n    *   This means we are considering a single enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound is a single enantiomer and is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `s` designation indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the symmetry of this molecule. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) perpendicular to the average plane of the ring. It also has three vertical planes of symmetry (Ïƒv), each passing through a C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, even though carbons 1, 3, and 5 are stereocenters. This is another example of a meso-like achiral compound.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's search for any chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   There are no such carbon atoms in this molecule. The `CH` in the isobutyl group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. All other sp3 carbons are CH2 groups or are part of the symmetrical cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   The molecule is achiral. It possesses a plane of symmetry in a certain conformation.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
