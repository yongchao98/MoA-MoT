Define the System and Conservation Laws**\nThe problem involves a relativistic collision and annihilation. The fundamental principles we must use are the conservation of total energy and the conservation of momentum. We will analyze the system before and after the collision.\n\nLet $m_e$ be the rest mass of the electron (and positron) and $c$ be the speed of light.\n\n**2. Initial State (Before Collision)**\n\n*   **Electron:**\n    *   Moves in the positive x-direction.\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n    *   Energy: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum: The relationship between energy, momentum, and rest mass is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$.\n    *   $p_e c = \\sqrt{E_e^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(4 m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{15} m_e c^2$.\n    *   So, the electron's momentum is $p_e = \\sqrt{15} m_e c$ in the +x direction.\n\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   Moves in the negative x-direction.\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n    *   Energy: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum: $p_p c = \\sqrt{E_p^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(2 m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{3} m_e c^2$.\n    *   So, the positron's momentum is $p_p = \\sqrt{3} m_e c$ in the -x direction.\n\n**3. Total Initial Energy and Momentum**\n\n*   **Total Energy:**\n    $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n\n*   **Total Momentum:**\n    Momentum is a vector. Taking the +x direction as positive:\n    $P_{initial} = p_e - p_p = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$.\n    The total initial momentum is purely in the x-direction.\n\n**4. Final State (After Annihilation)**\n\n*   **Two Photons:**\n    *   The problem states they have equal energy. Let's call this energy $E_\\gamma$.\n    *   From the conservation of energy: $E_{final} = E_{\\gamma} + E_{\\gamma} = 2E_\\gamma$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final} \\implies 6 m_e c^2 = 2E_\\gamma \\implies E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$.\n    *   The momentum of a photon is given by $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c$. So, each photon has a momentum of magnitude $p_\\gamma = 3 m_e c$.\n\n*   **Photon Directions:**\n    *   One photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". Let the angle of the first photon with the x-axis be $\\theta$ and the second be $-\\phi$.\n    *   The momentum of the first photon has components: $(p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta)$.\n    *   The momentum of the second photon has components: $(p_\\gamma \\cos(-\\phi), p_\\gamma \\sin(-\\phi)) = (p_\\gamma \\cos\\phi, -p_\\gamma \\sin\\phi)$.\n\n**5. Applying Conservation of Momentum to the Final State**\n\n*   **Conservation in the y-direction:**\n    The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero. Therefore, the final momentum in the y-direction must also be zero.\n    $P_{final, y} = p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta - p_\\gamma \\sin\\phi = 0$.\n    This implies $\\sin\\theta = \\sin\\phi$. Since one angle is positive (upper) and one is negative (lower), their magnitudes must be equal: $\\theta = \\phi$.\n\n*   **Conservation in the x-direction:**\n    The initial momentum in the x-direction must equal the final momentum in the x-direction.\n    $P_{initial, x} = P_{final, x}$\n    $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta + p_\\gamma \\cos\\phi$.\n    Since $\\theta = \\phi$ and $p_\\gamma = 3 m_e c$:\n    $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 3 m_e c \\cos\\theta + 3 m_e c \\cos\\theta = 6 m_e c \\cos\\theta$.\n\n**6. Solving for the Angle**\n\nWe can cancel $m_e c$ from both sides:\n$\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} = 6 \\cos\\theta$\n$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n\nNow, we compute the value of $\\theta$ and then find the total angle between the photons, which is $2\\theta$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta)\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert theta to degrees\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The question asks for the angle between the two photons, which is theta + phi.\n# Since theta = phi, the total angle is 2 * theta.\ntotal_angle_deg = 2 * theta_deg\nprint(total_angle_deg)\n```\n```output\n138.1896851042214\n```\nThe calculated angle is approximately 138.19 degrees. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",

Understand the Physics**\n\nThis problem involves a relativistic collision where an electron and a positron annihilate to produce two photons. The key principles to apply are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum.\n\n**2. Define Initial State (Before Annihilation)**\n\nLet $m_e$ be the rest mass of the electron (and positron) and $c$ be the speed of light. The x-axis is the horizontal axis.\n\n*   **Electron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n    *   It moves from the left, so its velocity is in the +x direction.\n    *   Energy: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum: The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$.\n    *   $p_e c = \\sqrt{E_e^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(4 m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{16 - 1} \\cdot m_e c^2 = \\sqrt{15} m_e c^2$.\n    *   So, the electron's momentum is $p_e = \\sqrt{15} m_e c$ in the +x direction.\n\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n    *   It moves from the right, so its velocity is in the -x direction.\n    *   Energy: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum: $p_p c = \\sqrt{E_p^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(2 m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{4 - 1} \\cdot m_e c^2 = \\sqrt{3} m_e c^2$.\n    *   So, the positron's momentum is $p_p = \\sqrt{3} m_e c$ in the -x direction.\n\n**3. Calculate Total Initial Energy and Momentum**\n\n*   **Total Energy (Initial):**\n    $E_{total} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n\n*   **Total Momentum (Initial):**\n    Momentum is a vector. Let the +x direction be positive.\n    $P_{total, x} = p_e - p_p = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$.\n    The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero, $P_{total, y} = 0$.\n\n**4. Define Final State (After Annihilation)**\n\n*   **Two Photons:**\n    *   The problem states they have equal energy. Let this energy be $E_\\gamma$.\n    *   By conservation of energy: $E_{total} = E_{\\gamma,1} + E_{\\gamma,2} = 2E_\\gamma$.\n    *   $6 m_e c^2 = 2E_\\gamma \\implies E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$.\n    *   For a photon, momentum $p = E/c$. So, each photon has a momentum of magnitude $p_\\gamma = \\frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c$.\n\n*   **Photon Directions:**\n    *   One photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". This means they move at angles $\\theta$ and $-\\phi$ with respect to the horizontal (x-axis).\n    *   The total initial momentum is in the +x direction, so the center of mass is moving to the right. This explains why both photons are directed to the right.\n\n**5. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   **Conservation in the y-direction:**\n    The initial y-momentum is 0. The final y-momentum must also be 0.\n    $P_{final, y} = p_\\gamma \\sin(\\theta) + p_\\gamma \\sin(-\\phi) = 0$\n    $p_\\gamma \\sin(\\theta) - p_\\gamma \\sin(\\phi) = 0$\n    $\\sin(\\theta) = \\sin(\\phi)$. Since the angles are on opposite sides of the axis, this means their magnitudes are equal: $\\theta = \\phi$.\n\n*   **Conservation in the x-direction:**\n    The initial x-momentum must equal the final x-momentum.\n    $P_{initial, x} = P_{final, x}$\n    $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) + p_\\gamma \\cos(-\\phi)$\n    Since $\\theta = \\phi$ and $\\cos(-\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)$:\n    $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) + p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$\n\n**6. Solve for the Angle**\n\nNow, substitute the value of $p_\\gamma = 3 m_e c$:\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 (3 m_e c) \\cos(\\theta)$\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 6 m_e c \\cos(\\theta)$\n\nCancel $m_e c$ from both sides:\n$\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n$\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.873$\n$\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n$\\cos(\\theta) \\approx \\frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \\frac{2.141}{6} \\approx 0.3568$\n$\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the directions of the photons. This is the total angle, which is $\\theta + \\phi = 2\\theta$.\nTotal Angle = $2 \\times 69.1^\\circ = 138.2^\\circ$.\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\nFinal check with the code output: The precise calculation gives 138.19 degrees, which rounds to 138.\n\n<<<A>>>"
