    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Radiating Source:** The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroid shape and a symmetry axis (z-axis). In the context of electromagnetic radiation, an oscillating charge distribution can be analyzed using a multipole expansion. The simplest and most common type of radiation comes from an oscillating electric dipole, which is the lowest order term in the expansion. Unless specific symmetries are described that would cancel out the dipole moment, it is standard to assume that the electric dipole radiation is the dominant mechanism. The spheroid shape with a symmetry axis is consistent with an effective electric dipole oscillating along that axis.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:** For an electric dipole `p` oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) in the radiation zone (far-field) is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = C₁ * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis) and `C₁` is a constant that depends on the dipole moment amplitude and frequency, but not on the angle `θ`.\n\n3.  **Find the Maximum Radiated Power (A):** The function `sin²(θ)` has a maximum value of 1, which occurs when `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    The maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, `A`, is therefore proportional to this maximum value:\n    `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C₁ * sin²(90°) = C₁ * 1 = C₁`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Power at θ = 30°:** We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We use the same formula:\n    `(dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°) = C₁ * sin²(30°)`\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    So, `(dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°) = C₁ * (1/4) = A/4`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Fraction:** The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is:\n    `Fraction = [(dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°)] / A = (A/4) / A = 1/4`\n    This narrows down the possible answers to options B and C.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Wavelength (λ) Dependence:** Now, we need to determine how the radiated power depends on the wavelength `λ`. The full formula for the power per unit solid angle from an oscillating electric dipole is:\n    `dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32 π² ε₀ c³) * sin²(θ)`\n    Here, `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation. The power is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n    The relationship between angular frequency `ω`, the speed of light `c`, and wavelength `λ` is:\n    `ω = 2πν = 2π(c/λ)`\n    Substituting this into the proportionality for power:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n    This type of scattering, where the power is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`, is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n\n7.  **Combine the Results:**\n    *   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n    *   The possible form of the function `f`'s dependence on wavelength is **`λ⁻⁴`**.\n\n8.  **Select the Correct Option:** Matching these two results with the given options:\n    A) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n    B) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n    C) 1/4, λ⁻³\n    D) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n\n    The correct option is B.\n\n*(Self-Correction/Alternative Check: Option D corresponds to electric quadrupole radiation, which has a power dependence of `λ⁻⁶` and an angular dependence of `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`. This would yield a fraction of 3/4 at 30°. However, dipole radiation is the lowest-order and dominant mechanism for a simple oscillating charge distribution, making it the most reasonable assumption.)*\n\n<<<B>>>"
