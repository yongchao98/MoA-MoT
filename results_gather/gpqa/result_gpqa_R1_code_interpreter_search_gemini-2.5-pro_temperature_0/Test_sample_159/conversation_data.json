    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` will approach a circle of radius `a` as the number of sides `N` approaches infinity. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture is given by the Airy pattern:\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\n\nWhere:\n*   `I₀` is the intensity at the center of the pattern.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `θ` is the angular distance from the central axis.\n\nThe minima (dark rings) of the diffraction pattern occur when the numerator is zero, which means `J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0`.\nLet `x = k * a * sin(θ)`.

    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` will approach a circle of radius `a` as the number of sides `N` approaches infinity. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which becomes the radius of the inscribed circle. As N becomes infinitely large, the polygon becomes indistinguishable from this inscribed circle.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern:\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\n\nWhere:\n*   `I₀` is the intensity at the center of the pattern (the central maximum).\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k` is the wave number, defined as `k = 2π / λ`, where `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `θ` is the angular distance from the central axis.\n\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator of the expression is zero, which means `J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0`, provided the denominator is not also zero (which corresponds to the central maximum).\n\nLet `x = k * a * sin(θ)`. The minima correspond to the non-zero roots (zeros) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. Let these roots be `z₁, z₂, z₃, ...`.\n\nWe are given that the angles are small, so we can use the small-angle approximation: `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is:\n`k * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSubstituting `k = 2π / λ`, we get:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m` of the m-th minimum:\n`θ_m = (z_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n*   The first minimum (`m=1`) occurs at `θ₁ = (z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)`.\n*   The second minimum (`m=2`) occurs at `θ₂ = (z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)`.\n\nThe angular distance is:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)] - [(z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)]`\n`Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n\nNow, we need the values of the first two non-zero zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. These are well-known values:\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow we can calculate the coefficient `(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)`:\n`Coefficient = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * π) = 3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159...) ≈ 0.5067`\n\nSo, the angular distance is:\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\nThis value is very close to the one given in option D. The calculation performed by the code confirms this result, yielding `0.507` when rounded to three decimal places.\n\nLet's analyze the other options:\n*   A) `1.220 λ / a`: This is related to the Rayleigh criterion, but for a diameter `a`, not radius `a`. The position of the first minimum is `θ₁ = 1.22 λ / D = 1.22 λ / (2a) = 0.610 λ / a`.\n*   C) `0.610 λ / a`: This is the angular position of the *first* minimum (`θ₁`), not the distance between the first and second minima.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
