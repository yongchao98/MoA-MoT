    "The user wants to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2], in a solution with a given total cobalt concentration and thiocyanate concentration.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\nThe solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions, which form a series of complexes. The equilibrium reactions are:\n- Co^2+ + SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)]+\n- Co^2+ + 2SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)2]\n- Co^2+ + 3SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)3]-\n- Co^2+ + 4SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)4]2-\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]2-]\n\n**2. Use Stability Constants**\nThe overall stability constants (β) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion ([Co^2+]) and the free ligand ([SCN-]):\n- [[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]\n- [[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2\n- [[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3\n- [[Co(SCN)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4\n\n**3. Define the Distribution Coefficient (α)**\nThe fraction (or distribution coefficient, α) of a specific complex is the ratio of its concentration to the total metal concentration. We are interested in the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)2], so we need to find α2.\n\nα2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions from steps 1 and 2, we get:\nα2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β1*[Co^2+]*[SCN-] + β2*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]^4)\n\nThe [Co^2+] term is common in the numerator and all terms of the denominator, so it cancels out:\nα2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)\n\n**4. Make a Reasonable Assumption**\nThe total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M = 0.01 M.\nThe thiocyanate concentration is [SCN-] = 0.1 M.\nSince the thiocyanate concentration is 10 times larger than the total cobalt concentration, the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt will be relatively small. Therefore, we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] as its initial total concentration, 0.1 M.\n\n**5. Calculate the Value**\nNow, we plug the given values into the formula for α2:\n- [SCN-] = 0.1 M\n- β1 = 9\n- β2 = 40\n- β3 = 63\n- β4 = 16\n\nLet's calculate the denominator first:\nDenominator = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1^2) + (63 * 0.1^3) + (16 * 0.1^4)\nDenominator = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nDenominator = 2.3646\n\nNow, calculate the numerator:\nNumerator = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nFinally, calculate α2:\nα2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)2] = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\nTo verify the calculation, I will use a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The denominator of the alpha fraction formula\n# Denominator = 1 + beta1*[SCN-] + beta2*[SCN-]^2 + beta3*[SCN-]^3 + beta4*[SCN-]^4\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * scn_conc**1 + beta2 * scn_conc**2 + beta3 * scn_conc**3 + beta4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# The numerator for the dithiocyanato complex (alpha_2)\n# Numerator = beta2 * [SCN-]^2\nnumerator_alpha2 = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha2 = numerator_alpha2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_alpha2 = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage_alpha2=}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**1. Define the species and equilibria:**\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`) to form a series of complexes:\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)]+`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)2]`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)3]-`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]2-]`\n\n**2. Use the overall stability constants (β):**\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]`, the free thiocyanate ion concentration `[SCN-]`, and the overall stability constants (`βn`):\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n**3. Determine the fraction of the desired complex:**\nThe fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)n]`, is denoted by `αn`. We are interested in `α2`, the fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]`:\n`α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from step 2 into the equation for `c(Co)`, we get:\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β1*[Co^2+]*[SCN-] + β2*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]^4)`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term is common to the numerator and all terms in the denominator, so it cancels out:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)`\n\n**4. Approximate the free ligand concentration:**\nThe total cobalt concentration (`10^-2 M`) is ten times smaller than the total thiocyanate concentration (`0.1 M`). Because the thiocyanate is in large excess, we can approximate the concentration of free thiocyanate at equilibrium, `[SCN-]`, with its initial total concentration.\n`[SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n**5. Calculate the fraction `α2`:**\nNow, we plug the given values into the formula:\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\nDenominator = `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1^2) + (63 * 0.1^3) + (16 * 0.1^4)`\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\nDenominator = `2.3646`\n\nNext, calculate the numerator:\nNumerator = `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nFinally, calculate `α2`:\n`α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**6. Convert to percentage:**\nTo find the percentage, multiply the fraction `α2` by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
