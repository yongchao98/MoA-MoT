    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group requires two key symmetry elements:\n1.  A principal C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 120° leaves the molecule unchanged).\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n\nLet's examine each molecule:\n\n**A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule has a triphenylene core, which is a flat polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. Three anhydride-like groups (furan-diones) are fused to the outer rings of the triphenylene system in a symmetrical, propeller-like fashion.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   There is a C3 axis passing through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A 120° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because the molecule is planar.\n    *   There are no C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, nor are there any vertical mirror planes (σv).\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule possesses a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane, and no higher symmetry elements that would place it in a different group. Therefore, its point group is **C3h**.\n\n**B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is also known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to it.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   The molecular plane is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   **However**, it also has additional symmetry elements: three C2 axes lying within the plane of the molecule and passing through the center, and three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of the C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane means the molecule's point group is **D3h**. While any D3h molecule contains the symmetry elements of the C3h group (C3h is a subgroup of D3h), its full symmetry is higher.\n\n**C) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure:** The formula is B(O-iPr)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms, each of which is bonded to a bulky, non-planar isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, the three isopropyl groups will likely arrange themselves in a propeller-like fashion.\n    *   This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 axis passing through the boron atom.\n    *   However, due to the non-planar, tetrahedral nature of the carbon atoms in the isopropyl groups, there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Conclusion:** The most stable conformation of this molecule belongs to the **C3** point group. It lacks the required σh plane for C3h symmetry.\n\n**D) quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the three ethylene bridges.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion:** The point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nComparing the four molecules, only **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone** has a point group of exactly C3h. While mellitic trianhydride (B) also has the necessary elements for C3h symmetry, its full symmetry is D3h. In questions of this type, the correct choice is the molecule whose highest-order point group is the one specified.\n\n<<<A>>>"
