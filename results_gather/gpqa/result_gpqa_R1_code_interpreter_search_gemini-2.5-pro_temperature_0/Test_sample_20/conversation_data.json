    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A)**\n\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen** (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n    2.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds and two ketone groups (C=O) in the para positions (1 and 4).\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the ring's double bonds.\n        *   These alpha-carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n        *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered saturated ring with three ketone groups.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n        *   The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows for keto-enol tautomerism.\n        *   In fact, this compound readily tautomerizes to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and thus very stable molecule.\n        *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B)**\n\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2). It is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  -H (hydrogen)\n            2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n            3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n            4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        *   Since C2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center.\n        *   The molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n        *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n    3.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid.\n        *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry in the middle of the double bond).\n        *   Molecules with a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n        *   Since it is achiral, it cannot have a non-superimposable mirror image.\n        *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
