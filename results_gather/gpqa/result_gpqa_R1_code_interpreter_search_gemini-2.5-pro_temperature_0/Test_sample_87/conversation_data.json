    "The user is describing an experiment that mimics an oral infection or vaccination. Let's break down the key events and observations:\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery:** GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins are delivered orally. Rotavirus is a gut pathogen.\n2.  **Antigen Uptake:** The fluorescent proteins reach the Peyer's patches, which are key secondary lymphoid organs in the gut responsible for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n3.  **Cellular Response:** In the Peyer's patches, a cell population is observed to be proliferating. This indicates an active immune response, specifically clonal expansion of lymphocytes that have recognized the antigen.\n4.  **Genetic Analysis:** The variable heavy chain gene of these proliferating cells is sequenced.\n5.  **Key Observation:** The sequencing reveals \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options in the context of this experiment:\n\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that generates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow during the development of naive B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The process described in the question is happening in a secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch) *after* antigen exposure. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the constant region of the antibody heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which alters the effector function of the antibody. It does *not* affect the variable region, which is responsible for antigen binding. The question specifically states that the variability is in the *variable* heavy chain gene. Therefore, this is not the primary process being described.\n\n*   **C) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, a cascade of plasma proteins that helps clear pathogens. It does not involve any genetic changes in B cells. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells that are proliferating within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. B cells with mutations that increase their affinity for the antigen are then preferentially selected to survive and differentiate. This process of mutation and selection is called affinity maturation. The \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in a Peyer's patch is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells within a Peyer's patch following antigen exposure is a direct description of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
