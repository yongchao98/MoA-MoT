    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dr`) and the distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:** We are told that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". In astronomical contexts, this typically refers to the number density in parallax space, or the number of stars per unit interval of parallax. Let's denote this as `dN/d(plx)`.\n    So, the given relationship is:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:** Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely related. For `plx` in arcseconds and `r` in parsecs, the formula is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Find the Relationship between Differentials:** We want to find `dN/dr`, and we know `dN/d(plx)`. We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:** We need to differentiate the parallax-distance relationship with respect to `r`:\n    `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Combine the Relationships:** Now, we substitute the known relationships into the chain rule equation. Since number counts must be positive, we are interested in the magnitude of the change, so we use the absolute value of the derivative `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    Substituting the given proportionality for `dN/d(plx)` and the derivative we just calculated:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (`r`):** The final step is to replace the parallax term (`plx`) with its equivalent in terms of distance (`r`) using the relation `plx = 1/r`.\n    `1/plx^5 = 1 / (1/r)⁵ = r⁵`\n    Now substitute this back into our proportionality for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) `\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n**Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to the cube of the distance (`r³`).\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
