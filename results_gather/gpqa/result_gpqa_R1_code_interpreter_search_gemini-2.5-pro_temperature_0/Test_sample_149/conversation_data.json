    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) - 0/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (DBE=4) plus one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a C=O or C=C bond).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity means it is coupled to two adjacent protons, suggesting a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This is consistent with the -CH2- group being adjacent to the -CHO group, confirming the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This is characteristic of an amino group (-NH2) attached to the aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal.\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (-CH2-CHO, 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, -NH2), we can assemble the structure. The two substituents on the benzene ring are the amino group (-NH2) and the acetaldehyde group (-CH2-CHO).\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 (amino group) = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\nThe starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    Structure: [Cl-][N≡N]+-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    The diazonium salt is treated with water. This is a hydrolysis reaction (Sandmeyer-type reaction) where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    The product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Structure: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is treated with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). These are the conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Aldol Addition):** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option A).\n        3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. Under these conditions, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The stability is enhanced by the extended conjugation between the benzene ring, the new C=C double bond, and the C=O double bond.\n\n    *   **Final Product Structure:**\n        The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal results in the formation of a double bond between the α-carbon (C2) and β-carbon (C3).\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol *addition* product, which is an intermediate. It is not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents (phenyl instead of hydroxyphenyl) and incorrect double bond position.\n*   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure, not a product of self-condensation.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the correct name for the final aldol *condensation* product, which is expected due to the \"Heat\" condition.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
