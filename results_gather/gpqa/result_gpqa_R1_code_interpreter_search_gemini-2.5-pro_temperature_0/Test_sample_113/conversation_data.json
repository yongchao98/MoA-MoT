    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction. The reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone (butan-2-one).\n    *   **Step 1:** The cyanide ion from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one, forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n        `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3 + CN⁻ → [CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3]`\n    *   **Step 2:** This alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final product, which is an α-hydroxy nitrile (a cyanohydrin).\n        `[CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3] + H⁺ → CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺). Looking at the options for A:\n        *   `H3O⁺`: This represents a hydronium ion, which is present in an acidic aqueous solution. It is an excellent source of protons for this protonation step.\n        *   `NaHSO3`: Sodium bisulfite is used to form bisulfite addition products with aldehydes and some ketones, which is a different reaction pathway. It is not used for cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   Therefore, reagent **A must be H3O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. The reaction involves the addition of water across the carbon-nitrogen triple bond.\n    *   Looking at the options for B, which is the catalyst used with water (H₂O):\n        *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong mineral acid. It is a standard and effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   `CH3COOH`: Acetic acid is a weak organic acid. It is generally not a strong enough catalyst to drive the hydrolysis of a stable nitrile all the way to the carboxylic acid under reasonable conditions.\n    *   Therefore, reagent **B must be HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, A is H3O⁺ and B is HCl.\n    *   This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
