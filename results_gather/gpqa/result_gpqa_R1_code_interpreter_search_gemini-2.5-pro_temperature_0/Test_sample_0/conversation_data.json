    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. The relevant form for this problem is the energy-time uncertainty principle:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of a state (also known as the natural linewidth or energy width).\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which can be taken as the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nThis principle implies that a state with a finite lifetime cannot have a perfectly defined energy. The shorter the lifetime, the larger the uncertainty or \"spread\" in its energy.\n\n**2. Defining \"Clearly Resolved\"**\n\nFor two energy levels, E₁ and E₂, to be clearly distinguished or \"resolved,\" the difference in their energies must be significantly larger than their individual energy uncertainties (widths). A common criterion is that the energy separation |E₁ - E₂| must be greater than the larger of the two energy widths, ΔE₁ or ΔE₂. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width and will therefore set the condition for resolvability.\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\nLet's calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe larger energy width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, to clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than this value.\n\n|E₁ - E₂| > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options**\n\nNow we compare this requirement with the given options:\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV  (This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV  (This is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV  (This is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly option B provides an energy separation large enough to clearly distinguish the two states, as it is several orders of magnitude greater than the natural energy width of the broader state.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Given lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate energy uncertainty (width) for each state\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (shorter lifetime): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (longer lifetime): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\n\n# The required energy difference to resolve the levels must be greater than the larger width.\nrequired_separation = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\nprint(f\"\\nTo be resolved, the energy difference must be > {required_separation:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Check the options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-9,\n    \"B\": 1e-4,\n    \"C\": 1e-11,\n    \"D\": 1e-8\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nEvaluating options:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve the problem based on the provided thinking process and code output.\n\n**1. Recap of the Reasoning:**\n*   The problem involves the energy-time uncertainty principle (ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ).\n*   A quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ = Δt) has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE).\n*   To \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than their energy widths. The most stringent condition is set by the state with the *larger* energy width.\n*   The state with the *shorter* lifetime will have the *larger* energy width.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Code Output:**\n*   The code correctly identifies the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of eV·s.\n*   It calculates the energy width (ΔE) for each state:\n    *   State 1 (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s): ΔE₁ = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   State 2 (τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s): ΔE₂ = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n*   It correctly determines that the larger width is ΔE₁ = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   The condition for resolvability is that the energy difference must be greater than this value: |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   The code then evaluates the given options against this condition:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV < 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Resolvable)\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV < 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV < 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\nThe code output confirms the initial reasoning. Only option B provides an energy difference that is significantly larger than the natural linewidth of the broader energy state, allowing the two levels to be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<B>>>"
