    "*   **Analysis of the Options:**\n    *   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory (QFT) of the strong interaction. Like other QFTs describing fundamental forces (except gravity), it suffers from ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences when calculating physical quantities using perturbation theory (e.g., via Feynman diagrams). These infinities must be handled by a process called regularization, followed by renormalization. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.\n    *   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, described by Maxwell's equations, is not a quantum theory. However, it has its own high-energy problem. If one considers a point-like charged particle (like an electron), its self-energy (the energy of its own electric field) is infinite. This is a singularity that occurs at short distances (which corresponds to high energies). To get a finite answer, one must \"regularize\" the theory, for instance, by assuming the charge is spread over a small but finite radius. So, in a sense, the classical theory also breaks down and requires a form of regularization at high energies/short distances.\n    *   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum field theory of the electromagnetic interaction. It was the first theory where the techniques of regularization and renormalization were successfully developed to tame the infinities that appear in calculations. Therefore, QED absolutely requires regularization.\n    *   **D) Superstring Theory:** This is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify all fundamental forces, including gravity. In string theory, fundamental particles are not point-like but are instead one-dimensional \"strings.\" This extended nature of the fundamental objects smooths out interactions at very short distances. A major motivation and celebrated feature of superstring theory is that it is believed to be \"UV finite,\" meaning that calculations of physical quantities do not produce the high-energy infinities that plague point-particle quantum field theories. Because it is inherently free from these divergences, it does not require the procedure of regularization.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    QCD and QED are standard examples of theories that require regularization. Classical Electrodynamics has its own high-energy pathologies requiring some form of regularization. Superstring Theory is specifically proposed as a theory that is finite at high energies and thus does not need regularization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
