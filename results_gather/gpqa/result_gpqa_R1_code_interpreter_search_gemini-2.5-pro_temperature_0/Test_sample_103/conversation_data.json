    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:**\n    The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The gravitational pull of an orbiting planet causes the star to \"wobble\" around the common center of mass (barycenter). This wobble results in a periodic change in the star's velocity along our line of sight, which is called the radial velocity ($v_r$).\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The Doppler effect for light relates the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) to the radial velocity ($v_r$) of the source:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem gives the maximum periodic shift, which corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star. This maximum velocity is the semi-amplitude of the RV signal, denoted by K.\n    Therefore, the RV amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$:\n    $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$\n\n    We are given:\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of the RV amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K can be expressed in terms of the system's physical parameters. The formula is:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    (This is a standard formula derived from Newton's law of gravitation and Kepler's Third Law, under the valid assumption that the planet's mass $m_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_{star}$).\n\n    Here:\n    *   T is the orbital period.\n    *   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight (i=90Â° for an edge-on orbit).\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Set up the Proportionality:**\n    The problem states that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have the same mass: $m_{p1} = m_{p2}$.\n\n    The problem does not specify the orbital inclinations (i). In such problems, it is a standard and necessary assumption that the unknown parameters are the same for both systems, or that we are considering the most probable/detectable case. Therefore, we assume $i_1 = i_2$, which means $\\sin i_1 = \\sin i_2$.\n\n    With these conditions, all terms in the formula for K are constant for both systems, except for K and the orbital period T. This leads to the following proportionality:\n    $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    We can write the relationship for the two systems as a ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We already found that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4$. Substituting this value:\n    $1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    To solve for the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$, we first cube both sides:\n    $1.4^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n    $2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n\n    Finally, we invert the expression to find the desired ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Now, we perform the final calculation.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the RV amplitudes\nK_ratio = 7 / 5\n\n# The relationship between the RV amplitude ratio and the period ratio is K_ratio = (T_ratio)^(-1/3)\n# We want to find T_ratio = T2 / T1\n# K2/K1 = (T1/T2)^(1/3)\n# (K2/K1)^3 = T1/T2\n# T2/T1 = 1 / (K2/K1)^3\n\nT_ratio = 1 / (K_ratio**3)\nprint(T_ratio)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.3644314868878369\n</execute_output>\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculation are as follows:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The radial velocity (RV) amplitude, K, is directly proportional to the observed periodic wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$.\n    *   $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n    *   For planet #1, $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom.\n    *   The ratio of the RV amplitudes is $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T):** The formula for the RV amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    where T is the orbital period, $m_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, and i is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Establish Proportionality:** The problem states that the star masses are the same ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planet masses are the same ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$). We also assume the orbital inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$), as is standard when this information is not provided. With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a proportionality between K and T:\n    *   $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:** We can express the relationship for the two systems as a ratio:\n    *   $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    *   $\\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n    *   $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the value of the RV amplitude ratio we found in step 1:\n    *   $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{(1.4)^3} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>"
