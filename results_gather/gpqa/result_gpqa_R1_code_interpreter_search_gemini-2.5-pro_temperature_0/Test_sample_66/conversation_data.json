    "An electron in a p orbital has an orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$. The possible values for the magnetic quantum number $m_l$ are -1, 0, and +1. The eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is $m_l \\hbar$.\n\nThe problem considers a system of two such electrons.\n*   Electron 1: $l_1 = 1$, with possible $m_{l1} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   Electron 2: $l_2 = 1$, with possible $m_{l2} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\nThe system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\nHere, $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $m=-1$ is the total magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta.\nThis is expressed by the selection rule:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nThe state $|l, m>$ can be written as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$ (which is a shorthand for $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>$):\n$|l, m> = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} <l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m> |m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$\nThe coefficients $<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>$ are known as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. These coefficients are non-zero only if the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is satisfied.\n\nIn this problem, the initial state is $|l=2, m=-1>$. This means the system has a definite total magnetic quantum number $m=-1$. Any measurement of the individual components $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$ must yield values that sum to -1.\nThe possible combinations of $(m_{l1}, m_{l2})$ that can be found upon measurement are:\n*   $(m_{l1}=0, m_{l2}=-1)$\n*   $(m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=0)$\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the system in the state where $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$.\n\nLet's check if this outcome is possible. For this outcome, the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers would be:\n$m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\nHowever, the initial state has a total magnetic quantum number of $m=-1$. Since $-2 \\neq -1$, this outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\nThe probability of measuring the outcome $(m_{l1}, m_{l2})$ is given by the square of the absolute value of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n$P(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = |<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>|^2$\n\nWe want to find the probability for $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$:\n$P(-1, -1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2$\n\nBecause the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is not satisfied (i.e., $-1 \\neq -1 + (-1)$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$ is zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n$P(-1, -1) = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nIt is impossible to measure $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$ when the system is in the state $|l=2, m=-1>$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
