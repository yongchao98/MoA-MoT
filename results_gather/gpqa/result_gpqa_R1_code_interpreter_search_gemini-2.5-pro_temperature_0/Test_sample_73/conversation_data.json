    "This is a problem about the probability of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of decay in a future time interval does not depend on how long the atom has already survived.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Model the Decay:**\n    The probability that an atom has *not* decayed by time *t* (the survival probability) is given by the formula:\n    P(T > t) = e^(-λt)\n    where T is the time of decay and λ is the decay constant.\n\n    The probability that the atom *has* decayed by time *t* is:\n    P(T ≤ t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n2.  **Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32\n    This means the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes is:\n    P(T > 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n    Using the survival formula:\n    e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n    We don't need to solve for λ explicitly. We can use the expression `e^(-100λ) = 0.68` in our next steps.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Question:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    In mathematical terms, we want to find:\n    P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)\n\n4.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    For an exponential process, the probability of an event happening in a future interval is independent of how long we have already waited. The clock essentially \"resets\".\n    Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes, is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying in the first 150 minutes.\n    P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    We need to calculate P(T ≤ 150), which is `1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    We can rewrite `e^(-150λ)` using the value we found in step 2:\n    e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n    Since `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`, we have:\n    e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n    Now, we can calculate the final probability:\n    Probability = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We know that the probability of survival for 100 minutes is 0.68.\n# The probability of decay in a 150-minute interval is 1 - (survival_prob_100_min)^(150/100)\n# This is 1 - (0.68)^1.5\nprob = 1 - (0.68)**1.5\nprint(f\"{prob:.4f}\")\n```\n```output\n0.4393\n```\nThe calculated probability is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The decay of a single atom is a random process. The probability of decay per unit time is constant. This leads to an exponential decay law. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The atom does not \"age.\"\n\n2.  **Define the Survival Probability:** Let P(t) be the probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time *t*. This is also called the survival probability. The formula for this is:\n    P(t) = e^(-λt)\n    where λ is the decay constant.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   Probability of decay by t=100 is 1 - P(100) = 0.32.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of survival at t=100 is P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n    *   Using the formula from step 2: e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Question Mathematically:**\n    We are asked for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, *given* that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   This is a conditional probability: P(decay between t=50 and t=200 | survived until t=50).\n    *   In mathematical notation: P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50), where T is the time of decay.\n\n5.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    Because the process is memoryless, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. The clock effectively \"resets.\"\n    *   Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand-new atom decaying in the *first* 150 minutes.\n    *   So, we just need to calculate the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval: P(decay by t=150).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    *   The probability of decay by t=150 is 1 - P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n    *   We can find the value of e^(-λ * 150) using the information from step 3 (e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68).\n    *   Rewrite the exponent: e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n    *   Substitute the known value: (0.68)^1.5\n    *   The probability of decay is therefore: 1 - (0.68)^1.5.\n\n7.  **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    The python script calculated this value:\n    `1 - (0.68)**1.5 = 0.4393`\n    This probability is 0.4393, or 43.93%.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    Rounding 43.93% to the nearest whole number gives 44%. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
