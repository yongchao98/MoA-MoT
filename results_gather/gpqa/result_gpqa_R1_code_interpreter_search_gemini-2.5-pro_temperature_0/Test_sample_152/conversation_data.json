    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The reactant is dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂.\n    *   The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), is strong enough to deprotonate the α-carbon, which is acidic due to the two adjacent electron-withdrawing ester groups.\n    *   CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt ⇌ [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂]Na⁺ + EtOH\n    *   The nucleophile is the malonate enolate, [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂].\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):**\n    *   The reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   The structure is p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃.\n    *   The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Reaction and Product Structure:**\n    *   The nucleophilic malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a 1,4-conjugate addition (Michael addition).\n    *   The double bond shifts, and the resulting negative charge on the α-carbon is stabilized by the ester group, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    *   [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂] + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃ → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -⁻CH-COOCH₃\n    *   This enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n    *   p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -⁻CH-COOCH₃ + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻\n    *   The final product structure is: (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):**\n    *   We can name this compound as a substituted propane with three methyl carboxylate groups.\n    *   The carbon backbone connecting the functional groups is C-C-C. Let's number it C1-C2-C3.\n    *   Let C1 be the carbon from the malonate: CH(COOCH₃)₂.\n    *   Let C2 be the β-carbon from the acrylate: CH(p-tolyl).\n    *   Let C3 be the α-carbon from the acrylate: CH₂. The third carboxylate group is attached to C3.\n    *   The structure is a propane chain with two carboxylate groups at C1, a p-tolyl group at C2, and one carboxylate group at C3.\n    *   The IUPAC-based name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The reactant 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral but strongly nucleophilic at the α-carbon (the β-carbon of the original enone system).\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):**\n    *   The reactant (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN.\n    *   The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n3.  **Determine the Reaction and Product Structure:**\n    *   This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which proceeds via a Michael-type addition.\n    *   The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms an iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   The carbanion is protonated (likely by the methanol solvent).\n    *   The key step is the final workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The acid hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone) and protonated piperidine.\n    *   The net result is the formation of a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone) and the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the 2-position with the fragment from butenenitrile.\n    *   The added fragment is -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   The final product structure is 2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (B):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The parent chain is a butanenitrile: CH₃-CH-CH₂-CN. Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon (C1).\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The substituent name is (2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Therefore, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, more stable tautomer.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the Michael donor, reactant C.\n    *   The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK): CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of the acceptor. For MVK, the β-carbon is the terminal CH₂. After addition and protonation of the intermediate enolate, the MVK fragment becomes -CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃, which is a (3-oxobutyl) group.\n    *   The product shows this (3-oxobutyl) group attached to position 2 of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring.\n    *   This means the new C-C bond was formed between C2 of the dione and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione, formed by deprotonating the highly acidic C-H bond at position 2 (between the two carbonyls).\n\n2.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   The nucleophile is the enolate of reactant C. Based on the retrosynthesis, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates cyclohexane-1,3-dione at C2 to form the nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks MVK to give the observed product after workup.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n*   B) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect A and B)\n*   C) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (**Correct**)\n*   D) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect A, B, and C)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
