    "An arbitrary density matrix $\\rho$ for a single qubit can be represented as a point in the Bloch sphere. The relationship between the density matrix and the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ is given by the formula:\n\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nwhere $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix and $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices. The vector $\\vec{r}$ represents the geometrical position of the qubit state in the Bloch sphere.\n\nThe components of the Bloch vector can be calculated using the formula:\n$r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$, where $k \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n\nLet's first write the given density matrix in its matrix form. The basis states are:\n$|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe outer products are:\n$|0\\rangle\\langle 0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$|1\\rangle\\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe given density matrix is:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n\nThis is the density matrix for a maximally mixed state.\n\nNow, let's find the corresponding Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\n\n**Method 1: Direct comparison**\n\nWe set the general form equal to our specific density matrix:\n$\\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x \\sigma_x + r_y \\sigma_y + r_z \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n$I + r_x \\sigma_x + r_y \\sigma_y + r_z \\sigma_z = I$\n\nSubtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n$r_x \\sigma_x + r_y \\sigma_y + r_z \\sigma_z = 0$\n\nThe Pauli matrices are linearly independent, so for this equation to hold, the coefficients must all be zero:\n$r_x = 0$\n$r_y = 0$\n$r_z = 0$\n\nThus, the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**Method 2: Using the trace formula**\n\nThe Pauli matrices are:\n$\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe calculate each component of $\\vec{r}$:\n$r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$.\n\n$r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$.\n\n$r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(1-1) = 0$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This point corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\nTherefore, the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space is r=(0,0,0).\n\n<<<C>>>"
