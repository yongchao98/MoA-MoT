    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Physics Principles:** The problem involves two inertial reference frames moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light (relativistic speed). This indicates that the principles of Special Relativity must be applied. The key concepts are time dilation and the definition of distance in different reference frames.\n\n2.  **Define the Reference Frames:**\n    *   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled by the ejecta.\n    *   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time given (50 seconds) is measured in this frame.\n\n3.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (proper time), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `Δx`.\n\n5.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   The distance `Δx` in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula `Δx = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   We are given the time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`), not the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n    *   Due to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) compared to the time interval measured in the moving ejecta's frame (`Δt'`).\n    *   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n6.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio `v/c`.**\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`.**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame, `Δx`.**\n        `Δx = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n\n7.  **Execute the Calculation using a Python script for precision.**\n    The script will combine the steps above to get a precise numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\nc = 300000  # km/s, approximate value is sufficient for this problem\ndt_prime = 50  # seconds in the ejecta's frame (proper time)\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (time dilation)\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\ndx = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"{dx=}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\ndx=3061862.178478728\n</execute_code>\n\n8.  **Analyze the Result and Choose the Answer:**\n    *   The calculated distance is `Δx ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n    *   Let's compare this to the given options:\n        A) 2,940,000 km\n        B) 2,880,000 km\n        C) 3,000,000 km\n        D) 3,060,000 km\n    *   The calculated value is extremely close to option D.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Identify the Physics**\n\nThe problem describes a scenario where an object (supernova ejecta) is moving at a very high speed relative to an observer (in the Galaxy's reference frame). The speed, 60,000 km/s, is 20% of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s). When speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, the effects of Special Relativity become important. The key concept here is **time dilation**.\n\n**2. Define the Reference Frames**\n\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference from which we want to measure the distance.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. The time given, 50 seconds, is measured in this frame. This is known as the **proper time** (`Δt'`) because it's the time measured by a clock that is at rest in its own frame.\n\n**3. State the Goal**\n\nWe need to find the distance (`Δx`) the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`.\n`Δx = v * Δt`\nHere, `v` is the velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, and `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**4. Apply the Time Dilation Formula**\n\nWe are given the time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt' = 50 s`), but we need the time in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`). According to the principle of time dilation, a moving clock runs slower as observed from a stationary frame. The relationship is:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    *   Velocity `v = 60,000 km/s`\n    *   Speed of light `c = 300,000 km/s`\n    *   The ratio `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n    *   `γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    *   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    *   This means that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame measures about 51.03 seconds.\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (Δx).**\n    *   `Δx = v * Δt`\n    *   `Δx = 60,000 km/s * (γ * 50 s)`\n    *   `Δx = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    *   `Δx = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n    *   Using the calculated value from the code execution: `Δx ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**6. Compare with Options and Conclude**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. Let's look at the options:\nA) 2,940,000 km\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect, non-relativistic answer: 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\nD) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value `3,061,862 km` is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
