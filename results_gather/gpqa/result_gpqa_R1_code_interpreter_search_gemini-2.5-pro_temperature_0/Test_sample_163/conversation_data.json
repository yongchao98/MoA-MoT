    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2. This can be written as `M_total_1 / M_total_2`.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial velocity amplitudes (K1_1, K1_2) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial velocity amplitudes (K2_1, K2_2) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n    *   **Crucial Detail:** Both systems are \"eclipsing\". This implies that we are viewing the orbits edge-on, so the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees, and `sin(i)` is approximately 1.\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = M1 + M2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K1, K2) by the following formula:\n    `M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))`\n    where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio `M_total_1 / M_total_2`.\n    `M_total_1 = (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i_1))`\n    `M_total_2 = (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i_2))`\n\n    When we take the ratio, the constant term `(2 * π * G)` cancels out. Since both are eclipsing systems, we assume `sin^3(i_1) ≈ sin^3(i_2) ≈ 1`, so this term also cancels. The formula for the ratio simplifies to:\n    `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Sum of Velocities for Each System:**\n    *   For system_1: `K_total_1 = K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   For system_2: `K_total_2 = K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Values into the Ratio Formula:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K_total_1 = 15 km/s\n    *   K_total_2 = 25 km/s\n\n    `Ratio = (2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3)`\n    `Ratio = 2 * (15/25)^3`\n    `Ratio = 2 * (3/5)^3`\n    `Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `Ratio = 54 / 125`\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    `Ratio = 0.432`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of 0.432 is closest to the option D) ~ 0.4.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I will use a Python script to perform the calculation.\n```python\n# Parameters for system_1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_1 = 10.0  # km/s\nK1_2 = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Parameters for system_2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2_1 = 15.0  # km/s\nK2_2 = 10.0  # km/s\n\n# The total mass of a binary system is proportional to P * (K1 + K2)^3\n# where P is the period and K1, K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\n# Calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_total_1 = K1_1 + K1_2\nK_total_2 = K2_1 + K2_2\n\n# Calculate the proportionality term for each system's mass\nmass_prop_1 = P1 * (K_total_1)**3\nmass_prop_2 = P2 * (K_total_2)**3\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2\nmass_ratio = mass_prop_1 / mass_prop_2\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```",
    "The calculation confirms that the ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is 0.432.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n1.  The total mass of a spectroscopic binary system is given by the mass function: `M1 + M2 = (P / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))) * (K1 + K2)^3`.\n2.  Since we are asked for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (`M_total_1`) to system_2 (`M_total_2`), the constant term `(1 / (2 * π * G))` cancels out.\n3.  The problem states that both systems are eclipsing, which means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees. Therefore, `sin(i)` is approximately 1, and `sin^3(i)` is also 1 for both systems. This term also cancels out.\n4.  The ratio simplifies to `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3)`.\n5.  Plugging in the given values:\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n6.  The ratio is `(2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3) = 2 * (15/25)^3 = 2 * (3/5)^3 = 2 * (27/125) = 54/125 = 0.432`.\n7.  This value is approximately 0.4.\n\nComparing the result with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 0.4\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
