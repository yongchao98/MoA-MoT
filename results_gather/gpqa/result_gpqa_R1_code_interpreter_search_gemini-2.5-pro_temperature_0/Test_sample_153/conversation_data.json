    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak. This M⁺ to M⁺+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a definitive indicator of the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic, unmistakable signal for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration for one proton (1H) and its singlet (s) nature confirm this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent, leading to this simplified splitting pattern. The protons at 8.02 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the protons at 7.72 ppm are ortho to the chlorine atom.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group attached to a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n### 4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound is a **chlorinated benzoic acid** with a **para substitution pattern**. Let's check the proposed structures:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, and the NMR substitution pattern would be different (1,2,3-trisubstituted).\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **This structure fits all the data perfectly.**\n    *   **Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂\n    *   **MW:** 156.5 g/mol (matches MS).\n    *   **Functional Group:** Contains a carboxylic acid (matches IR and NMR).\n    *   **Substitution:** It is a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring (matches NMR splitting pattern).\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. This is an ortho-substituted ring, which would result in a more complex NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR and the acidic proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the NMR.\n\nThe evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
