    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its initial rest-mass energy is `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   The fragments are moving, so they have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`, and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n    *   The total energy of the final state is `E_final = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`.\n    *   The total momentum of the final state is `P_final = p1 + p2`.\n\n**2. Use the Given Information to Find Rest Masses and Total Kinetic Energy**\n\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2` (Let `m1` be the more massive fragment).\n\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass `M`:\n    `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\n*   Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\n*   We can now find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n    *   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n    *   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n*   The total kinetic energy released in the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy. This comes from the conservation of total energy:\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `M * c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n    `T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n    `T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n    So, the total kinetic energy of the fragments is `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   The initial momentum was zero, so the final total momentum must also be zero:\n    `P_initial = P_final = 0`\n    `p1 + p2 = 0`\n*   This means the fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), we have:\n    `p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical`\n    `p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n*   Therefore:\n    `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33 * M) / (0.66 * M) = 1/2`\n    `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n*   Now use the total kinetic energy equation:\n    `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the Correct Relativistic Formula**\n\n*   The relativistic relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   We also know that total energy is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Substituting this into the energy-momentum relation gives:\n    `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n    `T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2 + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n    `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`\n*   Since the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), their squares are also equal:\n    `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`  => `T2 = 3 - T1`\n    2.  `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(99)`\n*   Substitute (1) into (2):\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*99`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Now, solve for `T1`:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\n*   Correct (relativistic) value: `T1_rel = 1.005 GeV`\n*   Classical approximation: `T1_classical = 1.000 GeV`\n*   Difference = `T1_rel - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\n*   Convert the difference to Mega-electron Volts (MeV):\n    `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe following code confirms the calculation.\n```python\n# Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\nE0 = 300\n\n# Rest-mass energies of the fragments in GeV\n# m1 = 2 * m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# This leads to m1 = 0.66 * M and m2 = 0.33 * M\nm1c2 = 0.66 * E0\nm2c2 = 0.33 * E0\n\n# Total kinetic energy released (Q-value) in GeV\nQ = E0 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation ---\n# From conservation of momentum (p^2 = 2*m*T), we get m1*T1 = m2*T2\n# T2_cl = (m1/m2) * T1_cl = 2 * T1_cl\n# T1_cl + T2_cl = Q  => T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation ---\n# From conservation of momentum ((pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*mc^2), we get:\n# T1_rel^2 + 2*T1_rel*m1c2 = T2_rel^2 + 2*T2_rel*m2c2\n# We also know T2_rel = Q - T1_rel.\n# Substituting and solving the resulting linear equation for T1_rel:\n# T1_rel * (2*m1c2 + 2*m2c2 + 2*Q) = Q**2 + 2*Q*m2c2\nT1_relativistic = (Q**2 + 2*Q*m2c2) / (2*m1c2 + 2*m2c2 + 2*Q)\n\n# Difference in MeV\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"The difference is {difference_MeV} MeV.\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
