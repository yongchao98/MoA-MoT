    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L` is `S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J` is `0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   The Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1`, meaning `L+S+T` must be an odd integer.\n    *   For the initial state, `L_i=0` and `S_i=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd. This implies the initial isospin `T_i` must be odd. The simplest case is `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and the Emitted Particle\nThe reaction is `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n*   The final two-nucleon state `NN_f` has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n*   The emitted particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n*   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum `l_X` of the particle `X` relative to the final `NN_f` system.\n    *   `s` => `l_X = 0`\n    *   `p` => `l_X = 1`\n    *   `f` => `l_X = 3`\n*   We assume the particle X is a meson (like a pion), which has spin `s_X = 0`.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws and Fundamental Principles\n\nWe need to check each proposed reaction against the following rules:\n\n**Rule 1: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that Pauli statistics require `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nWe are given that the final state has `T_f = 0`.\nSubstituting this into the rule:\n`0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis equation holds true only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number. This, in turn, means that the sum of the final spin and orbital angular momentum, `S_f + L_f`, must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Rule 2: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum must be conserved.\n`J_i = J_f + j_X` (vector sum).\nSince we assume `s_X=0`, the total angular momentum of particle X is `j_X = l_X`.\nThe initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\nSo, `0 = J_f + l_X` (vector sum). This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal, i.e., `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**Rule 3: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity must be conserved.\n`P_i = P_f`\nThe initial parity is `P_i = +1`.\nThe final parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the final particles and the parity of their relative orbital motion: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`\n*   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n*   Parity of relative motion is `(-1)^l_X`\nSo, the equation for parity conservation is:\n`+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n`+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`\nThis simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Rule 4: Validity of the NN State**\nA two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state with a different total spin is not a valid two-nucleon state.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's create a table to check each option against these four rules.\n\n| Option | Final NN State (`(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`) | `l_X` | Rule 1: `S_f+L_f` odd? | Rule 2: `J_f=l_X`? | Rule 3: `L_f+l_X` odd? | Rule 4: `S_f`=0 or 1? | Permitted? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **A)** | `3P0` (`S_f=1, L_f=1, J_f=0`) | 0 | `1+1=2` (even) -> **No** | `0=0` -> Yes | `1+0=1` (odd) -> Yes | `S_f=1` -> Yes | **No** |\n| **B)** | `3S1` (`S_f=1, L_f=0, J_f=1`) | 1 | `1+0=1` (odd) -> Yes | `1=1` -> Yes | `0+1=1` (odd) -> Yes | `S_f=1` -> Yes | Yes |\n| **C)** | `7D1` (`S_f=3, L_f=2, J_f=1`) | 1 | `3+2=5` (odd) -> Yes | `1=1` -> Yes | `2+1=3` (odd) -> Yes | `S_f=3` -> **No** | **No** |\n| **D)** | `3D3` (`S_f=1, L_f=2, J_f=3`) | 3 | `1+2=3` (odd) -> Yes | `3=3` -> Yes | `2+3=5` (odd) -> Yes | `S_f=1` -> Yes | Yes |\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom the analysis, we find two forbidden transitions:\n*   **A) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`:** This transition is forbidden because it violates the Pauli principle for the final state (Rule 1). The sum `S_f + L_f = 2` is even, but for a `T_f=0` state, it must be odd.\n*   **C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`:** This transition is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is not a valid state for a two-nucleon system (Rule 4). A `7D1` state would require a total spin `S_f=3`, which is impossible for two spin-1/2 particles.\n\nSince the question asks for a single answer and explicitly provides the Pauli statistics condition (`T = S + L + 1 (mod 2)`), it is most likely that the intended answer is the one that violates this specific rule. Option A is the only one that violates this rule. The state in option C is invalid for a more fundamental reason related to the system's composition, but it coincidentally satisfies the given Pauli rule and the conservation laws. Therefore, the violation highlighted by the problem statement points to A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
