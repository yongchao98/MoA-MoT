    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n**1. Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nIn a conservative system, the total energy is constant. For a relativistic particle moving in a potential, the total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy $U(x)$.\n\nThe relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy associated with this force is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\nTherefore, the total conserved energy of the system is:\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n**2. Analyze the Energy at Key Points of the Oscillation**\n\nWe can evaluate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillator's motion:\n*   At the point of maximum amplitude (the turning point).\n*   At the equilibrium position (the center of oscillation).\n\nSince the total energy is conserved, the value of $E_{total}$ must be the same at both points.\n\n**a) At Maximum Amplitude (x = A)**\n\nAt the maximum amplitude $x=A$, the mass momentarily comes to a stop before changing direction.\n*   Position: $x = A$\n*   Speed: $v = 0$\n*   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$\n\nThe total energy at this point is:\n$E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n**b) At the Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**\n\nAt the equilibrium position $x=0$, the potential energy is zero, and the mass reaches its maximum speed, $v_{max}$.\n*   Position: $x = 0$\n*   Speed: $v = v_{max}$\n*   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nThe total energy at this point is:\n$E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n**3. Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max**\n\nBy the principle of energy conservation, the total energy at both points must be equal:\n$\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$. First, let's isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2}$\n$\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nNext, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nTo solve for $v_{max}$, we can perform the following algebraic steps:\n1.  Invert both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n2.  Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n3.  Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n4.  Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n    $v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} \\right)$\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n**Alternative Method: Relativistic Work-Energy Theorem**\n\nThe work done by the spring force in moving the mass from $x=A$ to $x=0$ is equal to the change in its relativistic kinetic energy, $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\n\n*   Work done: $W = \\int_A^0 F dx = \\int_A^0 (-kx) dx = [-\\frac{1}{2}kx^2]_A^0 = 0 - (-\\frac{1}{2}kA^2) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n*   Change in kinetic energy: $\\Delta K = K_{final} - K_{initial}$.\n    *   $K_{initial}$ (at $x=A$, $v=0$): $K_{initial} = (\\gamma(0) - 1)mc^2 = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\n    *   $K_{final}$ (at $x=0$, $v=v_{max}$): $K_{final} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n    *   $\\Delta K = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\nEquating work and change in kinetic energy:\n$\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n$\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nThis gives the same expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ and thus leads to the same final answer for $v_{max}$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
