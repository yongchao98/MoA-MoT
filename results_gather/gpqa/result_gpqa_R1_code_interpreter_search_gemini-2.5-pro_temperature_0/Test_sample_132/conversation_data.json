    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution containing dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4^-) and hydrogen phosphate (HPO4^2-).\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System**\n*   The solution contains KH2PO4, which dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4-.\n*   The solution also contains Na2HPO4●2H2O, which dissociates completely into 2Na+, HPO4^2-, and 2H2O.\n*   Therefore, we have a buffer system consisting of the weak acid H2PO4- and its conjugate base HPO4^2-.\n*   The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Equilibria**\nThe phosphate system involves three dissociation steps for phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\n*   H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4-  (Ka1 = 7.5 x 10^-3)\n*   H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8)\n*   HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-  (Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12)\n\nThe primary equilibrium that determines the pH of our buffer is the second one (Ka2), as we have significant amounts of both H2PO4- and HPO4^2-. The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is determined by the third equilibrium (Ka3).\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the moles of the buffer components.**\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Since KH2PO4 provides H2PO4- and Na2HPO4●2H2O provides HPO4^2-, we have:\n        *   Moles of H2PO4- = 0.007348 mol\n        *   Moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005618 mol\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L\n    *   [H2PO4-] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium.**\n    *   The equilibrium expression for the second dissociation is: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]: [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    *   [H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * 1.308\n    *   [H+] = 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n\n*   **Step D: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium.**\n    *   The equilibrium expression for the third dissociation is: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   We rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]: [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n    *   We assume that the concentration of HPO4^2- at equilibrium is approximately its initial concentration (0.02809 M) because Ka3 is very small, meaning very little HPO4^2- will dissociate.\n    *   [PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10^-8 M)\n    *   [PO4^3-] = 6.235 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis result is closest to 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can perform the calculation with a script.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\n\nka2 = 6.2e-8\nka3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of each component\nmoles_kh2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4  # This gives moles of H2PO4-\nmoles_na2hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o  # This gives moles of HPO4^2-\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_h2po4 = moles_kh2po4 / volume_L\nconc_hpo4 = moles_na2hpo4 / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_h_plus = ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate concentration [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n# We assume [HPO4^2-] at equilibrium is approximately its initial concentration.\nconc_po4 = ka3 * (conc_hpo4 / conc_h_plus)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{conc_po4:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each substance.**\n    *   The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O.\n    *   KH2PO4 provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-).\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = Mass of KH2PO4 / Molar mass of KH2PO4\n        *   Moles H2PO4- = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O / Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O\n        *   Moles HPO4^2- = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   Concentration of H2PO4- ([H2PO4-]) = Moles / Volume\n        *   [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Concentration of HPO4^2- ([HPO4^2-]) = Moles / Volume\n        *   [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer.**\n    *   The solution is a buffer made of the weak acid H2PO4- and its conjugate base HPO4^2-. The equilibrium governing the pH is:\n        *   H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n    *   The expression for Ka2 is: Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n        *   [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n        *   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4³⁻] concentration.**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion:\n        *   HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n    *   The expression for Ka3 is: Ka3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for the orthophosphate concentration [PO4³⁻]:\n        *   [PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   We use the concentrations we have already determined. Since Ka3 is very small, the equilibrium concentration of HPO4²⁻ is essentially its initial concentration (0.02809 M).\n        *   [PO4³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n        *   [PO4³⁻] ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M, which matches option B. The Python code executed in the previous step confirmed this calculation, yielding an output of `6.24e-07`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
