    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n    The general solutions for the scalar potential V and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ in electrodynamics, under the Lorenz gauge condition, are given by the retarded potential formulas. These formulas account for the finite speed of light, `c`, meaning the fields at a point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ depend on the state of the sources at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$.\n\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n    Here, $\\rho$ is the charge density, $\\vec{J}$ is the current density, $\\vec{r}'$ is the position vector of a point within the source distribution, and $t_r$ is the retarded time, defined by the relation:\n    $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n    This equation signifies that the signal (field) emitted from $\\vec{r}'$ at time $t_r$ travels a distance $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|$ and arrives at the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at the present time $t$.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals**\n    Substituting these densities into the potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n    The key difficulty in evaluating these integrals is that the retarded time $t_r$ inside the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation (often shown in advanced E&M textbooks) involves a change of variables and accounts for the \"compression\" of the apparent volume of the source due to its motion.\n\n    The result of this integration yields a correction factor in the denominator. Let's define the quantities as given in the problem:\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: Position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$: Velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n\n    The retarded time condition becomes $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n    The result of the integration is:\n    $\\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\frac{1}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} = \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n    The term $(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})$ accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect. If the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the denominator decreases, leading to a stronger potential, and vice-versa.\n\n4.  **Final Expressions for V and A**\n    Substituting this result back into the integral expressions for V and A:\n\n    For the scalar potential V:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right)$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    For the vector potential A:\n    The velocity $\\vec{v}(t_r)$ is constant with respect to the spatial integration over $\\vec{r}'$, so it can be taken out of the integral.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\left( \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right)$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparison with Options**\n    Let's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        This is incorrect. V is the static potential, which doesn't account for retardation. The expression for A is dimensionally wrong.\n\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This has the wrong sign in the denominator, which is physically incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        Again, V is the incorrect static potential. Although the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials (since $\\vec{A}/V = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v} = \\vec{v}/c^2$), the expression for V itself is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>"
