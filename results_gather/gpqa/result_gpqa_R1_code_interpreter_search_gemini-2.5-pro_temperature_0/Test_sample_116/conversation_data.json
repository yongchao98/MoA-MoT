    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are:\n    1.  **Chiral Center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n    2.  **Axial Chirality:** Chirality arising from a molecule that has an axis of chirality, such as in allenes, spiranes, or atropisomers (e.g., substituted biphenyls).\n    3.  **Planar Chirality:** Chirality arising from a molecule that has a plane of chirality.\n\n    A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it possesses an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n*   **Step-by-step analysis of each compound:**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system, which consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond.\n        *   **Substituents:** There are bulky substituents at all four ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). Specifically, a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3) is at the 2 and 2' positions, and a nitro group (-NO2) is at the 6 and 6' positions.\n        *   **Chirality:** The steric hindrance caused by these four bulky ortho groups prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar (twisted relative to each other). This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**.\n        *   **Symmetry Check:** In this twisted conformation, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The arrangement of substituents is asymmetric. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is an ester derived from lactic acid.\n        *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the α-carbon). This carbon is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n        *   **Symmetry Check:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    3.  **benzophenone**\n        *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2C=O. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n        *   **Chirality:** The central carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl groups). It is not a chiral center.\n        *   **Symmetry Check:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two methoxycarbonyl groups in a *trans* configuration across the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar due to the sp2 hybridization of the carbons in the double bond.\n        *   **Symmetry Check:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not. Therefore, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
