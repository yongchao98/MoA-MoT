    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which can be written as T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula is:\n    T_eq = [L * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * a²)]^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   L is the star's luminosity.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Determine the Relationship between Temperature and Orbital Distance:** Since Planet_4 and Planet_2 orbit the same star, L is constant. The problem states they have the same albedo (A). The values π and σ are also constants. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to (1/a²)^(1/4), which simplifies to:\n    T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2) or T_eq ∝ 1/√a\n\n4.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:** Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures as:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a₄)^(-1/2) / (a₂)^(-1/2) = (a₂ / a₄)^(1/2)\n\n5.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** We need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a₂ / a₄). Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n    T² ∝ a³\n    This can be rearranged to express 'a' in terms of 'T':\n    a ∝ T^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Formulate the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** Using the relationship from Kepler's Third Law, the ratio of the semi-major axes can be written in terms of their orbital periods:\n    a₂ / a₄ = (T₂ / T₄)^(2/3)\n\n7.  **Combine the Equations:** Now, substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio (from step 6) into the temperature ratio equation (from step 4):\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (T₂ / T₄)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n    By applying the power rule for exponents ((x^m)^n = x^(m*n)), we get:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T₂ / T₄)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T₂ / T₄)^(1/3)\n\n8.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods for the five planets as T₁:T₂:T₃:T₄:T₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we can find the specific ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    T₂ / T₄ = 2 / 3.5\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Substitute the period ratio into the final equation from step 7 and perform the calculation.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is given by (T_period_2 / T_period_4)^(1/3).\n# The ratio of the orbital periods T2:T4 is 2:3.5.\n\n# Define the ratio of the periods\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.8298640650313316\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.83. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.83\nB) ~0.69\nC) ~0.57\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its semi-major axis (a) by the formula:\nT_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a₄)^(-1/2) / (a₂)^(-1/2) = (a₂ / a₄)^(1/2)\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a):\nP² ∝ a³  or  a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nSo, the ratio of the semi-major axes can be expressed in terms of the orbital periods:\na₂ / a₄ = (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)\n\nNow, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)^((2/3) * (1/2))\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of the orbital periods as P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nFrom this, we get the ratio P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5.\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>"
