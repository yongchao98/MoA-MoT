    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is the same in all directions, which is evident from its dependence only on the radial distance $r$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The Hamiltonian for this system can be separated in Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$) since $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. The total Hamiltonian is the sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n    where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 x_i^2$ for $i=x, y, z$.\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\n    The total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy Levels and States:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy state, which corresponds to the smallest possible value of $n$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z$ must be non-negative integers, the minimum value for their sum is $n=0$. This occurs only for the state $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n        *   Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to the next energy level, $n=1$.\n        *   Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        *   Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n        *   Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:** The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that correspond to that energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n\n    Let's list the possible combinations $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n    *   One number is 3, the others are 0: (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3). This gives 3 states.\n    *   One number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2). This gives 6 states.\n    *   All numbers are 1: (1, 1, 1). This gives 1 state.\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the general formula for the degeneracy of the $n$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, which is a standard result from combinatorics (stars and bars problem):\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n + D - 1)!}{n!(D - 1)!}$, where $D$ is the number of dimensions.\n    For our case, $D=3$, so the formula becomes:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n + 3 - 1)!}{n!(3 - 1)!} = \\frac{(n+2)!}{n!2!} = \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}$\n\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The energy of the third excited state ($n=3$) is $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy (the degeneracy) is 10.\n\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3 - Incorrect degeneracy.\n    B) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10 - Correct energy and degeneracy.\n    C) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3 - Incorrect energy formula and degeneracy.\n    D) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10 - Incorrect energy formula.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
