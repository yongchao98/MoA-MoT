    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness of the peak is characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid, which participates in strong hydrogen bonding, causing the peak to broaden.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is consistent with the carbonyl group of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them. We must use the NMR data to distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described. Let's analyze what these patterns mean:\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** A proton that shows this splitting pattern must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1, splits into n+1=2 lines).\n    *   A group of two adjacent protons (giving the **t**riplet, n=2, splits into n+1=3 lines).\n    *   A group of three adjacent protons (giving the **q**uartet, n=3, splits into n+1=4 lines).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** A proton that shows this splitting pattern must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1, splits into n+1=2 lines).\n    *   A group of two adjacent protons (giving the first **t**riplet, n=2, splits into n+1=3 lines).\n    *   Another, different group of two adjacent protons (giving the second **t**riplet, n=2, splits into n+1=3 lines).\n\nNow, let's examine the structure of each option to see if its protons would produce these specific splitting patterns. We will focus on the methine (CH) protons, as they are the most likely to have multiple, distinct neighbors.\n\n---\n\n#### **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n\nLet's label the key protons: `CH₃-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(Et)-CH(d)(Et)-COOH`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(d) (1H, doublet), the CH₂(b) group (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt** pattern. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(d):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This gives a **dt** pattern.\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to the CH₃ group (3H, quartet) and H(c) (1H, doublet). This gives a **qd** (quartet of doublets).\n*   **Conclusion for A:** This structure has a `dtt` signal but does not have a `dtq` signal. So, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n#### **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n\nLet's label the key protons: `CH₃(a)-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH₂(d)-COOH`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(b) (1H, doublet), the CH₂(d) group (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets) pattern. **This matches one of the required signals.**\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet), the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet), and the CH₃(a) group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets) pattern. **This matches the other required signal.**\n*   **Conclusion for B:** This structure is predicted to have both a `dtt` signal and a `dtq` signal. This is a perfect match for the experimental data.\n\n---\n\n#### **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n\nLet's label the key protons: `CH₃-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(Me)-CH(d)(Me)-COOH`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(d) (1H, doublet), the CH₂(b) group (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ of its methyl substituent (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** pattern. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(d):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet) and the CH₃ of its methyl substituent (3H, quartet). This gives a **dq** (doublet of quartets).\n*   **Conclusion for C:** This structure has a `dtq` signal but does not have a `dtt` signal. So, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n#### **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n\nLet's label the key protons: `CH₃(a)-CH(b)(Me)-CH(c)(Me)-CH₂(d)-COOH`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(b) (1H, doublet), the CH₂(d) group (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ of its methyl substituent (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** pattern. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet), the CH₃(a) group (3H, quartet), and the CH₃ of its methyl substituent (3H, quartet). This gives a **dqq** (doublet of quartets of quartets).\n*   **Conclusion for D:** This structure has a `dtq` signal but does not have a `dtt` signal. So, it is incorrect.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH** is consistent with all the spectroscopic data, as it is the only molecule that would produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
