    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n- T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n- A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n- R_star is the star's radius.\n- a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**3. Form the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Let's write out the expressions for each planet:\n- T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))\n- T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both. It also states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, when we take the ratio, these terms will cancel out:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a1)) * ((2 * a2) / R_star))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity (v_r) by:\nΔλ / λ_0 = v_r / c\nThe maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the amplitude of the radial velocity curve, K.\nK = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV amplitude K is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a). Assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star), the formula is:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, 'a':\nK^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\nK^2 = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1)**\nNow we can find the ratio a2 / a1 using the formula derived above:\na1 = (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)\na2 = (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)\n\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n**6. Substitute the Given Values**\nWe need the ratios M_p2 / M_p1 and K1 / K2.\n- **Mass Ratio:**\n  M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n  M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n  M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n- **RV Amplitude Ratio:**\n  The ratio K1 / K2 can be found directly from the ratio of the Doppler shifts, as the other terms (c and λ_0) are constant:\n  K1 / K2 = (c * Δλ_1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ_2 / λ_0) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n  Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n  Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n  K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**7. Final Calculation**\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nTo compare with the given options, we convert this fraction to a decimal.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes a2/a1 is given by (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\n# Mp2/Mp1 = 5/7\n# K1/K2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4\na2_over_a1 = (5/7)**2 * (3/4)**2\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures Teq1/Teq2 is sqrt(a2/a1)\nTeq1_over_Teq2 = math.sqrt(a2_over_a1)\n\nprint(Teq1_over_Teq2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.5357. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
