    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1:** solid A + 8 gas B → bright red product C\n*   **Clue 2:** C + 2 gas D → extremely hazardous product E\n*   **Clue 3:** C + H₂O → A + acid F (strong) + acid G (weak)\n*   **Clue 4:** D + B (1:1 ratio) → H (solvent)\n*   **Question:** What is the molecular symmetry group of E? The options are A) D4h, B) D∞h, C) C2, D) C2v.\n\n**2. Analyze the Most Chemically Specific Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 3 is the most revealing.** A compound C hydrolyzes to regenerate the starting material A and produce two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G).\n    *   The regeneration of A suggests A is an element.\n    *   The formation of two different acids from the hydrolysis of a substance (C) made from A and B implies that B must contain the atoms necessary for both acids.\n    *   A common strong acid is HCl. A common weak acid is HF. This suggests that the elements Chlorine (Cl) and Fluorine (F) are involved.\n    *   Let's hypothesize: **F = HCl (strong acid)** and **G = HF (weak acid)**.\n    *   This implies that gas B must be a chlorine-fluorine compound (an interhalogen).\n\n*   **Clue 4 provides a relationship between B, D, and H.**\n    *   D + B → H (solvent).\n    *   If B is an interhalogen like ClF, what gas D could react with it in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent H?\n    *   Let's test **B = ClF** (Chlorine monofluoride, a gas).\n    *   Let's test **D = F₂** (Fluorine, a gas).\n    *   The reaction is: F₂(g) + ClF(g) → ClF₃(l).\n    *   This reaction is stoichiometrically 1:1.\n    *   The product, **H = ClF₃** (Chlorine trifluoride), is a liquid at standard pressure below 12 °C and is used as a powerful fluorinating agent (a reactive solvent).\n    *   This set of identities (B=ClF, D=F₂, H=ClF₃) is chemically sound and fits Clue 4 perfectly.\n\n**3. Build the Full Story with the Identified Chemicals**\n\nNow we can propose identities for all the substances:\n*   **B = ClF** (gas)\n*   **D = F₂** (gas)\n*   **H = ClF₃** (solvent)\n*   **F = HCl** (strong acid)\n*   **G = HF** (weak acid)\n\nLet's verify these against the remaining clues.\n\n*   **Clue 1 & 3: The identity of A and C.**\n    *   We need a solid element A that reacts with ClF (B) to form a bright red product C.\n    *   And C must hydrolyze back to A, HCl, and HF.\n    *   Let's test **A = I₂** (Iodine). It is a solid element.\n    *   **Clue 1:** I₂(s) + ClF(g) → C. Iodine reacts with interhalogens to form complexes or other interhalogens (like ICl). Let's assume a bright red complex C is formed. (Note: Puzzles of this type often take liberties with color or stoichiometry. The 1:8 ratio is likely a distractor, as it's not common).\n    *   **Clue 3:** C (Iodine/Chlorine/Fluorine complex) + H₂O → I₂(s) + HCl(aq) + HF(aq). This is chemically very plausible. The complex would break down in water, regenerating the elemental iodine (A) and hydrolyzing the Cl and F components to their respective acids (F and G).\n\n*   **Clue 2: The identity of E.**\n    *   C + 2D → E\n    *   Substituting our identified substances: C (Iodine/Chlorine/Fluorine complex) + 2F₂(g) → E.\n    *   The reaction involves the complex C being treated with excess fluorine (F₂), which is an extremely powerful fluorinating agent. This will fluorinate all elements in the complex to high oxidation states.\n    *   Iodine would be converted to IF₅ or IF₇.\n    *   The chlorine (from the ClF in the complex) would be converted to ClF₃ or ClF₅.\n    *   The product E is described as a single, extremely hazardous substance. All of these potential products are indeed extremely hazardous.\n    *   Notice that **ClF₃** is one of the possible products. We also identified **H = ClF₃**. It is plausible in this puzzle that E and H are the same substance, described in two different contexts (E as a hazardous product, H as a solvent). ClF₃ fits both descriptions.\n    *   Therefore, the most likely identity for **E is ClF₃**.\n\n**4. Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\n*   We have identified **E = ClF₃** (Chlorine trifluoride).\n*   To find its symmetry, we use VSEPR theory:\n    *   The central atom is Chlorine (Cl), which is in Group 17. It has 7 valence electrons.\n    *   It forms single bonds with 3 Fluorine atoms.\n    *   Number of lone pairs = (7 - 3) / 2 = 2 lone pairs.\n    *   Total electron domains = 3 bonding pairs + 2 lone pairs = 5.\n    *   The electron geometry for 5 domains is trigonal bipyramidal.\n    *   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy the equatorial positions. The three fluorine atoms occupy the remaining two axial positions and one equatorial position.\n    *   This arrangement results in a **T-shaped** molecular geometry.\n*   A T-shaped molecule (like ClF₃) has the following symmetry elements:\n    *   A C₂ rotation axis that passes through the Cl atom and the equatorial F atom.\n    *   Two vertical mirror planes (σᵥ), one of which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   The set of symmetry elements {E, C₂, 2σᵥ} corresponds to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (ClF₃) is C₂ᵥ. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
