    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is very close to the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   Therefore, substance B is D₂O.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G and Gas W:**\n    *   Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a compound that contains deuterium and oxygen and decomposes upon heating to release D₂O. A metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, is a likely candidate, as it would decompose to a metal oxide and D₂O (e.g., Ca(OD)₂ → CaO + D₂O).\n    *   Gas W is released during the reaction and its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple molecules:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely in this context)\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely)\n    *   Given that D₂O is involved, the most plausible identity for gas W is D₂.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Substances X and Y:**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ).\n    *   The reaction produces both D₂ and M(OD)ₓ. To form D₂, the reactants must supply deuterium. To form the deuteroxide, the reactants must supply the metal (M), oxygen (O), and deuterium (D).\n    *   The problem states that X incorporates a \"heavier isotope,\" which we've identified as deuterium (D). So, X must be a deuterated compound.\n    *   Let's propose a general reaction: A deuteride (from X) reacts with an oxygen source (Y). If the gas produced is D₂, a plausible reaction is the reaction of a deuteride with D₂O.\n    *   Let X be a metal deuteride and Y be D₂O. The reaction would be: `Metal Deuteride + D₂O → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`.\n    *   This reaction type is known for being violent, especially with reactive metal hydrides/deuterides.\n\n4.  **Use the Organic Chemistry Clues to Pinpoint X:**\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards a common reagent.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid has the general formula R-C(=O)-COOH, which contains 3 oxygen atoms. The reaction with X reduces the number of oxygen atoms to 2. This means X is a reducing agent.\n    *   Common hydride reducing agents in organic chemistry include sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄. LiAlH₄ is an \"especially\" common and powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n        *   **Analog:** LiAlH₄ is a very common reagent. This fits perfectly.\n        *   **Reaction with Y=D₂O:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n        *   **Violent?** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent.\n        *   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂ gas. This fits.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** The reaction produces LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (aluminium deuteroxide), which is a gelatinous precipitate analogous to Al(OH)₃. This fits.\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause decomposition: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases D₂O (Substance B). This fits.\n        *   **Reaction with keto acid:** LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group of a keto acid (R-C(=O)-COOH) to alcohols, forming a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). The starting keto acid has 3 oxygen atoms, and the final diol product has 2 oxygen atoms. This fits perfectly.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues point to Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄. The elements are Li, Al, and D (Deuterium, ²H).\n    *   We need the atomic masses (we can use integer mass numbers as the answers are integers):\n        *   Mass of Deuterium (D): 2\n        *   Mass of Lithium (Li): 7 (using the most common isotope, ⁷Li)\n        *   Mass of Aluminium (Al): 27 (only one stable isotope, ²⁷Al)\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (D), with a mass of 2.\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (Al), with a mass of 27.\n    *   The phrase \"cumulative atomic masses\" and the instruction \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" means we must sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in the formula.\n    *   Mass of all lightest element atoms (D): There are 4 D atoms in LiAlD₄. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of all heaviest element atoms (Al): There is 1 Al atom in LiAlD₄. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative sum = (Mass of all D atoms) + (Mass of all Al atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
