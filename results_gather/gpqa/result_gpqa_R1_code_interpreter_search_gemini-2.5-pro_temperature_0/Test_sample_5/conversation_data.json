    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**1. Analyze the Potential**\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\nThe Schrödinger equation is generally easier to solve when the potential is separable. The given potential is not separable in polar coordinates because the r and θ terms are coupled. Let's try converting the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\n**2. Convert to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n*   x = r * cos(θ)\n*   y = r * sin(θ)\n*   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nSubstitute these into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (r * cos(θ))^2\nSince x = r * cos(θ), we can substitute x directly:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * x^2\n\nNow, group the terms with x^2 and y^2:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 * k) * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n**3. Identify the System**\n\nThe potential in Cartesian coordinates is:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\nThis is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The motion in the x-direction is independent of the motion in the y-direction.\n\n**4. Solve the Schrödinger Equation**\n\nBecause the potential is separable, the total Hamiltonian H is the sum of two independent 1D Hamiltonians, H = H_x + H_y, and the total energy E is the sum of the energies for each direction, E = E_x + E_y.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(q) = 1/2 * m * ω^2 * q^2 are given by:\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * ħ * ω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n**5. Calculate the Energy for the x-direction (E_x)**\n\nThe potential for the x-direction is V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2.\nWe compare this to the standard form V_x(x) = 1/2 * m * ω_x^2 * x^2:\n1/2 * m * ω_x^2 = 2 * k\nω_x^2 = 4 * k / m\nω_x = sqrt(4 * k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\nE_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * ω_x\nE_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * (2 * sqrt(k / m))\nE_{n_x} = (2 * n_x + 1) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n**6. Calculate the Energy for the y-direction (E_y)**\n\nThe potential for the y-direction is V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2.\nWe compare this to the standard form V_y(y) = 1/2 * m * ω_y^2 * y^2:\n1/2 * m * ω_y^2 = 1/2 * k\nω_y^2 = k / m\nω_y = sqrt(k / m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\nE_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * ω_y\nE_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n**7. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of E_{n_x} and E_{n_y}:\nE = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\nE = (2 * n_x + 1) * ħ * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = [(2 * n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = (2 * n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = (2 * n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
