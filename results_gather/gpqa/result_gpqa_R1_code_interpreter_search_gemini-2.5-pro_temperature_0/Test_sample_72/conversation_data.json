    "This problem requires us to calculate two quantities from special relativity: the relative speed of two objects and the total energy of the system.\n\n**1. Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nThe formula for the relativistic velocity subtraction (since both astronauts are moving in the same direction) is given by:\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)\n\nGiven:\n*   v₁ = 0.6c (velocity of the first astronaut)\n*   v₂ = 0.5c (velocity of the second astronaut)\n*   c = speed of light\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7\nv_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula:\nE = γ * m₀ * c²\nwhere:\n*   γ (Lorentz factor) = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   m₀ is the rest mass of the particle.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts (E_total = E₁ + E₂).\n\n**For Astronaut 1:**\n*   Rest mass (m₁) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v₁) = 0.6c\n*   Calculate γ₁:\n    γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Calculate E₁:\n    E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**For Astronaut 2:**\n*   Rest mass (m₂) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v₂) = 0.5c\n*   Calculate γ₂:\n    γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) = 1 / (√3 / 2) = 2 / √3 ≈ 1.1547\n*   Calculate E₂:\n    E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² = (2/√3) * (3m) * c² = (6/√3) mc² = 2√3 mc² ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total Energy of the System:**\nE_total = E₁ + E₂\nE_total = 2.5 mc² + 2√3 mc²\nE_total = (2.5 + 2√3) mc²\nE_total ≈ (2.5 + 3.464) mc²\nE_total ≈ 5.964 mc²\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated relative speed is v_rel ≈ 0.14c and the total energy is E ≈ 5.96 mc². This matches option A.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv1 = 0.6  # in units of c\nv2 = 0.5  # in units of c\nm1 = 2    # in units of m\nm2 = 3    # in units of m\n\n# 1.

    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\n*   The relative speed (v_rel) between them.\n*   The total energy (E_total) of the system.\n\n**2. Given Information**\n\n*   Mass of Astronaut 1 (m₁): 2m\n*   Velocity of Astronaut 1 (v₁): 0.6c (in the positive x-direction)\n*   Mass of Astronaut 2 (m₂): 3m\n*   Velocity of Astronaut 2 (v₂): 0.5c (in the positive x-direction)\n*   c: the speed of light\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince both astronauts are moving in the same direction, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula:\n\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)\n\n*   Substitute the given velocities:\n    v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\n\n*   Simplify the numerator and the term in the denominator:\n    v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\n    v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)\n\n*   Perform the final calculation:\n    v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7\n    v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ **0.14c**\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts (E_total = E₁ + E₂).\n\nThe formula for the relativistic energy of a single particle is:\nE = γ * m₀ * c²\nwhere m₀ is the rest mass and γ (the Lorentz factor) is γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 (E₁):**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₁) for astronaut 1:\n        γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (v₁/c)²) = 1 / √(1 - (0.6)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n    *   Now, calculate the energy (E₁):\n        E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 (E₂):**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₂) for astronaut 2:\n        γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (v₂/c)²) = 1 / √(1 - (0.5)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1.1547\n    *   Now, calculate the energy (E₂):\n        E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n*   **Total Energy (E_total):**\n    *   Sum the individual energies:\n        E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²\n        E_total ≈ **5.96 mc²**\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
