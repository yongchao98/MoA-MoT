    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental quantities:**\n    *   **Stellar Density (ρ):** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. This means the number of stars per unit volume, ρ, is constant throughout space.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is the apparent shift of a star against the background as the Earth orbits the Sun. It is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. The relationship is given by `plx = 1/d` (when parallax is measured in arcseconds and distance in parsecs). From this, we can write the distance as `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Number of Stars (N):** We want to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, depends on `plx`.\n\n2.  **Consider the number of stars in a volume of space:**\n    *   Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the Sun. This shell has a radius `d` and a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n        `dV = (Surface Area of Sphere) * (thickness)`\n        `dV = 4 * π * d^2 * dd`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in this shell:**\n    *   Since the stellar density (ρ) is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) in this small volume (`dV`) is:\n        `dN = ρ * dV`\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d^2 * dd`\n\n4.  **Express the relationship in terms of parallax (plx):**\n    *   Our goal is to find `dN/d(plx)`. Currently, our expression for `dN` is in terms of `d` and `dd`. We need to substitute these with expressions involving `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   Now, we need to relate `dd` to `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the expression for `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d = plx⁻¹`\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   When we consider the number of stars in a range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n        `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Substitute back into the equation for dN:**\n    *   Start with the equation: `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Now substitute `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Combine the terms:\n        `dN = (4 * π * ρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the final relationship:**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the term `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the equation from the previous step:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4 * π * ρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse of the parallax to the fourth power.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 1/plx¹\nB) ~ 1/plx⁴\nC) ~ 1/plx²\nD) ~ 1/plx³\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
