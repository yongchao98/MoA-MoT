    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This transition cannot happen via a single electric dipole (E1) transition because the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ is violated ($l$ goes from 0 to 0, so $\\Delta l = 0$). The problem states it occurs via \"two dipole transition\", and the options specify a \"transition route\", which implies a cascade process involving a real intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** A cascade decay involves two sequential single-photon emissions.\n    *   Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle + \\gamma_1$\n    *   Step 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle + \\gamma_2$\n\n    For each step, the electric dipole selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be anything, but for emission, the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease in each step.\n\n    *   **Applying rules to Step 1:**\n        *   Initial state: $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, $m'$ can be $0, 1, -1$.\n        *   For a cascade, the intermediate state must have an energy between the initial and final states. This means $1 < n' < 3$, so $n'$ must be 2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Applying rules to Step 2:**\n        *   Final state: $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ($n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$).\n        *   Let's check if the possible intermediate states can decay to the final state.\n        *   Initial state for this step is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   So, all three routes are physically possible:\n            1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n            2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n            3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route:** The \"probability\" of a specific route corresponds to its branching ratio in the overall cascade process. The probability of a given cascade path is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, multiplied by the branching ratio of the second step.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio of Step 2:** The intermediate state is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (a $2p$ state). The only allowed E1 decay channel for a $2p$ state is to the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). Decay to the $2s$ state ($|2,0,0\\rangle$) is forbidden ($\\Delta l= -1$ is okay, but $2p \\to 2s$ is an E1-forbidden transition in H-like atoms due to the radial matrix element). Therefore, once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with 100% probability. The branching ratio for the second step is 1 for all three routes.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio of Step 1:** We need to find the relative probabilities of the transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. The probability of a transition is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element. The key insight here comes from symmetry.\n        *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space.\n        *   The decay process (spontaneous emission), when averaged over all emission directions and photon polarizations, is isotropic.\n        *   The three possible final states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields) and are only distinguished by their spatial orientation (the value of $m'$).\n        *   Since the initial state and the decay interaction are both isotropic, there can be no preference for producing one orientation over another. Therefore, the three $m'$ sub-levels must be populated with equal probability.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on Probabilities:** There are three possible routes, and each is equally likely. The total probability must sum to 1. Therefore, the probability for each specific route is $1/3$.\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Probability is incorrect)\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Probability is incorrect)\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Route and probability are correct)\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

    "The problem asks for a valid decay route and its probability for the transition of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the selection rules for E1 transitions.\nAn electric dipole transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is governed by the following selection rules:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  The principal quantum number $n$ can change by any integer value ($\\Delta n = \\text{any integer}$), but for emission, the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible intermediate states.\nThe process is a two-step cascade:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta n < 0$: The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$. For a cascade to the $n=1$ state, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   Let's check if our possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ can decay to the final state.\n*   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: The change is $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: The change is $m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n*   So, all three routes are physically possible:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability of each route.\nThe \"probability\" of a specific route is its branching ratio.\n*   **Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the $2p$ subshell), its only allowed E1 decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the $1s$ state). Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1 for all three routes.\n*   **First Step:** We need to find the relative probabilities of the transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space.\n    *   The decay process (spontaneous emission), when averaged over all photon emission directions and polarizations, is an isotropic process.\n    *   The three possible final states for this step, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields) and only differ by their spatial orientation (the value of $m'$).\n    *   Because the initial state and the interaction are both isotropic, there can be no preference for producing one orientation ($m'$) over another. Therefore, the three degenerate $m'$ sub-levels must be populated with equal probability.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since there are three equally likely routes, and the total probability must sum to 1, the probability for each specific route is $1/3$.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the given options.\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability is C. The Python code execution confirms that the branching ratio for each of the three possible decay paths is indeed $1/3$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
