    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (`Pi(+)`) into a positive muon (`mu(+)`) and a muon neutrino (`nu`). We need to find the kinetic energies of the two product particles. This can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in the framework of special relativity.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   The `Pi(+)` is stationary.\n*   Initial momentum, `p_initial` = 0.\n*   Initial total energy, `E_initial`, is its rest energy: `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`.\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   The final state consists of a `mu(+)` and a `nu`.\n*   Let their total energies be `E_mu` and `E_nu`, and their momenta be `p_mu` and `p_nu`.\n*   Final total energy, `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n*   Final total momentum, `p_final = p_mu + p_nu`.\n\n**3. Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    `p_initial = p_final`\n    `0 = p_mu + p_nu`\n    This implies `p_mu = -p_nu`. The two particles are emitted in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n    `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n**4. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest mass `m` of a particle are related by:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the muon (`mu(+)`):\n    `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the neutrino (`nu`):\n    Neutrinos have a very small mass, which is considered negligible in this context. We assume `m_nu = 0`.\n    `E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_nu*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2`\n    Therefore, `E_nu = p*c`.\n\n**5. Solving for the Energies:**\n\nWe can now solve the system of equations.\nFrom the neutrino's energy relation, we have `(p*c)^2 = E_nu^2`. Substitute this into the muon's energy equation:\n`E_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nFrom the conservation of energy, we have `E_mu = m_pi*c^2 - E_nu`. Substitute this into the equation above:\n`(m_pi*c^2 - E_nu)^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nExpand the left side:\n`(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*E_nu + E_nu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nThe `E_nu^2` terms on both sides cancel out. Rearranging to solve for `E_nu`:\n`2*(m_pi*c^2)*E_nu = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n`E_nu = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi*c^2) ]`\n\nSince the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy `KE_nu` is equal to its total energy `E_nu`.\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energy of the muon, `KE_mu`.\n`KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2`\nWe know `E_mu = m_pi*c^2 - E_nu`.\nSo, `KE_mu = (m_pi*c^2 - E_nu) - m_mu*c^2`.\n\n**6. Calculation:**\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculations with the given values:\n*   Rest mass energy of `Pi(+)`, `m_pi*c^2` = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of `mu(+)`, `m_mu*c^2` = 105.7 MeV\n\n```python\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the neutrino (E_nu)\n# Since the neutrino is considered massless, its kinetic energy (KE_nu) is its total energy.\nE_nu = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu) using conservation of energy\nE_mu = m_pi - E_nu\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# Print the results, formatted to two decimal places as in the options\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the muon is {KE_mu:.2f} MeV.\")\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the neutrino is {KE_nu:.2f} MeV.\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n```python\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the neutrino (E_nu)\n# Since the neutrino is considered massless, its kinetic energy (KE_nu) is its total energy.\nE_nu = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu) using conservation of energy\nE_mu = m_pi - E_nu\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# Print the results, formatted to two decimal places as in the options\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the muon is {KE_mu:.2f} MeV.\")\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the neutrino is {KE_nu:.2f} MeV.\")\n```\n</execute_code>\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is 4.12 MeV.\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino is 29.78 MeV.\n\nThe calculated values are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (`mu(+)`) and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino (`nu`). These values correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",

Solve for the Energies:**\n\nWe can now combine these equations to solve for the unknown energies.\n\n1.  Substitute `E_nu = p*c` into the muon's energy equation:\n    `E_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\n2.  From the conservation of energy, rearrange to get `E_mu = m_pi*c^2 - E_nu`.\n\n3.
