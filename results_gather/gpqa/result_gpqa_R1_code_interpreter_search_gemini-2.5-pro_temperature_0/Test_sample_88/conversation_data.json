    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given reaction sequence and spectral data.**\n\n1.  **Reaction 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with excess KOH at 240°C to give Product 1.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). It has 14 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Product 1 Data:**\n        *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n        *   ¹H NMR: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The total integration is 2 + 10 + 2 = 14 protons.\n    *   **Inference:** The formula of Product 1 is C₁₀H₁₄O. The degree of unsaturation is (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4. A C=O group accounts for one degree, so the molecule must have three rings. This means Product 1 is a saturated tricyclic ketone, an isomer of adamantanone.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide to form Product 2.\n    *   **Reagents:** Al(O-iPr)₃ is the classic reagent for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols.\n\n3.  **Reaction 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS) to form Product 3.\n    *   **Reagents:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. This reaction specifically cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n\n**Step 2: Identify and resolve the central contradiction.**\n\n*   From Reaction 3, we know that Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond to react with ozone.\n*   The MPV reduction (Reaction 2) converts a C=O to a C-OH and does not create a C=C bond. Therefore, if Product 2 has a C=C bond, Product 1 must also have had a C=C bond.\n*   If Product 1 is an unsaturated ketone (containing both C=O and C=C), its formula, derived from the C₁₀ adamantane skeleton, should be C₁₀H₁₂O.\n*   However, the NMR data for Product 1 clearly shows 14 protons, implying a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O, which corresponds to a saturated ketone.\n\nThis is a direct contradiction. One piece of the provided information must be misleading or requires a non-obvious interpretation. Let's evaluate the possibilities:\n*   Possibility A: The NMR integration is wrong.\n*   Possibility B: The ozonolysis reaction is not happening on a C=C bond. (Unlikely, as this is its primary function under these conditions).\n*   Possibility C: The reaction with Al(O-iPr)₃ is not a simple reduction but also causes a subsequent reaction.\n\nLet's explore Possibility C, as it is chemically plausible. Heating an alcohol (the initial reduction product) with a Lewis acid like Al(O-iPr)₃ can cause dehydration to form an alkene. The reaction sequence would be:\n*   **Product 1 (Saturated Ketone)** --(MPV reduction)--> **Intermediate Alcohol** --(Dehydration)--> **Product 2 (Alkene)**.\n\nThis revised pathway resolves the contradiction. Product 1 is a saturated ketone (C₁₀H₁₄O), and Product 2 is an alkene (C₁₀H₁₄), which can undergo ozonolysis. The unusual NMR data for Product 1 remains a puzzle, but we can proceed by identifying the likely structures based on the reaction chemistry.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structures of the products.**\n\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with a strong base at high temperature is known to cause skeletal rearrangement. A likely product is **protoadamantan-4-one**. This is a saturated tricyclic ketone with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. (We will proceed assuming this is the structure, despite the conflicting NMR data provided in the problem, as it is the most plausible chemical outcome).\n\n*   **Product 2:** Protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol, which is then dehydrated. Dehydration of an alcohol, especially one that can lead to a more stable rearranged skeleton, is complex. A plausible rearrangement under these conditions (heating with a Lewis acid) is from the less stable protoadamantane skeleton to a more stable isomer. A known stable C₁₀H₁₄ alkene isomer is **twistene** (tricyclo[4.4.0.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). Twistene is highly symmetric (D₂ symmetry).\n\n*   **Product 3:** Ozonolysis of twistene. The ozonolysis of twistene is a known reaction. It cleaves the double bond in one of the six-membered rings to form a C₁₀ dialdehyde. The product is **cis-cyclohexane-1,3-diacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with two -CH₂CHO groups attached at positions 1 and 3, with a cis relationship.\n    *   Formula: C₆H₁₀(CH₂CHO)₂ = C₁₀H₁₄O₂. This is consistent with the ozonolysis of a C₁₀H₁₄ alkene.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Product 3:** cis-cyclohexane-1,3-diacetaldehyde.\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Identify the most deshielded proton:** In this structure, the most deshielded protons are the aldehyde protons (-CHO) due to the strong deshielding effect of the carbonyl group. Their chemical shift is typically in the 9-10 ppm range. Aldehyde protons do not exchange with D₂O.\n*   **Determine the coupling pattern:** Let's analyze one of the aldehyde protons. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, both aldehyde protons are chemically equivalent and will have the same signal. The aldehyde proton is separated by three bonds from the two protons on the adjacent methylene group (the -CH₂- in the -CH₂CHO fragment).\n    *   Coupling: H-C(=O)-CH₂-\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to 'n' equivalent neighboring protons will be split into 'n+1' peaks. Here, the aldehyde proton is coupled to the two protons of the CH₂ group (n=2).\n    *   Therefore, the signal for the aldehyde proton will be a **triplet** (2+1 = 3 peaks).\n\nThis result matches one of the given options.\n\nFinal check:\n*   The path P1(protoadamantanone) -> P2(twistene) -> P3(cis-cyclohexane-1,3-diacetaldehyde) is chemically plausible, even if it involves non-trivial rearrangements.\n*   This path resolves the contradictions in the initial data.\n*   The analysis of the final product's NMR spectrum leads directly to one of the answers.\n\nThe coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (the aldehyde proton) in product 3 is a triplet.\n\n<<<B>>>"
