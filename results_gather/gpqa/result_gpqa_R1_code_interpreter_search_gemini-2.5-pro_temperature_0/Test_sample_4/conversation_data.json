    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the given information:**\n*   The operator $\\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x$, $\\sigma_y$, and $\\sigma_z$.\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector that lies in the x-z plane.\n*   We need to find the eigenvector of the operator $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n\n**2. Define the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:**\nA general unit vector in 3D space is given in spherical coordinates by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$. Since the vector lies in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. This means $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. We can choose the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$. The angle $\\theta$ then represents the angle the vector makes with the z-axis.\nSo, the unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n**3. Construct the operator $P_n$:**\nThe operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\nSubstituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\cos\\theta$\nCombine the terms:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Set up the eigenvalue equation:**\nWe are looking for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that satisfies the equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$, with the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**5. Solve the eigenvalue equation:**\nWe can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides of the equation:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\nThis matrix equation represents a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio of $b$ to $a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\nNow, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities: $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$.\n$b (2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)) = a (2\\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\nAssuming $\\theta \\neq 0$ (so that $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides by $2\\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n$b \\cos(\\theta/2) = a \\sin(\\theta/2)$\nThis gives the relationship between the components $a$ and $b$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nThis means the eigenvector is of the form $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$, where $C$ is a normalization constant.\n\n**6. Normalize the eigenvector:**\nThe normalization condition for a quantum state is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$, which for our 2-component vector means $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\nLet the unnormalized eigenvector be $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. The squared norm is:\n$\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\nThe vector is already normalized. So, we can take the normalization constant $C=1$.\nThe normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**7. Compare with the options:**\nThe elements of the calculated normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\nLet's examine the given choices:\nA) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$\nB) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$\nC) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$\nD) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$\n\nOur result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
