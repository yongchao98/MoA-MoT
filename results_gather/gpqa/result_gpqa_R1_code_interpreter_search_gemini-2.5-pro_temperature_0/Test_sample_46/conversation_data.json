    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The DBE is calculated to determine the number of rings and/or double bonds.\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    DBE = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) plus one additional double bond (1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region is characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an **ester**, specifically an aromatic ester. It is generally too high for an amide and too low for a phenyl ester.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents are electronically different. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons corresponds to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group** identified from the IR spectrum. Its broadness is due to quadrupole broadening and chemical exchange. The -NH₂ group is an electron-donating group, which is consistent with the upfield aromatic doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is characteristic of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm corresponds to the methyl (-CH₃) protons, which are split by the two adjacent methylene protons (n+1 = 2+1 = 3 peaks).\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm corresponds to the methylene (-CH₂) protons, which are split by the three adjacent methyl protons (n+1 = 3+1 = 4 peaks).\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the methylene quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester group (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**. The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group, consistent with the downfield aromatic doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPlacing the electron-donating -NH₂ group and the electron-withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is consistent with all the spectral data.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: C₉H₁₁NO₂, primary amine, ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. Also, 1,3-substitution would produce a more complex aromatic NMR pattern.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this ester, the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for this methylene group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and one N-H proton in the NMR. It would also have a formyl proton (-CHO) signal above 8 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
