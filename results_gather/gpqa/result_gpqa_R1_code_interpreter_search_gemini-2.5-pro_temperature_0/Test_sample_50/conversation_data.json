    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the sphere. We need to find the total potential energy of this entire system (the charge `q` plus the sphere with its induced charges).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** This is a classic electrostatics problem that is best solved using the \"method of images.\" The principle is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" placed inside the sphere. This image charge, along with the original charge `q`, must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   Let the image charge be `q'` located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n    *   For the potential to be zero at any point on the sphere's surface (a distance `R` from the center), the image charge must be:\n        *   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   And its position must be: `b = R^2/d`\n    *   With this image charge `q'` at position `b`, the potential created by `q` and `q'` on the surface of the sphere is indeed zero. Therefore, for any point outside the sphere, the electric field and potential are correctly described by the combination of the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy (U):**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common mistake is to simply calculate the interaction energy between `q` and `q'`. The correct formula for the energy of a system of conductors and charges is `U = (1/2) Σ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\n    *   In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the charge on the sphere.\n    *   The potential of the sphere is `V_sphere = 0` (it's grounded).\n    *   The potential at the location of the charge `q` is the sum of its own potential (which we don't count in the interaction energy) and the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere, let's call this `V_induced`.\n    *   The formula for the total energy simplifies to `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. The term for the sphere is `(1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`, which is zero.\n\n5.  **Finding V_induced:**\n    *   The potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` (distance `d` from the center) is, by the method of images, the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `distance = d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n    *   So, the potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        where `k = 1/(4πε₀)`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - R^2/d]`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation of Energy (U):**\n    *   Now, substitute the expression for `V_induced` back into our energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option A. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, and the system has lower energy than when the charge is at infinity (where U=0).\n\n<<<A>>>"
