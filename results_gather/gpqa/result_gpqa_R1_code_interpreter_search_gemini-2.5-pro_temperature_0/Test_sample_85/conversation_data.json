    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactions and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThe product in both cases is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester functional group, which is known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at carbon 4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\nLactones like this are formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. Specifically, a delta-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid. The precursor to our product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nLet's verify the naming:\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)`\nWhen the hydroxyl group on carbon 5 attacks the carboxylic acid on carbon 1, it forms a six-membered ring. The atoms in the ring are -O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-. According to IUPAC nomenclature for heterocycles, the oxygen is position 1, the carbonyl carbon is 2, and the carbon with the ethyl group is position 4. Thus, the name is **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. The chiral center in the starting acid (C3) becomes the chiral center in the lactone (C4).\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reducing Agents**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This molecule has two key functional groups:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid** (-COOH)\n2.  An **ester** (-CO-O-iBu)\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with different selectivities:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a relatively mild reducing agent. It selectively reduces aldehydes, ketones, and **esters**. It does **not** reduce carboxylic acids (or their conjugate bases, carboxylates).\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols. It is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n### **3. Elucidate the Pathway for Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄\n*   **Product:** (R)-lactone\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester** group of compound A to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched (it will be deprotonated to a carboxylate salt).\n    `(A) HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(1. LiBH₄)--> [⁻OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH] Li⁺`\n2.  **Workup and Cyclization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylate and the alkoxide, forming the intermediate **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. This hydroxy acid then undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH --(H⁺)--> (lactone) + H₂O`\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization reactions do not affect the chiral center at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **4. Elucidate the Pathway for Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃\n*   **Product:** (S)-lactone\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group of compound B to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group untouched.\n    `(B) HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(1. BH₃; 2. workup)--> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu`\n2.  **Cyclization:** The product of this reduction is a hydroxy-ester (**isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**). During the acidic workup (H⁺), this molecule can undergo an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) and forming the stable six-membered lactone.\n    `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(H⁺)--> (lactone) + iBuOH`\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** As in reaction 1, the reaction steps do not affect the chiral center. The stereochemistry is retained.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
