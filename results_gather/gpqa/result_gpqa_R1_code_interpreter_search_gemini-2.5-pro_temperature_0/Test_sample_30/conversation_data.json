    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically nitration. The methyl group (-CH3) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing activator. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the para isomer is typically the major product. We will assume Product 1 is the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n    ```\n        CH3\n         |\n        / \\\n       |   |\n       \\ /\n        |\n        NO2\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This combination of reagents is a strong oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes the benzylic methyl group to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitro group (-NO2) is resistant to this oxidation.\n*   **Product 2:** p-nitrobenzoic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid).\n    ```\n        COOH\n          |\n         / \\\n        |   |\n        \\ /\n         |\n         NO2\n    ```\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzoic acid) is treated with acetone ((CH3)2C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction proceeds in several stages:\n    1.  **Acid-Base Reaction:** The acidic proton of the carboxylic acid reacts with the strong base (NaOH) to form sodium p-nitrobenzoate.\n    2.  **Enolate Formation:** The base (NaOH) also removes an alpha-proton from acetone to form the acetone enolate ion (`⁻CH₂COCH₃`), which is a strong nucleophile.\n    3.  **Nucleophilic Aromatic Addition:** The acetone enolate attacks the electron-deficient aromatic ring of the p-nitrobenzoate anion. The ring is activated for nucleophilic attack by the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group. The product of this addition is a resonance-stabilized carbanion known as a Meisenheimer complex.\n\n*   **Position of Attack and Structure of Product 3:** The nucleophile can attack several positions on the ring. The most likely positions are those that lead to the most stable intermediate.\n    *   **Ortho-attack:** Attack at the positions ortho to the nitro group (C3 or C5) is common. This would create a chiral center at the point of attack, as the sp³ carbon would be bonded to four different groups (H, -CH₂COCH₃, and two different parts of the ring). A molecule with a single chiral center has a C₁ point group, which is not among the options.\n    *   **Ipso-attack:** Attack can also occur at the carbon atom that already bears a substituent, in this case, the nitro group (this is called ipso-attack). The acetone enolate attacks the C4 carbon (the one bonded to the NO₂ group).\n\n    Let's analyze the symmetry of the product formed from ipso-attack.\n    The structure of the resulting Meisenheimer complex (Product 3) is:\n    ```\n            COO⁻\n              |\n             C1\n            /  \\\n        H--C2==C6--H\n           |   |\n        H--C3==C5--H\n            \\  /\n             C4\n            /  \\\n          NO₂   CH₂COCH₃\n    ```\n    In this structure, the C4 carbon is sp³ hybridized, while the other five carbons of the ring form a pentadienyl anion system.\n\n**Symmetry Analysis of Product 3**\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group (point group), we look for symmetry elements in the structure resulting from ipso-attack.\n\n1.  **Identity (E):** Present in all molecules.\n2.  **Proper Axes of Rotation (Cₙ):** There are no Cₙ axes of rotation (for n > 1).\n3.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Consider a plane that contains the C1-C4 axis and is perpendicular to the plane of the ring. This plane also contains the carboxylate group (COO⁻), the nitro group (NO₂), and the acetonyl group (-CH₂COCH₃).\n    *   Reflection across this plane maps C2 to C6 (both are CH groups).\n    *   Reflection across this plane maps C3 to C5 (both are CH groups).\n    *   All atoms on the plane (at C1, C4, and the substituents) are mapped onto themselves.\n    Since the molecule is unchanged by this reflection, it possesses a plane of symmetry (σ).\n4.  **Center of Inversion (i) and Improper Axes (Sₙ):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion or any Sₙ axes.\n\nA molecule that has only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence leads to a Meisenheimer complex formed via ipso-attack of the acetone enolate on p-nitrobenzoate. This product has a single plane of symmetry, and its molecular symmetry group is Cₛ. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
