    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment is given by the vector operator `μ⃗ = γS⃗`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S⃗` is the spin operator.\n    *   The magnetic field is `B⃗ = B ẑ`.\n    *   The Hamiltonian of the system is `H = -μ⃗ ⋅ B⃗ = -γ(S⃗ ⋅ B ẑ) = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field,\" which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of this Hamiltonian.\n    *   The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (for the spin-up state `|+z>`) and `-ħ/2` (for the spin-down state `|-z>`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is `E_up`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is the spin-up state along the z-axis.\n    *   Initial state: `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian (t > 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to `B⃗' = B ŷ`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H' = -μ⃗ ⋅ B⃗' = -γ(S⃗ ⋅ B ŷ) = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state of the particle for `t > 0` evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, governed by the new Hamiltonian `H'`.\n    *   The state at time `t` is given by: `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iH't/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n    *   Substituting `H'` and `|ψ(0)>`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = e^(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) |+z> = e^(iγB S_y t/ħ) |+z>`.\n    *   Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The expression simplifies to:\n        `|ψ(t)> = e^(iωt S_y/ħ) |+z>`.\n    *   This operator represents a rotation of the spin state around the y-axis by an angle `θ = ωt`.\n\n4.  **Express the Initial State in the Eigenbasis of the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   To easily calculate the effect of the time evolution operator, we express the initial state `|+z>` in terms of the eigenstates of `S_y`, which are `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    *   The relationship between the z-basis and y-basis eigenstates is:\n        `|+y> = (1/√2) (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n        `|-y> = (1/√2) (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    *   By adding these two equations, we can solve for `|+z>`:\n        `|+z> = (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n\n5.  **Apply the Time Evolution Operator:**\n    *   Now we apply the time evolution operator to the initial state expressed in the `S_y` basis.\n        `|ψ(t)> = e^(iωt S_y/ħ) [ (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>) ]`\n    *   Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates of `S_y` with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2` respectively:\n        `e^(iωt S_y/ħ) |+y> = e^(iωt(ħ/2)/ħ) |+y> = e^(iωt/2) |+y>`\n        `e^(iωt S_y/ħ) |-y> = e^(iωt(-ħ/2)/ħ) |-y> = e^(-iωt/2) |-y>`\n    *   Substituting these back, we get the state at time `t`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ e^(iωt/2) |+y> + e^(-iωt/2) |-y> ]`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    *   We need to find the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`, which is `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   To do this, it's easiest to convert `|ψ(t)>` back to the z-basis.\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ e^(iωt/2) (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + e^(-iωt/2) (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) [ (e^(iωt/2) + e^(-iωt/2))|+z> + i(e^(iωt/2) - e^(-iωt/2))|-z> ]`\n    *   Using Euler's formulas (`cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2` and `sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/(2i)`):\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2) |+z> - sin(ωt/2) |-z>`\n    *   Now we can calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`:\n        `<S_z(t)> = ( <+z|cos(ωt/2) - <-z|sin(ωt/2) ) S_z ( cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z> )`\n        `S_z |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `S_z |-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`.\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos²(ωt/2) - (-ħ/2) sin²(ωt/2)`\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(ωt)`\n\n7.  **Identify the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n    *   This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The term inside the cosine function is `ωt`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n    *   We defined the Larmor frequency as `ω = γB`.\n    *   Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector, initially pointing along the +Z axis, begins to precess around the new magnetic field axis (+Y) at the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The projection of the spin onto the Z-axis oscillates as a cosine function with this frequency.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nOur calculated frequency `γB` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
