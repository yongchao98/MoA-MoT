    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a C2 axis of symmetry.\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning both C-O bonds form on the same face of the double bond.\n    *   When a trans-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, it forms a trans-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is achiral and the reagent (mCPBA) is achiral, the product must be either achiral or a racemic mixture.\n    *   The product, trans-4,5-epoxyoctane, is chiral. Therefore, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The epoxide is treated with aqueous acid (H3O+). This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis that opens the epoxide ring to form a diol. The mechanism involves a backside attack by a water molecule on the protonated epoxide. This is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The water molecule attacks from the side opposite the C-O bonds. Attack at C4 inverts the stereocenter from R to S, giving (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 inverts the stereocenter from R to S, giving (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two are the same molecule.\n    *   This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a center of inversion and is therefore a *meso* compound (an achiral molecule with stereocenters).\n    *   If we start with the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, the same *meso* compound is formed.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, the meso compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   When a cis-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, it forms a cis-epoxide.\n    *   The product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry passing through the oxygen atom and bisecting the C-C bond. It is a *meso* compound.\n*   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** This is an *anti*-addition of water to the epoxide.\n    *   Starting with the meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, the backside attack by water will lead to a mixture of products.\n    *   Attack at C4 inverts the stereocenter from R to S, giving (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 inverts the stereocenter from S to R, giving (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the starting meso-epoxide is symmetrical, attack at C4 and C5 is equally probable.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the stereochemical relationships:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso isomer (4R,5S) is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) isomer and the (4S,5S) isomer.\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. They will elute at different times, appearing as distinct peaks.\n    *   In our mixture, the enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) will co-elute as **one peak**. The meso compound, being a diastereomer to the enantiomers, will be separated and appear as a **second peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC: 2**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column can distinguish between the two enantiomers, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), because they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase. They will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two and will also be separated. It will appear as a **third peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>"
