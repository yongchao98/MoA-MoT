    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂(C=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   It has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new chiral center (C3).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Since one chiral center is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces a mixture of two diastereomeric compounds.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-(C=O)-CH₂-(C=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and symmetric.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol, CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃. This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereoisomers:** Because the molecule is symmetric, we need to consider the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent produces a racemic mixture (equal amounts) of this enantiomeric pair.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through the CH₂ group), making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (it is the same meso compound).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the separation on a normal-phase HPLC column.**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is **achiral**. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated** on a normal-phase column. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n*   Let's analyze the combined mixture of products from both reactions:\n    *   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** We have a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The enantiomeric pair will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated and give a second peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different and will have different retention times. Thus, there will be no accidental overlap of peaks.\n*   **Total peaks on normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the separation on a chiral HPLC column.**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a **chiral stationary phase**. It can distinguish between stereoisomers by forming transient diastereomeric complexes with different stabilities.\n*   A chiral column can separate **both enantiomers and diastereomers**.\n*   Let's analyze the combined mixture:\n    *   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** We have a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers from each other. The meso compound will also be separated from the enantiomers. This gives **3 peaks**.\n*   Again, assuming no accidental overlap between the products of the two reactions.\n*   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = 5 peaks.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
