    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Observability Conditions**\n\nA star can be observed by a telescope only if it meets two main criteria:\n*   **Positional Visibility:** The star must rise above the horizon at the observatory's location. This depends on the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n*   **Brightness:** The star's apparent magnitude must be brighter than the instrument's sensitivity limit.\n\nFor a star to be detected by **both** ESPRESSO and HIRES, it must satisfy the conditions for both observatories simultaneously.\n\n**2. Determine the Positional Visibility for Both Observatories**\n\nFirst, we need the latitudes of the two observatories from the provided links.\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located at latitude ~24.6° S.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located at latitude ~19.8° N.\n\nA star is visible from an observatory if its declination allows it to rise above the horizon.\n*   For Keck Observatory (Northern Hemisphere, lat ≈ +20°), it can observe stars with declinations greater than approximately -70° (i.e., DEC > -70°).\n*   For Paranal Observatory (Southern Hemisphere, lat ≈ -25°), it can observe stars with declinations less than approximately +65° (i.e., DEC < +65°).\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range: **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n\n**3. Determine the Brightness Limit for Both Observatories**\n\n*   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17 (m_V < 17).\n*   HIRES can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 16 (m_V < 16).\n\nFor a star to be detected by **both**, it must be bright enough for the less sensitive instrument (HIRES). Therefore, the combined requirement is **m_V < 16**.\n\n**4. Analyze Each Star**\n\nWe will now check each star against the combined visibility (-70° < DEC < +65°) and brightness (m_V < 16) criteria.\n\nWe use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (m) when the absolute magnitude (M), distance (d), and extinction (A_V) are given:\n`m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nwhere `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n---\n**Star 1**\n*   DEC = -75°\n*   **Visibility:** -75° is not within the range -70° < DEC < +65°. It is too far south to be seen from Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n**Star 2**\n*   DEC = +55°\n*   m_V = 16.5 mag\n*   **Visibility:** +55° is within the range -70° < DEC < +65°. It is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Brightness:** m_V = 16.5. This is not brighter than 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** Too faint to be observed by HIRES. Cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n**Star 3**\n*   DEC = +48°\n*   m_V = 15.5 mag (This is the observed apparent magnitude, including extinction effects).\n*   **Visibility:** +48° is within the range -70° < DEC < +65°. It is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Brightness:** m_V = 15.5. This is brighter than 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n---\n**Star 4**\n*   DEC = -48°\n*   M = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n*   **Visibility:** -48° is within the range -70° < DEC < +65°. It is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   Extinction: `A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24` mag.\n    *   Apparent magnitude: `m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74` mag.\n    *   16.74 is not brighter than 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** Too faint to be observed by HIRES. Cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n**Star 5**\n*   DEC = +60°\n*   M = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc, E(B-V) = 0\n*   **Visibility:** +60° is within the range -70° < DEC < +65°. It is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   Extinction: `A_V = 0`.\n    *   Apparent magnitude: `m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995` mag.\n    *   m_V ≈ 15.0. This is brighter than 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n**5.

    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we need to check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Positional Visibility:** The star's declination (DEC) must be within the observable range for both observatories.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude (m_V) must be brighter than the limiting magnitude of *both* instruments.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Combined Observational Constraints**\n\n*   **Positional Visibility:**\n    *   Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere (Latitude ≈ -24.6°). It can observe stars with declinations roughly less than +65°.\n    *   Keck Observatory is in the Northern Hemisphere (Latitude ≈ +19.8°). It can observe stars with declinations roughly greater than -70°.\n    *   For a star to be visible from **both**, its declination must be in the overlapping range: **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n\n*   **Brightness Limit:**\n    *   ESPRESSO can observe stars with m_V < 17.\n    *   HIRES can observe stars with m_V < 16.\n    *   For a star to be detected by **both**, it must be bright enough for the more restrictive instrument (HIRES). Therefore, the combined requirement is **m_V < 16**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Star**\n\nWe will use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (m) when the absolute magnitude (M) is given: `m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `d` is the distance in parsecs and `A_V` is the extinction in the V band. Extinction is calculated as `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   DEC = -75°. This is outside the observable range for Keck Observatory (DEC > -70°).\n    *   **Conclusion: Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   DEC = +55°. This is within the observable range for both observatories.\n    *   Apparent V magnitude m_V = 16.5 mag. This is not brighter than the required m_V < 16.\n    *   **Conclusion: Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   DEC = +48°. This is within the observable range for both observatories.\n    *   Apparent V magnitude m_V = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the required m_V < 16.\n    *   **Conclusion: Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   DEC = -48°. This is within the observable range for both observatories.\n    *   We need to calculate its apparent magnitude.\n        *   Absolute V magnitude M = 15.5 mag.\n        *   Distance d = 10 pc.\n        *   Extinction A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   This is not brighter than the required m_V < 16.\n    *   **Conclusion: Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   DEC = +60°. This is within the observable range for both observatories.\n    *   We need to calculate its apparent magnitude.\n        *   Absolute V magnitude M = 16.5 mag.\n        *   Distance d = 5 pc.\n        *   Extinction A_V = 0 (since E(B-V) is not given, we assume it's 0).\n        *   m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 + 0 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag.\n    *   This is brighter than the required m_V < 16.\n    *   **Conclusion: Observable by both.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 can be detected by both observatories.\n\n<<<B>>>"
