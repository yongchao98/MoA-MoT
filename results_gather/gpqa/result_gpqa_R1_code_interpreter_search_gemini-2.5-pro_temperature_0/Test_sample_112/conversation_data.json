    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules. It could also be an alcohol, but the other peaks will help differentiate.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is unsaturated.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, which supports the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺):\n        *   Carbon (C): ~12 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O) x 2: ~16 amu * 2 = 32 amu\n        *   Hydrogen (H): ~1 amu\n        *   Total mass = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This fragment provides strong evidence that the molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   The combined data from all three techniques points to a molecule that is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It must contain both a -COOH group and a C=C double bond.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   A carboxylic acid (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond, which accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n    *   A C=C double bond accounts for another **one degree of unsaturation**.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total of **two degrees of unsaturation (DoU = 2)**. It must also contain **two oxygen atoms** to be a carboxylic acid.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each formula. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:** Contains only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. Eliminated.\n*   **B) C6H10O2:** Contains two oxygens. DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement for one C=O and one C=C bond. This is a strong candidate.\n*   **C) C6H12O2:** Contains two oxygens. DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This only accounts for the C=O in the carboxylic acid. It does not have the second degree of unsaturation needed for the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR. Eliminated.\n*   **D) C6H10O:** Contains only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. Eliminated.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2, which represents an unsaturated carboxylic acid with six carbons.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula_str):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for a chemical formula.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    counts = {'C': 0, 'H': 0, 'N': 0, 'O': 0, 'X': 0}\n    # Find all element-count pairs in the formula string\n    for element, count in re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula_str):\n        count = int(count) if count else 1\n        if element == 'C':\n            counts['C'] = count\n        elif element == 'H':\n            counts['H'] = count\n        elif element == 'N':\n            counts['N'] = count\n        elif element == 'O':\n            counts['O'] = count\n        elif element in ['F', 'Cl', 'Br', 'I']:\n            counts['X'] += count\n    \n    # Apply the DoU formula: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2\n    dou = counts['C'] + 1 - (counts['H'] / 2) - (counts['X'] / 2) + (counts['N'] / 2)\n    return int(dou)\n\n# The problem requires a molecule with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and a C=C bond.\n# -COOH group means 2 oxygens and 1 degree of unsaturation (DoU).\n# C=C bond means another 1 degree of unsaturation.\n# Total required DoU = 2.\n# Total required Oxygens = 2.\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"C6H12O\",\n    \"B\": \"C6H10O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C6H12O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C6H10O\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Analysis of Options:\")\nfor option, formula in options.items():\n    oxygens = formula.count('O')\n    if 'O' in formula and not formula[formula.find('O')+1].isdigit():\n        oxygens = 1\n    elif 'O' in formula:\n        oxygens = int(formula[formula.find('O')+1])\n\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    \n    print(f\"Option {option} ({formula}): Oxygens = {oxygens}, DoU = {dou}\")\n    \n    if oxygens != 2:\n        print(\"  - Incorrect: Does not have 2 oxygens for a carboxylic acid.\")\n    elif dou != 2:\n        print(f\"  - Incorrect: DoU is {dou}, but 2 is required for a C=O and a C=C bond.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"  - Correct: Has 2 oxygens and DoU = 2.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "An error occurred in the previous code execution. The method for counting oxygen atoms was flawed and resulted in an `IndexError` for formulas where 'O' was the last character. I will correct this by using a more robust parsing method with regular expressions, similar to the one used in the `calculate_dou` function.\n\nHere is the corrected reasoning and code:\n\n**Reasoning Revisited**\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   Broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹: Characteristic of an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   Strong peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹: Characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Strong peak at ~1650 cm⁻¹: Characteristic of a C=C (alkene) stretch.\n    *   Conclusion from FTIR: The molecule is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   Vinyl-hydrogens observed: This confirms the presence of hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   Fragment at m/z = 45: This is a key piece of evidence. The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is (12.01 for C) + (2 * 16.00 for O) + (1.01 for H) ≈ 45. This strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Structural Requirements:**\n    *   From the analysis, the unknown compound must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **2 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) must account for both the C=O bond in the acid and the C=C bond. Each double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the molecule must have a **DoU of 2**.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   We need to find the formula with **2 oxygen atoms** and a **DoU of 2**.\n    *   The formula for Degree of Unsaturation is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options with a corrected script.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef calculate_dou(formula_str):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for a chemical formula.\"\"\"\n    counts = {'C': 0, 'H': 0}\n    # Find all element-count pairs in the formula string\n    for element, count in re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula_str):\n        count = int(count) if count else 1\n        if element == 'C':\n            counts['C'] = count\n        elif element == 'H':\n            counts['H'] = count\n    \n    # Apply the DoU formula: DoU = C + 1 - H/2\n    dou = counts['C'] + 1 - (counts['H'] / 2)\n    return int(dou)\n\ndef get_element_count(formula_str, element_symbol):\n    \"\"\"Gets the count of a specific element in a chemical formula.\"\"\"\n    # Find the element symbol followed by optional digits\n    match = re.search(element_symbol + r'(\\d*)', formula_str)\n    if not match:\n        return 0\n    # If digits follow, convert them to int. If not, the count is 1.\n    count_str = match.group(1)\n    return int(count_str) if count_str else 1\n\n# Spectroscopic data implies the molecule is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n# - Carboxylic acid (-COOH) requires 2 oxygen atoms and contributes 1 DoU (for the C=O).\n# - Unsaturated (C=C bond) contributes another 1 DoU.\n# - Total requirements: 2 Oxygens, DoU = 2.\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"C6H12O\",\n    \"B\": \"C6H10O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C6H12O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C6H10O\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Analysis of Options based on Spectroscopic Data Requirements (2 Oxygens, DoU = 2):\")\nfor option, formula in options.items():\n    oxygens = get_element_count(formula, 'O')\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    \n    print(f\"Option {option} ({formula}): Oxygens = {oxygens}, DoU = {dou}\")\n    \n    if oxygens == 2 and dou == 2:\n        print(\"  - MATCH: This formula fits all the requirements.\")\n    else:\n        reasons = []\n        if oxygens != 2:\n            reasons.append(\"incorrect number of oxygens\")\n        if dou != 2:\n            reasons.append(\"incorrect degree of unsaturation\")\n        print(f\"  - NO MATCH: Fails due to {', '.join(reasons)}.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "Based on the analysis of the spectroscopic data and the computational verification, here is the final conclusion:\n\n1.  **FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry Summary:** The combined spectroscopic evidence strongly indicates that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The FTIR (broad 3000 cm⁻¹, 1700 cm⁻¹) and Mass Spec (m/z = 45 fragment) confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   The FTIR (1650 cm⁻¹) and ¹H NMR (vinyl hydrogens) confirm the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n2.  **Chemical Formula Requirements:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The structure must have **two degrees of unsaturation (DoU)**: one for the C=O bond in the acid and one for the C=C bond.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of Options:** The code output systematically checked each option against these two requirements:\n    *   **A) C6H12O:** Fails. Only 1 oxygen and DoU = 1.\n    *   **B) C6H10O2:** **Matches.** It has 2 oxygens and a DoU of 2.\n    *   **C) C6H12O2:** Fails. It has 2 oxygens but a DoU of only 1 (which would account for the carboxylic acid but not the C=C bond).\n    *   **D) C6H10O:** Fails. Only 1 oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the experimental evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
