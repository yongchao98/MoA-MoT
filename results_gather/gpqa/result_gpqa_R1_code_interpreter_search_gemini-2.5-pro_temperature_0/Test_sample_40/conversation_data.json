    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame where the observer is located.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame, which is the rest frame of the glass. It moves with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the Glass Frame (S') relative to the Lab Frame (S):** This is given as `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam relative to the Glass Frame (S'):** In any medium with a refractive index `n`, the speed of light is `c/n`. The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`. Therefore, the speed of the light beam as measured within the glass (in frame S') is `u' = 1/n`. Since the beam propagates in the same direction as the glass is moving, this velocity is positive.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    To find the velocity of the light beam as seen by the observer in the laboratory frame (S), we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula. When all velocities are in the same direction, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the lab frame (S), which is what we need to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the moving frame (S').\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the lab frame (S).\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We have:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula gives:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    To simplify the complex fraction, we can find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator.\n    *   Numerator: `1/n + v = 1/n + (n*v)/n = (1 + n*v) / n`\n    *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = n/n + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n\n    Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n    `u = ((1 + n*v) / n) / ((n + v) / n)`\n\n    We can cancel the `n` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) 1\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n    The result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
