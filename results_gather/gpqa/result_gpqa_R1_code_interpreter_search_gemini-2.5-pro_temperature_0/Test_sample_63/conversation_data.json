    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of the Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a mixture of salts and passing the resulting gases through a series of tubes. We can identify the gaseous products and their quantities by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 g, which is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). The problem states the weight of this tube did not change. This implies that no CO₂ (or other acidic gas) was formed during the decomposition. Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper (Cu) reacts with oxygen gas (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight (0.80 g) is equal to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the gas mixture passes through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas C remain. The volume is given at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. The most common inert gas produced in chemical decompositions of nitrogen-containing compounds is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts**\n\nLet's verify our product identification by checking the law of conservation of mass.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂) = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass is exactly equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identified products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are correct and that the original salts A and B are composed only of the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ended up in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen ended up in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen ended up in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe overall molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nTo get all integers, we multiply the ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nThe problem states that the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. This means that the combined chemical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B must correspond to the empirical formula N₄H₈O₅.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are very likely to be ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions (like NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻).\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated from the experimental data. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n\n**Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\n<<<D>>>"
