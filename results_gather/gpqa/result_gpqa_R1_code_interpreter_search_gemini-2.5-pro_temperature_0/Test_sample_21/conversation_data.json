    "The user wants me to complete the following statement:\n\"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n\nTo solve this, I need to analyze the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of oxygen's reactivity in different pH environments.\n\n**Part 1: Thermodynamics (Strength of the oxidant)**\n\nThe strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° value indicates a stronger tendency to be reduced, and thus, a stronger oxidizing agent.\n\nI need to compare the standard reduction potentials for the reduction of oxygen in acidic and basic solutions.\n\n*   **In acidic solution:** The half-reaction is O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l). The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +1.23 V.\n*   **In basic solution:** The half-reaction is O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq). The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +0.40 V.\n\nComparing the two values: +1.23 V (acidic) > +0.40 V (basic).\n\nSince the reduction potential is lower in basic solution, oxygen has a weaker tendency to accept electrons in basic conditions compared to acidic conditions. Therefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\n**Part 2: Kinetics (Reaction speed)**\n\nThe kinetics of a reaction refers to its rate. The reduction of oxygen is a multi-step process involving the transfer of four electrons. This process has a high activation energy, which is why oxygen, despite being a strong oxidant thermodynamically, is often kinetically slow to react.\n\nThe question asks about the reaction speed in acidic solutions. The reduction of oxygen, particularly in processes like corrosion (e.g., rusting of iron), is known to be significantly faster in acidic solutions than in neutral or basic solutions. The presence of H⁺ ions facilitates the reaction pathway, lowering the activation energy for the overall process. For example, the corrosion of iron is much more rapid in acidic environments because the reduction of oxygen (the cathodic reaction) is faster.\n\nTherefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.\n\nThis corresponds to the combination \"weaker – faster\".\n\n<<<A>>>"
