    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Dilution**\n\n*   We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   First, we calculate the initial moles of acetic acid:\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.05 mol/L × 0.020 L = 0.001 moles of CH₃COOH.\n*   This solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. The number of moles of acetic acid does not change, but the total volume does.\n    *   New Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid solution) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L.\n*   Now, we calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid solution that will be titrated:\n    *   New Concentration = Moles / New Volume\n    *   New Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.040 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At any point during the titration before the equivalence point, we have a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), which is formed by the reaction with NaOH.\n*   The pH of a buffer solution is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH])\n*   First, we need the pKa of acetic acid:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted.\n*   The ratio [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] is therefore 25 / 75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, we can plug this into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 + (-0.48)\n    *   pH ≈ 4.25\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   The equivalence point is reached when the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n    *   Moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 moles.\n*   We can find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required:\n    *   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains 0.001 moles of CH₃COO⁻.\n*   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the diluted acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]) is:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   Acetate is a weak base and will react with water (hydrolysis), making the solution basic:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate:\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   We can set up an ICE table to find the [OH⁻] concentration:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, so the equation simplifies to:\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Now, we calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a Python script for the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% titration ---\nKa = 1.85e-5\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at equivalence point ---\n# Initial conditions\nV_acid_initial = 0.020  # L\nC_acid_initial = 0.05   # M\nV_water = 0.020         # L\nC_NaOH = 0.1            # M\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# After dilution\nmoles_acid = C_acid_initial * V_acid_initial\nV_total_initial = V_acid_initial + V_water\n\n# At equivalence point\nV_eq_NaOH = moles_acid / C_NaOH\nV_total_eq = V_total_initial + V_eq_NaOH\nC_acetate_eq = moles_acid / V_total_eq\n\n# Hydrolysis of acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C_acetate_eq)\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * C_acetate_eq)\npOH = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
