    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2, which is `L1 / L2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by `L = 4 * π * R^2 * σ * T^4`, where `R` is the star's radius, `T` is its surface temperature, and `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The peak emission wavelength (`λ_emitted`) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature `T`. The formula is `λ_emitted * T = b`, where `b` is Wien's constant.\n    *   **Relativistic Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the wavelength emitted by the source (`λ_emitted`). The formula depends on the relative velocity `v` between the source and the observer. For a source moving radially, the formula is `λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))`, where `c` is the speed of light. By convention in astronomy, a positive radial velocity indicates the object is moving away (redshift), and a negative velocity indicates it is moving closer (blueshift).\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars:\n    `L1 / L2 = (4 * π * R1^2 * σ * T1^4) / (4 * π * R2^2 * σ * T2^4)`\n    The constants `4`, `π`, and `σ` cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    `L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4`\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information:**\n    *   The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2: `R1 = 1.5 * R2`, so `R1 / R2 = 1.5`.\n    *   The mass information (`M1 = 1.5 * M2`) is not needed for this calculation, as we are assuming the stars are black bodies, for which luminosity depends only on radius and temperature.\n    *   The observed peak wavelengths are the same: `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`.\n    *   The radial velocities are `v1 = 0 km/s` and `v2 = 700 km/s`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T1 / T2):**\n    *   From Wien's Law, `T` is inversely proportional to `λ_emitted`. Therefore, the temperature ratio is `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between the emitted wavelengths using the Doppler effect and the fact that the observed wavelengths are equal.\n    *   For Star_1, `v1 = 0`, so there is no Doppler shift. This means `λ_obs_1 = λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   For Star_2, `v2 = 700 km/s`. Since the velocity is positive, we assume it is moving away from the observer (redshift). The observed wavelength is given by the relativistic Doppler formula: `λ_obs_2 = λ_emitted_2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`.\n    *   Since `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`, we can set the expressions equal:\n        `λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`\n    *   Now, we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths:\n        `λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1 = 1 / sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c)) = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        `T1 / T2 = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for the radius ratio and temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n        `L1 / L2 = (1.5)^2 * [sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))]^4`\n    *   The square root and the power of 4 simplify:\n        `L1 / L2 = (1.5)^2 * ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))^2`\n    *   Now, we plug in the values and compute the result.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we will use a Python script for the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nR_ratio = 1.5  # R1 / R2\nv2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v2/c)\nbeta = v2 / c\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio squared: (T1/T2)^2\n# T1/T2 = sqrt((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))\n# (T1/T2)^4 = ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))^2\ntemp_ratio_term = ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))**2\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio L1/L2\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R_ratio**2) * temp_ratio_term\n\nprint(f\"{luminosity_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n2.2291\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation gives a value of approximately 2.2291. When rounded to two decimal places, this is 2.23. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to determine the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 (`L1 / L2`).\n\n**2. Identify Key Physical Principles**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is `L = 4πR²σT⁴`, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects the surface temperature (T) of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (`λ_emitted`). The formula is `λ_emitted * T = b`, where b is Wien's constant. This implies that `T` is inversely proportional to `λ_emitted`.\n*   **Relativistic Doppler Effect:** This effect describes how the observed wavelength of light (`λ_obs`) changes due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. For an object moving with a radial velocity `v`, the observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength (`λ_emitted`) by the formula: `λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))`, where `c` is the speed of light. A positive `v` indicates the object is moving away (redshift).\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:\n`L1 = 4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴`\n`L2 = 4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴`\n\nThe ratio `L1 / L2` is:\n`L1 / L2 = (4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴) / (4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴)`\n\nThe constants `4π` and `σ` cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n`L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`\n\n**4. Determine the Radius and Temperature Ratios**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio (`R1 / R2`):**\n    The problem states that `R1 = 1.5 * R2`. Therefore, `R1 / R2 = 1.5`.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio (`T1 / T2`):**\n    From Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength (`T ∝ 1/λ_emitted`). So, the temperature ratio is `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1`.\n    We need to find the ratio of the *emitted* wavelengths. We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`.\n\n    *   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity `v1 = 0`. With no velocity, there is no Doppler shift. Thus, `λ_obs_1 = λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity `v2 = 700 km/s`. This star is moving, so its light is Doppler shifted.\n        `λ_obs_2 = λ_emitted_2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`\n\n    Since `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`, we can set the expressions equal:\n    `λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for our temperature calculation:\n    `λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1 = 1 / sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c)) = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`\n\n    Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    `T1 / T2 = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\nSubstitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into our main equation:\n`L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))]⁴`\n\nThe square root and the power of 4 simplify:\n`L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))²`\n\nNow, we plug in the numerical values:\n*   `R1 / R2 = 1.5`\n*   `v2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s`\n*   `c ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s`\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python script was:\n`L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * ((1 - 700000/299792458) / (1 + 700000/299792458))²`\n`L1 / L2 ≈ 2.25 * (0.9907)`\n`L1 / L2 ≈ 2.2291`\n\nRounding this result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
