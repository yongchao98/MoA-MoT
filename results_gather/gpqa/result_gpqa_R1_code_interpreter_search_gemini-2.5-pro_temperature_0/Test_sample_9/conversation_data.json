    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the concept of density in planets:** Density is defined as mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). For a spherical planet, the volume is (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius. The density of a planet depends on its composition (what it's made of) and the degree of compression due to its own gravity.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each option:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our reference point. Earth has an average density of approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this ρ_Earth.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given directly and is approximately the same as Earth's density.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet is a \"Super-Earth\". Because it has the same composition as Earth, the building blocks are the same (e.g., iron, silicates). However, since it is 5 times more massive, its gravitational force is much stronger. This intense gravity will compress the materials more tightly than they are compressed within Earth. Increased compression means the same amount of material occupies less space, which results in a higher overall density. Therefore, this planet's density will be significantly greater than Earth's density.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This is a \"sub-Earth\". Following the same logic as in (c), this planet has less mass and therefore weaker gravity than Earth. The materials will be less compressed. Consequently, its density will be lower than Earth's density.\n\n3.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density(c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to greater gravitational compression)\n    *   Density(d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lesser gravitational compression)\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the options, the planet described in option (c) is the most massive one with a composition identical to Earth's. The principle of gravitational compression dictates that it must be the densest among the choices.\n\nTo provide a quantitative estimate, we can use the approximate mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, R ∝ M^(~0.25).\n\n*   For planet (c), M_c = 5 * M_Earth. Its density ρ_c would be approximately 5^(1/4) times Earth's density.\n    *   ρ_c ≈ (1.5) * ρ_Earth ≈ 1.5 * 5.51 g/cm³ ≈ 8.3 g/cm³.\n*   For planet (d), M_d = 0.5 * M_Earth. Its density ρ_d would be approximately 0.5^(1/4) times Earth's density.\n    *   ρ_d ≈ (0.84) * ρ_Earth ≈ 0.84 * 5.51 g/cm³ ≈ 4.6 g/cm³.\n\nThis calculation confirms the qualitative reasoning. The planet in option (c) has the highest density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
