    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Nature of the Energy Spectrum\n\nThe energy spectrum of a particle emitted in a decay depends on the number of particles in the final state.\n\n*   **Two-body decay (e.g., A -> B + C):** In the rest frame of particle A, the laws of conservation of energy and momentum completely determine the energies of the outgoing particles B and C. This results in a **discrete** energy spectrum, meaning the particles are always emitted with the same specific energy.\n\n*   **Three-or-more-body decay (e.g., A -> B + C + D):** When there are three or more particles in the final state, the total energy released (the Q-value) can be distributed among them in a continuous range of ways while still conserving energy and momentum. This results in a **continuous** energy spectrum for each particle, ranging from zero up to a maximum value (the endpoint).\n\nLet's apply this to the decays in the question:\n\n*   **Original Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`\n    The final state consists of six particles (two B, two E, two V). Since this is a multi-body decay (more than two particles), the energy shared among the light particles (2E and 2V) is distributed continuously. Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the two E particles is **continuous**.\n\n*   **Variant Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`\n    The final state consists of five particles (two B, two E, one M). This is also a multi-body decay. The energy is shared among the light particles (2E and M) in a continuous manner. Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the two E particles remains **continuous**.\n\n**Conclusion on Spectrum Shape:** The spectrum remains continuous. This eliminates options A and C. The shape of the continuous spectrum will be different (\"adjusted\") because the number of particles sharing the energy has changed (from 2E+2V to 2E+M), which alters the available phase space.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Endpoint of the Spectrum\n\nThe endpoint of the energy spectrum represents the maximum possible kinetic energy that the particle(s) of interest (the two E particles combined) can have. This maximum energy is equal to the total energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value.\n\nThe Q-value is determined by the difference in rest mass between the initial and final states, according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, `E = mc^2`.\n\n`Q-value = (Total Mass_initial - Total Mass_final) * c^2`\n\nLet's calculate the Q-value for both decays. Let `M_A`, `M_B`, `m_E`, `m_V`, and `m_M` be the rest masses of the respective particles.\n\n*   **Q-value of Original Decay (Q₁):**\n    `Mass_initial = 2 * M_A`\n    `Mass_final_1 = 2 * M_B + 2 * m_E + 2 * m_V`\n    `Q₁ = (2*M_A - (2*M_B + 2*m_E + 2*m_V)) * c^2`\n\n*   **Q-value of Variant Decay (Q₂):**\n    `Mass_initial = 2 * M_A`\n    `Mass_final_2 = 2 * M_B + 2 * m_E + m_M`\n    `Q₂ = (2*M_A - (2*M_B + 2*m_E + m_M)) * c^2`\n\nNow, let's compare `Q₁` and `Q₂`. The problem states that particle `M` is **massless** (`m_M = 0`). Particle `V` is a standard particle (like a neutrino), which has a small but non-zero mass (`m_V > 0`).\n\nComparing the final masses:\n`Mass_final_1 = 2*M_B + 2*m_E + 2*m_V`\n`Mass_final_2 = 2*M_B + 2*m_E + 0`\n\nSince `m_V > 0`, it is clear that `Mass_final_1 > Mass_final_2`.\n\nThe decay with the smaller final mass will have a larger Q-value (more mass is converted into energy). Therefore, `Q₂ > Q₁`.\n\n**Conclusion on Endpoint:** Since the endpoint of the E-particle energy spectrum is determined by the Q-value, and `Q₂ > Q₁`, the endpoint of the spectrum for the variant decay is **higher** than for the original decay.\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nCombining our findings:\n1.  The spectrum remains **continuous** (with an adjusted shape).\n2.  The endpoint **increases**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
