    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Define the Pauli Matrices and the Operator**\n\nThe problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ which are proportional to the Pauli matrices:\n-   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n-   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n-   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\nThis operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, often denoted as $\\vec{S}$.\n\n**2. Define the Direction Vector**\n\nThe problem states that the direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in spherical coordinates is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$.\nFor the vector to be in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This occurs when $\\phi=0$.\nTherefore, the unit direction vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n**3. Construct the Operator along the Direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator for the spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$, denoted as $P_n$, is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\nSubstituting the components:\n$P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x) \\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y) (0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z) \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, substitute the matrix representations:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 1 \\cdot \\cos\\theta & 1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta \\\\ 1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta & 0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta - 1 \\cdot \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$b = a \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nUsing the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n$1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n$\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for $b$:\n$b = a \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo the eigenvector has the form $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**5. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nTo simplify the form and normalize it, we can choose a convenient value for $a$. Let's set $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\nThen, $b = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n\nThe eigenvector is then $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNow, we check if this vector is normalized. The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components:\n$||\\psi||^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\nThe vector is already normalized.\n\nThus, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect.\nB) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect.\nC) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect.\nD) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Correct.\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
