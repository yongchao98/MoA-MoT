    "My thinking process to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Crystal System and Given Parameters:** The problem specifies a rhombohedral crystal. The given parameters are:\n    *   Lattice parameter `a` (interatomic distance) = 10 Angstrom.\n    *   Interaxial angles `α = β = γ` = 30°.\n    *   The plane of interest is (hkl) = (111).\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Interplanar Spacing:** I need the formula for the interplanar distance, `d_hkl`, for a rhombohedral lattice. The general formula for a triclinic system is quite complex, but it simplifies for higher symmetry systems. For a rhombohedral system (`a = b = c`, `α = β = γ`), the formula is:\n    `1/d_hkl^2 = ((h^2 + k^2 + l^2)sin^2(α) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos^2(α) - cos(α))) / (a^2(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α)))`\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for the Specific (111) Plane:** The problem asks for the `d` spacing of the (111) plane. This is a special case where `h = k = l = 1`. I can substitute these values into the formula to simplify it before plugging in the numerical values for `a` and `α`.\n    *   `h = 1, k = 1, l = 1`\n    *   `h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3`\n    *   `hk + kl + lh = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3`\n\n    Substituting these into the numerator:\n    Numerator = `(3)sin^2(α) + 2(3)(cos^2(α) - cos(α))`\n    = `3sin^2(α) + 6cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\n    Using the identity `sin^2(α) = 1 - cos^2(α)`:\n    = `3(1 - cos^2(α)) + 6cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\n    = `3 - 3cos^2(α) + 6cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\n    = `3 + 3cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\n    = `3 * (1 - 2cos(α) + cos^2(α))`\n    = `3 * (1 - cos(α))^2`\n\n    Now, let's look at the denominator term `(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α))`. This expression can be factored into `(1 + 2cos(α))(1 - cos(α))^2`.\n\n    Now, assemble the simplified `1/d_111^2` formula:\n    `1/d_111^2 = (3 * (1 - cos(α))^2) / (a^2 * (1 + 2cos(α))(1 - cos(α))^2)`\n\n    The `(1 - cos(α))^2` term cancels out from the numerator and denominator, leaving a much simpler expression:\n    `1/d_111^2 = 3 / (a^2 * (1 + 2cos(α)))`\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** Now I have a simple formula. I can plug in the given values:\n    *   `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   `α = 30°`\n    *   `cos(30°) = sqrt(3) / 2`\n\n    Substitute these into the simplified formula:\n    `1/d_111^2 = 3 / (10^2 * (1 + 2 * (sqrt(3) / 2)))`\n    `1/d_111^2 = 3 / (100 * (1 + sqrt(3)))`\n\n    Now, solve for `d_111`:\n    `d_111^2 = (100 * (1 + sqrt(3))) / 3`\n    `d_111 = sqrt((100 * (1 + sqrt(3))) / 3)`\n    `d_111 = 10 * sqrt((1 + sqrt(3)) / 3)`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Numerical Value:** To get the final answer and compare it with the options, I will use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30.0  # degrees\n\n# Convert angle to radians for use in trigonometric functions\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Calculate cos(alpha)\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n\n# Use the simplified formula for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral lattice:\n# d^2 = (a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(alpha))) / 3\nd_squared = (a**2 * (1 + 2 * cos_alpha)) / 3\n\n# Calculate the interplanar distance d by taking the square root\nd = math.sqrt(d_squared)\n\nprint(d)\n```\n```output\n9.54295191958638\n```\nThe calculated value is approximately 9.543 Angstrom. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 10.05 Angstrom\nB) 9.54 Angstrom\nC) 9.08 Angstrom\nD) 8.95 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a problem about the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n**1.

Recall the relevant formula:**\nFor a rhombohedral crystal system, the formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` is given by:\n\n`1/d_hkl^2 = ((h^2 + k^2 + l^2)sin^2(α) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos^2(α) - cos(α))) / (a^2(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α)))`\n\n**3. Simplify the formula for the (111) plane:**\nFor the (111) plane, we have `h = 1`, `k = 1`, and `l = 1`.\nLet's substitute these values into the formula:\n*   `h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nNow, substitute these into the numerator of the formula:\nNumerator = `3sin^2(α) + 2(3)(cos^2(α) - cos(α))`\n= `3sin^2(α) + 6cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\nUsing the trigonometric identity `sin^2(α) = 1 - cos^2(α)`:\n= `3(1 - cos^2(α)) + 6cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\n= `3 - 3cos^2(α) + 6cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\n= `3 + 3cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\n= `3(1 - 2cos(α) + cos^2(α))`\nThis is a perfect square:\n= `3(1 - cos(α))^2`\n\nNow, let's look at the term in the denominator: `(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α))`.\nThis can be factored as `(1 + 2cos(α))(1 - cos(α))^2`.\n\nSo, the full expression for `1/d_111^2` becomes:\n`1/d_111^2 = (3(1 - cos(α))^2) / (a^2(1 + 2cos(α))(1 - cos(α))^2)`\n\nWe can cancel the `(1 - cos(α))^2` term from the numerator and the denominator, which greatly simplifies the formula:\n`1/d_111^2 = 3 / (a^2(1 + 2cos(α)))`\n\n**4. Perform the calculation:**\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`\n*   `cos(30°) = sqrt(3) / 2`\n\n`1/d_111^2 = 3 / (10^2 * (1 + 2 * (sqrt(3)/2)))`\n`1/d_111^2 = 3 / (100 * (1 + sqrt(3)))`\n\nNow, we solve for `d_111`:\n`d_111^2 = (100 * (1 + sqrt(3))) / 3`\n`d_111 = sqrt((100 * (1 + sqrt(3))) / 3)`\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt((1 + sqrt(3)) / 3)`\n\n**5.
