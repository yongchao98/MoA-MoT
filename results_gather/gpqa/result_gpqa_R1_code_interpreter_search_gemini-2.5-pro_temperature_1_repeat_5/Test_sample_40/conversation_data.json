    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the frame of the observer, which is considered stationary.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame moving with the glass. The glass is at rest in this frame.\n\n2.  **Determine the Velocities in Each Frame:**\n    *   **Speed of light in the glass frame (S'):** The refractive index `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`).\n        *   `n = c / u'`\n        *   The problem states that `c = 1`.\n        *   Therefore, the speed of light as measured by an observer moving with the glass is `u' = 1 / n`. This velocity is in the same direction as the motion of the glass.\n\n    *   **Speed of the glass frame (S') relative to the laboratory frame (S):** The glass is moving at a constant velocity `v` in the same direction as the light beam.\n        *   So, the velocity of the S' frame relative to the S frame is `v`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    *   According to classical (Galilean) relativity, one would simply add the velocities: `u = u' + v`. However, this is incorrect for speeds approaching the speed of light.\n    *   We must use Einstein's relativistic velocity addition formula, which correctly describes how velocities add up in special relativity. The formula is:\n        `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    *   Here, `u` is the speed of the light beam as observed in the laboratory frame (S).\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    *   We have:\n        *   `u' = 1/n`\n        *   `v = v`\n        *   `c = 1`\n    *   Substituting these into the formula:\n        `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n    *   To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can find a common denominator for the numerator and the denominator.\n        *   Numerator: `(1/n) + v = (1 + n*v) / n`\n        *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n    *   Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n        `u = ( (1 + n*v) / n ) / ( (n + v) / n )`\n    *   The `n` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out.\n        `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    *   This matches option (C).\n\nA) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\nB) 1\nC) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nD) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
