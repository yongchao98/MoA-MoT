    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Input Data:** Let's break down the key experimental observations provided.\n    *   **Compound:** A chemically synthesized small peptide. Peptides are chains of amino acids linked by amide bonds. Amino acids (except glycine) are chiral.\n    *   **¹H NMR Observation:** The spectrum for a specific alpha-proton (a proton on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group of an amino acid) shows two distinct peaks.\n        *   The total area (integral) of these two peaks adds up to one proton (1H).\n        *   The individual integrals of the two peaks are roughly equal.\n        *   This means the sample contains two different species, in a roughly 1:1 ratio, and in both species, there is an alpha-proton in a slightly different chemical environment.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, meaning the splitting is not due to adjacent protons.\n    *   **LC-MS Observation:**\n        *   The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates the crude mixture into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different compounds in a 1:1 ratio that can be separated based on their physical properties (interaction with the chromatography column).\n        *   The Mass Spectrometry (MS) analysis shows that both of these separated peaks have the exact same mass.\n        *   This mass corresponds to the expected mass of the target peptide molecule.\n        *   This tells us the two species are isomers – they have the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms.\n        *   The analysis was done at an \"elevated temperature,\" and the peaks are still \"clearly defined,\" which suggests the two species are stable and do not easily interconvert under these conditions.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties (except for their interaction with polarized light).\n        *   In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and on a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single set of peaks in the NMR and a single peak in the LC.\n        *   This option contradicts both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor is a molecule used in an earlier step of the synthesis. It would almost certainly have a different chemical structure and therefore a different molecular weight.\n        *   The MS data clearly shows both separated components have the *same mass* as the final product, not a different mass corresponding to a precursor.\n        *   This option contradicts the MS data.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This is not a standard chemical term. If it implies an accidental addition of an extra amino acid, for instance, the resulting molecule would have a significantly different (higher) mass.\n        *   This option contradicts the MS data, which shows the mass is correct for the expected molecule.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. A common example in peptides is epimerization at one alpha-carbon (e.g., a mix of L-Ala-L-Val and D-Ala-L-Val) or *cis/trans* isomerism about the amide bond.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Diastereoisomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties. They will have different NMR spectra. It is very common for a mixture of diastereomers to show two sets of peaks for protons, especially those near the point of isomerism (like an alpha-proton). The observation of two peaks for the same proton is perfectly explained.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) LC. The observation of two LC peaks is expected. Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass. The observation that both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum is also perfectly explained.\n        *   Therefore, this option is consistent with all the experimental data provided. The two species are isomers (same mass) that are not enantiomers (separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR). This is the definition of diastereomers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of two NMR signals for a single proton and two separable LC peaks with identical mass is the classic signature of a sample containing a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
