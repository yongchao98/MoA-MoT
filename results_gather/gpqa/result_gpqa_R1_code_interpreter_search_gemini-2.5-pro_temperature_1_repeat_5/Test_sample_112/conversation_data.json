    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating that the molecule is an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these signals in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, which corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n    *   The observation of a fragment at m/z = 45 is strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group, which readily fragments to form the stable [COOH]⁺ cation.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Information and Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   From the combined data, we can conclude that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This allows us to immediately eliminate options A (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are now left with two possibilities: B (C₆H₁₀O₂) and C (C₆H₁₂O₂).\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE). The formula for a compound with C carbons and H hydrogens is: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1.\n    *   Our structural analysis showed the presence of one C=C double bond (1 degree of unsaturation) and one C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid group (1 degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the total DoU for the molecule must be 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   For **B) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**.\n        *   For **C) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**.\n    *   The calculated DoU for C₆H₁₀O₂ is 2, which perfectly matches the structural features identified from the spectra (one C=C and one C=O). The DoU for C₆H₁₂O₂ is 1, which would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid), contradicting the evidence for a C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>"
