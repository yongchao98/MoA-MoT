    "The user is asking to interpret a piece of slang used by synthetic organic chemists. The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" describes a problem encountered during the purification of a chemical reaction mixture.\n\n1.  **Analyze the context:** The setting is a synthetic organic chemistry lab. A key activity in such a lab is synthesis, which involves a chemical reaction to create a desired product, followed by purification, which is the process of separating the desired product from unreacted starting materials, byproducts, and solvents.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the phrase:** \"On top of each other\" is a metaphorical way of saying that two or more things are occupying the same space and are difficult to distinguish or separate. In the context of chemical purification, this means the compounds are behaving identically under the chosen separation conditions.\n\n3.  **Consider the common separation techniques and the options provided:**\n    *   **Distillation:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their boiling points. If compounds have very similar boiling points (Option A), they will boil and distill at nearly the same temperature, making them difficult to separate. This is a possible interpretation.\n    *   **Chromatography (e.g., Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) or Column Chromatography):** This is arguably the most common purification technique in a modern synthetic organic chemistry lab. It separates compounds based on their differential affinity for a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent or solvent mixture). This affinity is primarily determined by the compound's **polarity**.\n        *   Chemists often first analyze their reaction mixture using TLC. On a TLC plate, compounds appear as spots. If two compounds have very similar polarities (Option D), they will travel up the plate at the same rate, and their spots will appear at the same positionâ€”literally \"on top of each other.\"\n        *   When scaling up the purification to a column, if compounds have similar polarities, they will travel down the column together and elute at the same time, making separation impossible. This is frequently described as the compounds \"running on top of each other.\" This phrasing is a very common and direct description of a failed chromatographic separation.\n\n    *   **Non-covalent interactions (Option B):** While these forces (like polarity and hydrogen bonding) are the underlying reason for the physical properties used in separation (like boiling point and chromatographic behavior), just stating that the compounds are interacting is too general. It doesn't pinpoint the specific separation problem. The phrase \"on top of each other\" refers to the *outcome* of a separation attempt, not the fundamental intermolecular forces themselves.\n\n    *   **Optical Rotation (Option C):** Optical rotation is a physical property used to characterize chiral molecules, not a basis for common separation techniques like distillation or chromatography. While separating molecules with similar optical rotations might be a goal, their separability depends on other properties like polarity or boiling point. Therefore, this is an unlikely meaning.\n\n4.  **Compare the best options (A vs. D):** Both similar boiling points (A) and similar polarities (D) lead to separation difficulties. However, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is a much more common and direct idiom for a failed chromatographic separation (based on polarity) than for a failed distillation. The visual of two spots overlapping on a TLC plate makes the metaphor particularly apt. Given the ubiquity of chromatography in synthetic labs, this is the most probable meaning.\n\n<<<D>>>"
