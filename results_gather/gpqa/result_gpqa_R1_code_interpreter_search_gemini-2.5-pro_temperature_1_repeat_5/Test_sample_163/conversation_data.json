    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). This can be expressed as the factor M1/M2.\n\n2.  **Extract Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star A (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star B (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star A (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star B (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Identify the Physical Principles:** The problem involves double-lined spectroscopic binaries, meaning we can observe the spectral lines from both stars and measure their radial velocities. The key relationship connecting the observables (Period P, and radial velocity semi-amplitudes K1 and K2) to the total mass of the system (M = m1 + m2) is given by Kepler's Third Law, expressed in terms of these spectroscopic quantities:\n\n    (m1 + m2) * sin³(i) = [P / (2πG)] * (K1 + K2)³\n\n    Where:\n    *   m1, m2 are the masses of the two stars.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   K1, K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for the two stars.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Use the Information about Eclipses:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. For an eclipse to occur, the orbital plane must be very close to our line of sight. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin³(i) = 1. This simplifies the mass equation significantly:\n\n    M_total = m1 + m2 = [P / (2πG)] * (K1 + K2)³\n\n5.  **Calculate the Sum of Radial Velocity Amplitudes:**\n    *   For System 1: K1_total = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s.\n    *   For System 2: K2_total = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s.\n\n6.  **Form the Ratio of the Masses:** We need to find M1 / M2. We can write the expressions for M1 and M2 and then divide them.\n\n    M1 = [P1 / (2πG)] * (K1_total)³\n    M2 = [P2 / (2πG)] * (K2_total)³\n\n    M1 / M2 = { [P1 / (2πG)] * (K1_total)³ } / { [P2 / (2πG)] * (K2_total)³ }\n\n    The constant term `1 / (2πG)` cancels out, leaving:\n\n    M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)³\n\n7.  **Substitute the values and compute the ratio:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K1_total = 15 km/s\n    *   K2_total = 25 km/s\n\n    Note that since we are taking a ratio, we don't need to convert the units to a standard system (like SI units) as long as they are consistent for both systems. The conversion factors would cancel out.\n\n    M1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n\n8.  **Calculate the final numerical value:** To find the decimal value, we can perform the division. A simple way is to multiply the numerator and denominator by 8 to get a denominator of 1000.\n\n    M1 / M2 = (54 * 8) / (125 * 8) = 432 / 1000 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\nI will use Python to confirm the calculation.\n```python\n# Parameters for System 1\nP1 = 2.0  # Period in years\nK1_total = 10.0 + 5.0  # Sum of radial velocity amplitudes in km/s\n\n# Parameters for System 2\nP2 = 1.0  # Period in years\nK2_total = 15.0 + 10.0  # Sum of radial velocity amplitudes in km/s\n\n# The ratio of total masses M1/M2 is given by (P1/P2) * (K1_total/K2_total)^3\n# The constants and unit conversions cancel out in the ratio.\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation confirms that the ratio M1/M2 is 0.432. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 1.2\nB) ~ 0.7\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.6\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and the output is `0.432`.\n\nHere is a summary of the reasoning:\n1.  The total mass (M) of an eclipsing binary system is related to its orbital period (P) and the sum of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of its stars (K_total = K1 + K2). The relationship derived from Kepler's Third Law for an eclipsing system (where the inclination i ≈ 90° and sin(i) ≈ 1) is:\n    M ∝ P * (K_total)³\n\n2.  We want to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2). We can set up the ratio as follows:\n    M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1_total)³] / [P2 * (K2_total)³]\n\n3.  From the problem statement, we have:\n    *   For system_1: P1 = 2 years, K1_total = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s.\n    *   For system_2: P2 = 1 year, K2_total = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s.\n\n4.  Plugging these values into the ratio equation:\n    M1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216\n    M1 / M2 = 0.432\n\n5.  The calculated ratio is 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~ 1.2\n    B) ~ 0.7\n    C) ~ 0.4\n    D) ~ 0.6\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
