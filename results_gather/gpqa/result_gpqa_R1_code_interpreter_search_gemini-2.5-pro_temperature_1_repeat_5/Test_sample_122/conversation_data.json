    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame from which we want to measure the distance. The center of the Galaxy is at rest in this frame.\n    *   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame. The time given (50 seconds) is measured in this frame, making it the \"proper time\" (Δt₀ or Δt').\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Values:**\n    *   Relative velocity (v): The ejecta moves at 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy.\n    *   Proper time (Δt₀): The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is 50 s.\n    *   Speed of light (c): We will use the standard approximation c = 300,000 km/s. The given velocity is a round number, suggesting this approximation is intended.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    Special relativity tells us that time passes slower for a moving object when measured by a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The time elapsed in the stationary frame (Galaxy's frame, Δt) is related to the time elapsed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame, Δt₀) by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\n    The formula for time dilation is:\n    Δt = γ * Δt₀\n\n    Where the Lorentz factor (γ) is calculated as:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio v/c:\n        v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        (v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √0.96) * 50 s\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity (v) multiplied by the time elapsed in that same frame (Δt).\n    *   d = v * Δt\n    *   d = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / √0.96) * 50 s]\n    *   d = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96 km\n    *   d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    To get the numerical answer, we need to calculate the value of 3,000,000 / √0.96. I will use a python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndelta_t0 = 50  # proper time in seconds\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n>>>\n3061862.1784786724\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. This value is very close to option A.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) 3,060,000 km\nB) 2,940,000 km\nC) 2,880,000 km\nD) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe calculated result of 3,061,862 km is closest to 3,060,000 km. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's intended answer.\n\nAnother way to think about the problem is through **Length Contraction**. From the ejecta's frame, the distance to a certain point in the Galaxy would appear contracted. However, the question asks for the distance traveled *in the Galaxy frame*, which points to using time dilation to find the time in the Galaxy frame and then calculating the distance. Our approach is correct.\n\nThe distance without considering relativistic effects would be d = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km (Option D). Since time dilates, the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame is longer than 50s, so the distance traveled must be greater than 3,000,000 km. This eliminates options B, C, and D, leaving only A.\n\nFinal confirmation of the calculation: 3,000,000 / √0.96 ≈ 3,061,862. This confirms that A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference:**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is considered the stationary frame of reference. We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in this frame.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference. The time elapsed in this frame is given as 50 seconds. This is the \"proper time\" (Δt₀).\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\n*   Relative velocity (v) = 60,000 km/s\n*   Proper time (Δt₀) = 50 s\n*   Speed of light (c) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n\n**3. Apply the Time Dilation Formula:**\nAn observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly in the moving frame (the ejecta). The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) is related to the proper time in the ejecta's frame (Δt₀) by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\nWhere the Lorentz factor, γ, is calculated as:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n*   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n*   Now, calculate γ:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n**5. Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n*   Now we can find the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √0.96) * 50 s`\n\n**6. Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame:**\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity (v) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).\n\n*   `Distance = v * Δt`\n*   `Distance = 60,000 km/s * (1 / √0.96) * 50 s`\n*   `Distance = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96`\n*   `Distance = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km`\n\nUsing the provided code output for the calculation: `3,000,000 / √0.96 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n**7. Compare with Options:**\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 2,940,000 km\n*   C) 2,880,000 km\n*   D) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is closest to option A.\n\n**Sanity Check:**\nWithout relativity, the distance would be `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option D). Due to time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame is *longer* than 50 seconds. Therefore, the distance traveled must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km. This eliminates options B, C, and D, leaving A as the only logical answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
