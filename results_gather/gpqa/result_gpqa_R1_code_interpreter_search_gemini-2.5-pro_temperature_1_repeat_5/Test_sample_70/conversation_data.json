    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2, which can be written as T_eq(4) / T_eq(2).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   There are five planets in a system.\n    *   The orbits are circular.\n    *   The planets have the same albedo (A).\n    *   They orbit the same star.\n    *   The orbital periods (P) are in a ratio P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n\n3.  **Recall the Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's properties (its temperature T_star and radius R_star), the planet's albedo (A), and its distance from the star (semi-major axis `a`). The formula is:\n        T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n        This can be simplified to show the proportionality: T_eq ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) / sqrt(a).\n\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects a planet's orbital period (P) with its semi-major axis (`a`). For planets orbiting the same star, the law states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n        P² ∝ a³\n        This can be rewritten as a ∝ P^(2/3).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio:** I need to find the ratio T_eq(4) / T_eq(2).\n    *   T_eq(4) = [Constant] * (1 - A_4)^(1/4) / sqrt(a_4)\n    *   T_eq(2) = [Constant] * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) / sqrt(a_2)\n\n    The [Constant] term includes the star's properties (T_star, R_star) and is the same for both planets. I am given that the albedos are the same (A_4 = A_2). Therefore, the constant and albedo terms will cancel out when I take the ratio:\n\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (1 / sqrt(a_4)) / (1 / sqrt(a_2))\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)\n\n5.  **Connect Temperature Ratio with Period Ratio:**\n    *   From Step 4, I know the temperature ratio depends on the ratio of the semi-major axes (a_2 / a_4).\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law in Step 3, I know how the semi-major axis relates to the orbital period: a ∝ P^(2/3).\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes can be expressed in terms of the periods:\n        a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:** Now I can substitute the expression for (a_2 / a_4) back into my temperature ratio equation:\n\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = sqrt( (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) )\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = ( (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) )^(1/2)\n    *Using the power rule (x^m)^n = x^(m*n)*\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   From the given period ratios, P_2 corresponds to a value of 2, and P_4 corresponds to a value of 3.5.\n    *   The period ratio P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5.\n    *   Substitute this into the final simplified equation:\n        T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\n    I will use a calculator to compute the numerical value.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the period ratio.\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n>\n> 0.8298717902409059\n>\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value is approximately 0.8299.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) ~0.57\n    B) ~0.69\n    C) ~0.75\n    D) ~0.83\n\n    The calculated value is closest to 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody, balancing the energy it receives from its star with the energy it radiates. The energy received from the star is proportional to `1/d²`, where `d` is the distance from the star. The energy radiated by the planet is proportional to `T_eq⁴` (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law).\n    For energy balance: `T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/d²`\n    Taking the fourth root of both sides gives: `T_eq ∝ 1/√d` or `T_eq ∝ d⁻⁰.⁵`.\n    The problem states the albedo is the same for all planets, so it does not affect the *ratio* of their temperatures.\n\n2.  **Understand the Relationship between Orbital Distance and Orbital Period (Kepler's Third Law):**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (d, for a circular orbit).\n    `P² ∝ d³`\n    We can rearrange this to express distance in terms of the period: `d ∝ P²/³`.\n\n3.  **Combine the Relationships:**\n    Now we can substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law into our temperature equation:\n    Since `T_eq ∝ 1/√d` and `d ∝ P²/³`, we get:\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P²/³)`\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / P⁽²/³⁾*⁽¹/²⁾`\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / P¹/³`\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio:**\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`). Using the proportionality we just derived:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1 / P₄¹/³) / (1 / P₂¹/³)`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = P₂¹/³ / P₄¹/³`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)¹/³`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we can take the ratio values for P₂ and P₄:\n    *   P₂ = 2\n    *   P₄ = 3.5\n    Now, substitute these values into our final equation:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹/³`\n\n    To get the final decimal value, we can compute this using a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the orbital periods for Planet 2 and Planet 4\nperiod_ratio_P2_over_P4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is the cube root of the period ratio (P2/P4).\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio_P2_over_P4**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.8298, which rounds to 0.83. Comparing this to the options:\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.69\nC) ~0.75\nD) ~0.83\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
