    "Here's a breakdown of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n**Optical Isomerism**\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are:\n1.  The presence of a **chiral center** (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups).\n2.  The presence of **axial chirality**, where rotation around a bond is restricted, leading to a structure that lacks a plane of symmetry (e.g., atropisomerism in biphenyls).\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The positions ortho to the connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). These bulky groups sterically hinder each other, preventing free rotation around the single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the rings to be twisted out of the same plane. In this twisted, non-planar conformation, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and will show optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral. Therefore, it will show optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C₆H₅)₂CO. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is **achiral**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with a *trans* arrangement across the double bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is **achiral**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
