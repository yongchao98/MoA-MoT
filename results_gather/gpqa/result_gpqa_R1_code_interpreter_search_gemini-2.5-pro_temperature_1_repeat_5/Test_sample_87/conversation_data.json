    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the experimental setup and observations.**\n    *   **Antigen Delivery:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (the antigen) tagged with GFP are delivered orally to mice.\n    *   **Antigen Trafficking:** The proteins travel through the GI tract, with some loss, and eventually reach Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut. The fluorescence in the Peyer's patches confirms the antigen has reached its target immune tissue.\n    *   **Cellular Response:** Inside the Peyer's patches, a specific cell population is observed to be \"proliferating.\" Proliferation (clonal expansion) is a hallmark of an adaptive immune response, where lymphocytes that recognize the antigen are stimulated to divide rapidly.\n    *   **Genetic Analysis:** The \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these proliferating cells is sequenced. The key finding is \"high variability\" in these gene sequences. The variable heavy chain gene is part of the B cell receptor (BCR) and the antibodies it will eventually secrete.\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate the provided options based on the observations.**\n    *   **A) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, which determines the antibody isotype (e.g., IgM, IgG, IgA). It does *not* alter the *variable* region, which is responsible for antigen binding. Therefore, CSR does not explain the observed variability in the *variable* region.\n    *   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow during B cell development, *before* the B cell encounters an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure. While VDJ recombination creates diversity, it's not the process occurring in this proliferating, antigen-specific population to generate *further* variability.\n    *   **C) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, involving a cascade of serum proteins. It is not related to the genetic modification of B cell receptor genes.\n    *   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs specifically in activated B cells that are proliferating in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) following antigen stimulation. SHM introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable region genes (including the heavy chain). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. Those with higher affinity for the antigen are then selected to survive and differentiate further (a process called affinity maturation). This process directly accounts for the \"high variability\" observed in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of the \"proliferating cell population\" in the Peyer's patch.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude the most likely process.**\n    The scenario perfectly describes the events within a germinal center reaction in a Peyer's patch. The proliferating cells are B cells undergoing clonal expansion, and the high variability in their variable heavy chain genes is the direct result of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
