    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Particle Decay:**\n    The decay of unstable particles is governed by an exponential law. The number of particles `N` remaining at a time `t` from an initial population `N₀` is given by:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t_proper / τ₀)`\n    where `τ₀` is the *proper mean lifetime* (the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame) and `t_proper` is the time elapsed in that frame.\n\n2.  **Apply Special Relativity (Time Dilation):**\n    The particles are moving at relativistic speeds relative to the detector (the lab frame). Due to time dilation, the time `t_lab` measured in the lab frame is longer than the time `t_proper` measured in the particle's frame. The relationship is:\n    `t_lab = γ * t_proper`\n    where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is given by `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n    Rearranging, `t_proper = t_lab / γ`. Substituting this into the decay equation, we get the decay law in the lab frame:\n    `N(t_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time of Flight:**\n    The particles are produced at the center and travel a distance `R` (the detector's radius) to reach the inner wall. The time this takes in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`.\n    The problem states the particles have \"ultra-relativistic velocities,\" which means their speed `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. Therefore, we can make the excellent approximation `v ≈ c`.\n    So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Survival Fraction Equation:**\n    The fraction of particles, `f`, that reach the detector wall is `N(t_lab) / N₀`. Substituting `t_lab = R / c` into our decay equation:\n    `f = N(R/c) / N₀ = exp(- (R/c) / (γ * τ₀) )`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `f = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ₀))`\n\n5.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios:**\n    The problem gives us two scenarios. The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup, as `R` (detector radius) and `τ₀` (particle's proper lifetime) do not change. Let's call this constant `K = R / (c * τ₀)`.\n    The survival fraction formula becomes: `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Survival fraction, `f₁ = 1/3`\n\n        Plugging these values in:\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n        Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?` (This is what we need to find)\n        *   Survival fraction, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n        Plugging these values in:\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n        Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n        `ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n        `γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    Now we can substitute the expression for `K` that we found from Scenario 1 into the equation for `γ₂` from Scenario 2:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    To get the final number, we'll use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the values of ln(3) and ln(3/2) or ln(1.5)\nln_3 = math.log(3)\nln_1_5 = math.log(1.5)\n\n# Calculate gamma_2 using the derived formula\ngamma_1 = 20\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln_3 / ln_1_5\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n>>>54.1996168925232\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` is approximately 54.2.\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 40\n    *   B) 54\n    *   C) 68\n    *   D) 28\n\nThe calculated value of 54.2 is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical law:** The decay of a population of unstable particles over time is described by the exponential decay law. When considering particles moving at relativistic speeds, this law must be adjusted for time dilation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the survival fraction equation:**\n    The number of particles `N` remaining at a lab time `t_lab` from an initial population `N₀` is given by:\n    `N(t_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ₀))`\n    where:\n    *   `γ` is the Lorentz factor of the particles.\n    *   `τ₀` is the proper mean lifetime of the particles (their lifetime in their own rest frame).\n\n    The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive is `N(t_lab) / N₀`.\n    `f = exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n3.  **Calculate the time of flight in the lab frame (`t_lab`):**\n    The particles travel from the center of the spherical detector to its inner wall, a distance equal to the radius `R`. The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. We can therefore approximate `v ≈ c`.\n    The time of flight is `t_lab = distance / speed = R / c`.\n\n4.  **Combine the equations:**\n    Substitute `t_lab = R / c` into the survival fraction equation:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n    This can be rearranged as:\n    `f = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))`\n\n5.  **Analyze the given scenarios:**\n    For this problem, the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ₀` are all constants. Let's group them into a single constant, `K = R / (c * τ₀)`.\n    The survival fraction equation simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n    To solve for `γ`, we can rearrange the equation by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(f) = -K / γ`\n    `γ * ln(f) = -K`\n    `γ * -ln(f) = K`\n    `γ * ln(1/f) = K`\n\n    Since `K` is a constant, the product `γ * ln(1/f)` must be the same for both scenarios.\n    `γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂)`\n\n6.  **Plug in the values and solve for the unknown `γ₂`:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`. So, `1/f₁ = 3`.\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`. So, `1/f₂ = 3/2 = 1.5`.\n\n    Substitute these values into the equation:\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(1.5)`\n\n    Solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the numerical result:**\n    Now, we compute the value using the provided code interpreter.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Using the derived formula: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 54.19.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 40\nB) 54\nC) 68\nD) 28\n\nThe value 54.19 is closest to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Principles:**\n    *   The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The fraction `f` of particles that survive after a certain time `t_proper` in their own rest frame is given by `f = exp(-t_proper / τ₀)`, where `τ₀` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, time is relative. The time elapsed in the lab's frame of reference (`t_lab`) is related to the time elapsed in the particle's moving frame (`t_proper`) by the formula `t_lab = γ * t_proper`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. This phenomenon is known as time dilation.\n\n2.  **Deriving the Survival Fraction in the Lab Frame:**\n    From the time dilation formula, we can express the proper time as `t_proper = t_lab / γ`. Substituting this into the decay equation gives us the survival fraction as a function of lab time:\n    `f = exp(-(t_lab / γ) / τ₀) = exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n3.  **Applying the Formula to the Problem:**\n    The particles are created at the center of the detector and travel to the inner wall, a distance `R` = 30 meters. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    Substituting this into our survival fraction equation:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n4.  **Setting up a Relationship between the Two Scenarios:**\n    The quantity `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for a given particle type and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation becomes:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n    We can solve for `K` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(f) = -K / γ`\n    `K = -γ * ln(f)` or `K = γ * ln(1/f)`\n\n    Since `K` is a constant, the value of `γ * ln(1/f)` must be the same for both scenarios described in the problem.\n    `γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂)`\n\n5.  **Solving for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    We are given:\n    *   Scenario 1: `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`. Thus, `1/f₁ = 3`.\n    *   Scenario 2: `f₂ = 2/3`. Thus, `1/f₂ = 3/2 = 1.5`. We need to find `γ₂`.\n\n    Plugging these values into our relationship:\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(1.5)`\n\n    Rearranging to solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    We can now compute the value of `γ₂`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\n# Let's calculate this value.\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe calculated value is approximately 54.19. This is closest to the integer 54.\n\nComparing the result to the options:\nA) 40\nB) 54\nC) 68\nD) 28\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
