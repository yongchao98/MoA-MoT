    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understanding the System and Method**\n\n*   We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V = 0).\n*   The charge `q` induces an opposite charge on the surface of the sphere.\n*   To solve this problem, we use the **method of image charges**. This method simplifies the problem by replacing the complex charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThis image charge is located on the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. Since `d > R`, the position `b` is inside the sphere.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A key formula for the potential energy (`U`) of a charge `q` in the presence of a grounded conductor is:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor.\n\nUsing the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere is identical to the potential created by the single image charge `q'`.\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Find the potential at position `d` due to the image charge `q'`.**\n    The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center. The image charge `q'` is at a distance `b` from the center. The distance between them is `d - b`.\n\n    The potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`1 / (4πε₀)`).\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`.**\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Simplify the expression for `V_induced`.**\n    First, simplify the denominator:\n    `d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-qR / d] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / d * [d / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   **Step 3.4: Calculate the total potential energy `U`.**\n    Now, use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Comparing with the Options**\n\nThe calculated potential energy is `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n\nOur result matches option C. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\n<<<C>>>"
