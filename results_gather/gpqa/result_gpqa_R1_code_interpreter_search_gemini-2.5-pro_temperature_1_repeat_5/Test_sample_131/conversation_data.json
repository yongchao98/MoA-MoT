    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Verify the Molecular Formula of the Options:**\nFirst, let's confirm that all proposed compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzenes (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, 1,2,3,4-):** A benzene ring (C6) with 4 methyl groups (4 x CH3) and 2 hydrogens on the ring. The formula is C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2C4H12 = **C10H14**. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers fit.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** A benzene ring (C6) with 2 ethyl groups (2 x C2H5) and 4 hydrogens on the ring. The formula is C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4C4H10 = **C10H14**. This also fits.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound:**\nWe need to predict the number of signals, multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and integration for the protons in each molecule based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups are not all equivalent.\n        *   Methyls at 1 and 3 are equivalent.\n        *   Methyl at 2 is unique.\n        *   Methyl at 5 is unique.\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H : 3H : 3H**, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   Methyls at 1 and 4 are equivalent.\n        *   Methyls at 2 and 3 are equivalent.\n        *   This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The protons within the ethyl group are not.\n        *   The CH2 (methylene) protons will be a **quartet** (split by the 3 adjacent CH3 protons). Integration: **4H**.\n        *   The CH3 (methyl) protons will be a **triplet** (split by the 2 adjacent CH2 protons). Integration: **6H**.\n    *   Since the problem states the alkyl signals are all singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated** from consideration.\n\n**4. Analyze the Spectra of the Possible Mixtures:**\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio). Let's test the combination from option D, which involves the two compounds that seem most promising.\n\n**Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option D):**\n\n*   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-TMB):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n*   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,4-TMB):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\nLet's combine their spectra for a 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** We get one singlet from Compound 1 (relative intensity 2H) and one singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 2H). Assuming they appear at slightly different chemical shifts, this gives **two singlets**. The integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:** We get one singlet from Compound 1 (relative intensity 12H) and two singlets from Compound 2 (relative intensities 6H and 6H). This gives a total of **three singlets**. The integration ratio is 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 mixture is the only one that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
