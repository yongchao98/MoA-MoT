    "An elegant way to solve this problem is by using the fundamental principles of angular momentum addition in quantum mechanics.\n\n1.  **Identify the System's State:**\n    The system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1$: orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2=1$: orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l=2$: total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m=-1$: the quantum number for the z-component of the total angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Relate Total and Individual Angular Momenta:**\n    The total angular momentum operator $\\vec{L}$ is the vector sum of the individual angular momentum operators, $\\vec{L} = \\vec{L}_1 + \\vec{L}_2$.\n    This relationship also holds for their components. For the z-component, we have:\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n\n3.  **Eigenvalues and Conservation:**\n    The state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$. When we measure $L_z$ on this state, we will always get the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    The operators for the individual z-components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, commute with each other. When we perform a joint measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, the sum of the measured eigenvalues must be equal to the eigenvalue of the total $L_z$.\n    Let the measured eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ be $m_{l1}\\hbar$ and the measured eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ be $m_{l2}\\hbar$. Then it must be that:\n    $m_{l1}\\hbar + m_{l2}\\hbar = m\\hbar$\n    This simplifies to the conservation of the magnetic quantum number:\n    $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Specific Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome:\n    *   Measurement of $L_{1z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   Measurement of $L_{2z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n5.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    For this specific outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is:\n    $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    However, the system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number is known to be $m = -1$.\n    We have a contradiction: $-2 \\neq -1$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The measurement outcome where $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$ is physically impossible for a system that is in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This is because the sum of the z-components of angular momentum for the parts would not equal the known z-component of the total angular momentum. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is zero.\n\nThis can also be seen using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is a superposition of uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$ where $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$. The state corresponding to the desired measurement outcome is $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$. Since for this state, the sum of quantum numbers is $-2$, it is not a component of the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The projection of the initial state onto this measurement state is zero, and thus the probability is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
