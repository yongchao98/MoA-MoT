    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (like a C=O carbonyl group, which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3500-3300 cm-1) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group. A secondary amine (-NHR) would typically show only one band.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester C=O stretch (around 1735 cm-1), which is slightly lowered by conjugation with the aromatic ring. An amide C=O would typically appear at a lower frequency (around 1680 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet multiplicity (t) indicates it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group (according to the n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks). This is characteristic of a methyl (-CH3) group in an ethyl fragment.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet multiplicity (q) indicates it is adjacent to a methyl (-CH3) group (3+1=4 peaks). The downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-). Together with the signal at 1.20 ppm, this confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) as part of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region is typical for the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Having two doublets that each integrate to 2 protons is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, meaning they are ortho to an electron-donating group (like -NH2). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, meaning they are ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (like the ester group, -COOR).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a benzene ring that is para-substituted (from NMR).\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine, -NH2 (from IR and NMR).\n    3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3 (from IR and NMR).\n    4.  This structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (meta, not para) and is an amide, not an ester.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester, but the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl (R-CO-CH2CH3), which would place the quartet signal around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data (which shows a primary amine) and the NMR data (which shows 2 amine protons).\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the para-substituted aromatic ring, ethyl ester group, and primary amine signals in the 1H NMR.\n\n<<<D>>>"
