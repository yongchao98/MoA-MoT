    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n*   **Core Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X), meaning a halogen (like F, Cl, Br, I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure:**\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for a two-carbon substituent containing a C=O group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This fits perfectly. It has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting molecule would be a halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n    *   **Phenylacetaldehyde derivative (-CH2CHO):** This also fits. The substituent -CH2CHO has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting molecule would be a halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n*   Both `X-C6H4-COCH3` and `X-C6H4-CH2CHO` are valid structures based on the initial description. Both have 8 carbons, a di-substituted ring, a carbonyl, and an aromatic-halogen bond. The molecular formula for both would be C8H7XO, meaning they have 7 protons.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Possible Structures:**\nThe options present spectra with two doublets in the aromatic region, which is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substitution pattern**. So we will assume para-substitution for our analysis.\n\n*   **Case 1: para-halo-acetophenone (p-X-C6H4-COCH3)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The benzene ring has two types of protons. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be strongly deshielded. The two protons ortho to the halogen will also be deshielded, but typically less so. We expect two doublets in the region of **~7.4-8.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH3) is attached to a carbonyl. This deshields the protons. We expect a singlet (no adjacent protons) around **~2.3-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Total Protons:** 4H (aromatic) + 3H (methyl) = 7H.\n\n*   **Case 2: para-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (p-X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (1H):** The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is highly deshielded. We expect a singlet around **~9.5-10.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The -CH2CHO group is less electron-withdrawing than a directly attached carbonyl. The aromatic protons would be less deshielded than in Case 1. We expect two doublets in the region of **~7.1-7.4 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (2H):** The benzylic methylene protons (-CH2-) are deshielded by both the ring and the adjacent carbonyl. We expect a singlet around **~3.6-3.8 ppm**.\n    *   **Total Protons:** 1H (aldehyde) + 4H (aromatic) + 2H (methylene) = 7H.\n\n**4. Analyze the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. It lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (7-8 ppm).\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum appears to describe the phenylacetaldehyde structure (Case 2), with the aldehyde (9.9 ppm) and methylene (3.7 ppm) protons matching well. However, the aromatic shifts (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are too high (too deshielded). They are characteristic of a ketone directly attached to the ring (Case 1), not a phenylacetaldehyde. This option contains an internal inconsistency.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is a perfect match for our prediction for para-halo-acetophenone (Case 1).\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, consistent with a para-substituted ring bearing a strong electron-withdrawing group. Total integration is 4H.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** A singlet in the correct region for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. Integration is 3H.\n    *   Total integration is 7H. This is a chemically consistent and accurate spectrum for the structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. A di-substituted benzene ring should have 4 aromatic protons, not 1. The integrations are also inconsistent with any likely structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe NMR data in option C perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a para-halo-acetophenone, which is a valid structure derived from the problem description. The data in option B, while appearing plausible at first glance, contains chemically inconsistent chemical shifts for the aromatic protons. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
