    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and present in a form that is not a racemic mixture.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1 and C2) and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is essentially planar. A molecule with a plane of symmetry (in this case, the molecular plane itself) is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides crucial information.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereochemical descriptors (3a**R**, 7a**S**, **E**) specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The presence of R/S descriptors indicates that there are chiral centers in the molecule. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active. This molecule is highly asymmetric and is not a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the molecule has a symmetric structure (the two ends are identical -COOH groups). The (2R, 3S) configuration results in a meso compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. We can see this by drawing its Fischer projection, which has a center of inversion, making it superimposable on its mirror image.\n          COOH\n           |\n      CH₃--|--H   (R)\n           |\n      H----|--CH₃ (S)\n           |\n          COOH\n    *   This molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral (meso compound) and optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. They are chiral and non-superimposable on their mirror images. The name specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon atom C1 is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment -CH₂-CH=, and 4) the ring segment -CH₂-CH₂-. Since the two paths around the ring from C1 are different, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation (1s,3s,5s) implies that all three -OH groups have the same relative orientation (i.e., they are all cis to each other).\n    *   **Analysis:** This all-cis isomer is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) and three planes of symmetry (σᵥ). For example, a plane of symmetry passes through the C1-O bond and the C4 atom. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH₃)₂CHCH₂C(=O)-cyclopentyl\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check for any chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups (one is C4, the other is the substituent), and the -CH₂C(=O)-cyclopentyl group. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. No other atom in the molecule is a chiral center. The molecule can adopt conformations that possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active compounds:\n    1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n*   Optically inactive compounds:\n    1.  (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    2.  (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    4.  1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<A>>>"
