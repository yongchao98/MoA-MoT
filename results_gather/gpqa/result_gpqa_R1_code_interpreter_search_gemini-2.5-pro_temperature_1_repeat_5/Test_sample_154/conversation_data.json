    "The user wants to find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ for a given quantum state.\n\n**1. Understand the definition of Uncertainty**\n\nThe uncertainty of an operator $A$, denoted as $\\Delta A$, is given by the formula:\n$\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\nwhere $\\langle A \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$ and $\\langle A^2 \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A^2$.\n\n**2. Identify the given state and operator**\n\nThe state of the system is given by the column vector (ket):\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe corresponding bra vector is the conjugate transpose:\n$\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe operator $P_z$ is given by the matrix:\n$P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\nFirst, let's calculate the action of $P_z$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we compute the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n**4. Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n\nFirst, we need to find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\nFirst, calculate $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, compute the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**5. Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n\nNow we can plug the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty of $P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTo be certain, let's verify with a Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define hbar\nhbar = 1.0 \n\n# The state vector |psi>\npsi = np.array([\n    [-1/2],\n    [1/np.sqrt(2)],\n    [-1/2]\n])\n\n# The operator Pz\nPz = hbar * np.array([\n    [1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, -1]\n])\n\n# Conjugate transpose of psi, <psi|\npsi_dagger = psi.conj().T\n\n# Expectation value of Pz, <Pz>\nexp_Pz = (psi_dagger @ Pz @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Operator Pz^2\nPz2 = Pz @ Pz\n\n# Expectation value of Pz^2, <Pz^2>\nexp_Pz2 = (psi_dagger @ Pz2 @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Variance of Pz\nvariance_Pz = exp_Pz2 - exp_Pz**2\n\n# Uncertainty of Pz\nuncertainty_Pz = np.sqrt(variance_Pz)\n\n# The result is in units of hbar. hbar/sqrt(2)\n# We can print the numerical value to confirm.\n# The value of 1/sqrt(2) is about 0.707\nprint(f\"The uncertainty of Pz is {uncertainty_Pz} * hbar\")\n```\nThe code will confirm the result.\n\nFinal answer is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
