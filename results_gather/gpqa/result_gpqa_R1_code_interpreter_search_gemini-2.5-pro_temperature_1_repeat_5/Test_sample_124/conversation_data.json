    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is the same in all directions, as it only depends on the radial distance $r$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be found by solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation. A common method is to separate the variables in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. The potential becomes $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. The Hamiltonian separates into three independent 1D harmonic oscillators:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i=0, 1, 2, ...$.\n    The total energy is the sum of the energies from the three dimensions:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    We can define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy formula simplifies to:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy of the Excited States:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which is for $n=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have the same energy. For the third excited state ($n=3$), we need to find the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\n    $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$\n    We can list the combinations:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3, 0, 0). This can be arranged in 3 ways: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3).\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: (2, 1, 0). This can be arranged in $3! = 6$ ways: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2).\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1, 1, 1). This can be arranged in only 1 way.\n    The total number of combinations (the degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ for the $n$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   The calculated energy for the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The calculated degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.\n\n    Matching these results with the options:\n    A) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$ - Incorrect energy.\n    B) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3$ - Incorrect energy and degeneracy.\n    C) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10$ - Correct energy and degeneracy.\n    D) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$ - Correct energy, but incorrect degeneracy (degeneracy of 3 corresponds to the first excited state).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
