    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero. It has a cavity inside.\n\n2.  **Introduce the charge:** A positive point charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Induction of charges:** The presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute themselves.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** Negative charges (electrons) in the conductor are attracted towards the positive charge `+q`. They accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface within the material of the conductor that encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero (as it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the field to be zero, the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity to cancel out the `+q` charge.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality. This `+q` charge will reside on the outer surface of the conductor, as charges in a conductor move to its surfaces.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. The charge distribution on the inner surface (`-q`) arranges itself in such a way that its electric field, combined with the electric field of the point charge `+q`, results in a zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity. This ensures that the electric field inside the bulk material of the conductor is zero.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** Because the combined field of the charge `+q` in the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero outside the cavity, the electric field at the external point P is solely due to the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius `R`. This outer surface is shielded from the non-uniform arrangement of charges inside the cavity. With no other external electric fields present, the charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly over the sphere.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field (Shell Theorem):** According to the shell theorem (which is a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at an external point due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the electric field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is the point from which the distance `L` is measured.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge `q` at the center of the conductor:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's size (`r`), its position (`s`), the exact location of the charge `+q` within the cavity, the distance from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `Î¸` are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect. The field outside behaves as if a single point charge `+q` were located at the center of the large sphere.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
