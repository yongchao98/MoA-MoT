    "This is a classic particle decay problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the decay process:**\n    The positive pion (Pi+) decays into a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu).\n    Reaction: `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n\n2.  **State the conservation laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n3.  **Analyze the initial state (before decay):**\n    *   The pion (Pi+) is stationary (at rest).\n    *   Initial momentum, `P_initial = 0`.\n    *   Initial energy, `E_initial`, is purely its rest mass energy: `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the final state (after decay):**\n    *   The products are a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).\n    *   Let their momenta be `p_mu` and `p_nu`, and their total energies be `E_mu` and `E_nu`.\n    *   **From Conservation of Momentum:**\n        `P_initial = P_final`\n        `0 = p_mu + p_nu` (vector sum)\n        This implies `p_mu = -p_nu`. The muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n        So, `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`.\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n6.  **Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:**\n    The total energy `E` of a particle is given by `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    *   For the muon (mu+): `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    *   For the neutrino (nu): Neutrinos have a very small mass, which is considered negligible in this type of problem. We'll approximate its rest mass as zero (`m_nu = 0`).\n        Therefore, `E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (0)^2`, which simplifies to `E_nu = p*c`.\n\n7.  **Solve for the unknowns:**\n    We have a system of equations. Let's substitute the expressions for energy into the conservation equation:\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + p*c`\n    We can express `E_mu` in terms of `p*c`: `E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`.\n    So, `m_pi * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2) + p*c`.\n\n    Now, we solve for `p*c` (which is also the energy of the neutrino, `E_nu`):\n    `m_pi * c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n    Square both sides:\n    `(m_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    `(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * (p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    The `(p*c)^2` terms cancel out:\n    `(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * m_pi * c^2 * p*c = (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    Rearrange to solve for `p*c`:\n    `(m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2 = 2 * m_pi * c^2 * p*c`\n    `p*c = [ (m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi * c^2 ]`\n\n8.  **Calculate the kinetic energies:**\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_nu):** Since we assumed its rest mass is zero, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy. `KE_nu = E_nu = p*c`.\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_mu):** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy: `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2`. We can find `E_mu` from the energy conservation equation: `E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu`.\n\n    Let's use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest mass energy of Pi(+)\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest mass energy of mu(+)\n\n# Calculate p*c, which is the total energy of the neutrino (E_nu)\n# E_nu = pc = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi*c^2 ]\nE_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) is its total energy, as its rest mass is assumed to be zero.\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu) using conservation of energy\nE_mu = m_pi_c2 - E_nu\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# Print the results, formatted to two decimal places to match the options\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKinetic Energy of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic Energy of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV for the muon (mu+) and approximately 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (nu). This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Principles of Conservation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. Since the initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, its total energy is just its rest mass energy, `E_pi = m_pi * c^2`. After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu), `E_mu + E_nu`.\n    *   `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after. Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   `p_mu = p_nu = p` (in magnitude)\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy**\n\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the muon: `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n*   For the neutrino: The neutrino's rest mass is considered to be zero in this context. Therefore, its energy is entirely kinetic: `E_nu = p*c`.\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\nWe can now solve for the energies.\n\n*   Substitute `E_nu = p*c` into the energy conservation equation:\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + p*c` => `p*c = m_pi * c^2 - E_mu`\n\n*   Substitute this expression for `p*c` into the energy equation for the muon:\n    `E_mu^2 = (m_pi * c^2 - E_mu)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    `E_mu^2 = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi*c^2)E_mu + E_mu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\n*   Simplify by canceling `E_mu^2` and solving for `E_mu`:\n    `2(m_pi*c^2)E_mu = (m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n    `E_mu = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi*c^2 ]`\n\n*   However, it's simpler to first solve for `p*c` (which is `E_nu`), as derived in the initial reasoning step:\n    `p*c = E_nu = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi*c^2 ]`\n\n**4. Plugging in the Values**\n\nUsing the given rest mass energies:\n*   `m_pi*c^2 = 139.6` MeV\n*   `m_mu*c^2 = 105.7` MeV\n\nThe code execution performed the following calculation:\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_nu = E_nu):**\n    `E_nu = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n    `E_nu = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n    `E_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2 â‰ˆ 29.78` MeV, which is approximately **29.8 MeV**.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_mu):**\n    First, find the total energy of the muon using energy conservation:\n    `E_mu = m_pi*c^2 - E_nu`\n    `E_mu = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82` MeV\n    Then, find its kinetic energy by subtracting its rest mass energy:\n    `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2`\n    `KE_mu = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12` MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
