    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules (containing only single C-C bonds), so this observation is consistent with all of them.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The most crucial pieces of information are the complex splitting patterns observed for two different protons:\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\n**3. Understanding Complex Splitting (n+1 rule)**\n\nThe splitting of a proton's signal is determined by the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons (vicinal coupling). A signal is split into `n+1` peaks, where `n` is the number of neighboring protons.\n\n*   A **doublet (d)** means 1 neighboring proton (`1+1=2`).\n*   A **triplet (t)** means 2 neighboring protons (`2+1=3`).\n*   A **quartet (q)** means 3 neighboring protons (`3+1=4`).\n\nA complex pattern like `dtq` or `dtt` arises when a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons. To have three neighboring groups, the proton must be on a carbon that is bonded to three other carbons, each bearing protons.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze each structure to see if its protons would produce the observed splitting patterns. We will focus on the methine protons (-CH-), as they are most likely to have multiple, distinct neighbors.\n\n*   **Structure C: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   `CH3 - CH(b)(CH3) - CH(c)(CH3) - CH2(d) - COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(c):** Is adjacent to `CH2(d)` (2H), `CH(b)` (1H), and its own methyl group (3H).\n        *   Coupling to `CH2(d)` (2H) -> triplet (t)\n        *   Coupling to `CH(b)` (1H) -> doublet (d)\n        *   Coupling to its own methyl (3H) -> quartet (q)\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **Proton H(b):** Is adjacent to `CH3` at the end (3H), `CH(c)` (1H), and its own methyl group (3H).\n        *   Coupling to terminal `CH3` (3H) -> quartet (q)\n        *   Coupling to `CH(c)` (1H) -> doublet (d)\n        *   Coupling to its own methyl (3H) -> quartet (q)\n        *   This proton's signal would be a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq). This is **not a dtt**.\n    *   *Conclusion: Structure C is incorrect.*\n\n*   **Structure D: `CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   `CH3CH2 - CH(c)(CH3) - CH(d)(CH3) - COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(c):** Is adjacent to `CH2` (2H), `CH(d)` (1H), and its own methyl group (3H).\n        *   Coupling to `CH2` (2H) -> triplet (t)\n        *   Coupling to `CH(d)` (1H) -> doublet (d)\n        *   Coupling to its own methyl (3H) -> quartet (q)\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **Proton H(d) (alpha-proton):** Is adjacent to `CH(c)` (1H) and its own methyl group (3H). Its signal would be a doublet of quartets (dq). This is **not a dtt**.\n    *   *Conclusion: Structure D is incorrect.*\n\n*   **Structure A: `CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH` (2,3-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   `CH3CH2 - CH(c)(C2H5) - CH(d)(C2H5) - COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(c):** Is adjacent to `CH2` from the main chain (2H), `CH(d)` (1H), and the `CH2` of its ethyl group (2H).\n        *   Coupling to main chain `CH2` (2H) -> triplet (t)\n        *   Coupling to `CH(d)` (1H) -> doublet (d)\n        *   Coupling to ethyl `CH2` (2H) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **Proton H(d) (alpha-proton):** Is adjacent to `CH(c)` (1H) and the `CH2` of its ethyl group (2H). Its signal would be a doublet of triplets (dt). This is **not a dtq**.\n    *   *Conclusion: Structure A is incorrect.*\n\n*   **Structure B: `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`**\n    Let's correctly identify the structure first. The longest chain including the COOH is a pentanoic acid with ethyl groups at positions 3 and 4. So this is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   `CH3(a) - CH(b)(C2H5) - CH(c)(C2H5) - CH2(d) - COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(c):** Is adjacent to `CH2(d)` (2H), `CH(b)` (1H), and the `CH2` of its own ethyl group (2H).\n        *   Coupling to `CH2(d)` (2H) -> triplet (t)\n        *   Coupling to `CH(b)` (1H) -> doublet (d)\n        *   Coupling to its ethyl `CH2` (2H) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **Proton H(b):** Is adjacent to `CH3(a)` (3H), `CH(c)` (1H), and the `CH2` of its own ethyl group (2H).\n        *   Coupling to `CH3(a)` (3H) -> quartet (q)\n        *   Coupling to `CH(c)` (1H) -> doublet (d)\n        *   Coupling to its ethyl `CH2` (2H) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   *Conclusion: Structure B has protons that produce both a dtt and a dtq. This is the correct structure.*\n\n**Final Identification**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the splitting patterns in the 1H NMR spectrum, only structure B, `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`, is consistent with the observation of both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).\n\n<<<B>>>"
