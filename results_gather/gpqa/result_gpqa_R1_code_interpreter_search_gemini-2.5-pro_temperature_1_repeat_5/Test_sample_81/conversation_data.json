    "Based on the analysis, the reaction proceeds via the thermodynamic pathway due to heating.\nStep 1: Cyclooctatetraene + Maleic Anhydride (Heated) -> Forms the thermodynamic 'exo' adduct of bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene and maleic anhydride. In this adduct, the anhydride ring and the cyclobutene ring are on opposite sides ('anti').\nStep 2: Esterification preserves this 'exo' stereochemistry for the diester groups.\nStep 3: Diels-Alder with cyclopentadiene. The dienophile is the double bond in the bicyclo[2.2.2]octene core of product 2. Cyclopentadiene will attack from the less hindered face. The 'exo' diester groups are on one face, the cyclobutene ring is on the other. Attack will occur from the face anti to the bulkier cyclobutene ring, meaning 'syn' to the diester groups. The addition will follow the kinetic 'endo' rule.\nThis specific combination of stereochemical controls (exo, syn-attack, endo-addition) leads to a specific diastereomer. We need to identify which option corresponds to this.\nOption D is eliminated because the diester is 'trans' (R,R configuration), which would arise from fumarate, not maleic anhydride.\nOptions A and B are diastereomers of C, differing in the initial 'endo' vs 'exo' configuration of the first Diels-Alder adduct. 'Heated' points to 'exo'. This favors C.\nLet's analyze the stereocenters in C: dimethyl (1R,4S,4aS,4bR,5S,8R,8aS,8bR,10S,11R)-...\nThis set of stereodescriptors corresponds to the structure derived from the thermodynamic exo adduct from step 1, followed by an endo addition of cyclopentadiene in step 3.\nTherefore, C is the most likely structure for the major product under these conditions.\n<<<C>>>"
