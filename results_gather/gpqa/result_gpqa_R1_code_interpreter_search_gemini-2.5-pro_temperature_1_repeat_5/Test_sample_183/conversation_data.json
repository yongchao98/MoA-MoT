    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  -OCH2CH3 (ethoxy group) at C1\n    2.  -C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl group) at C2\n    3.  -NO2 (nitro group) at C3\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** 1,2,3 (vicinal)\n*   **Relative Positions:**\n    *   Ethoxy and tert-butyl are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   Ethoxy and nitro are *meta* to each other.\n    *   tert-butyl and nitro are *ortho* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Activator, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, so it sterically hinders the positions ortho to it.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nThe most striking feature is the *meta* relationship between the strong *o,p*-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group. This suggests that the nitration did not occur when the ethoxy group was present. The directing group at C1 must have been a *meta*-director during the nitration step, or the substitution pattern was controlled by other groups that were later removed or modified.\n\nLet's consider the final steps:\n*   The ethoxy group is likely introduced from a phenol (-OH) using the Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr). So, the precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   A phenol (-OH) group is often made from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) followed by hydrolysis (H2O, heat). So, the precursor to the phenol is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\nNow, the central problem is the synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. Let's analyze the substitution pattern: NH2 at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C3.\n*   A direct Friedel-Crafts alkylation on 3-nitroaniline is unlikely to work well. The ring is deactivated, and the Lewis acid would react with the amino group.\n*   A direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline is also problematic. The amino group (-NH2) and the tert-butyl group are both *o,p*-directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not position 3. Even if the aniline is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director, its directing effect would conflict with the *o,p*-directing t-butyl group, leading to a mixture of products and not being a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\nThis complex 1,2,3-pattern often requires the use of **blocking groups** to control regiochemistry. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is an excellent blocking group because it is a *meta*-director and can be easily removed by heating with dilute acid.\n\n**4. A Plausible High-Yield Pathway**\n\nLet's construct a plausible high-yield synthesis based on established organic chemistry principles, which we can then compare to the given options.\n\n*   **Step 1: Introduction of tert-butyl group.**\n    *   Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n*   **Step 2: Blocking the para position.**\n    *   The t-butyl group is an *o,p*-director. To force subsequent substitution into the *ortho* position, we block the sterically favored *para* position.\n    *   tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Ortho-nitration.**\n    *   Now, nitration will occur at the position that is *ortho* to the t-butyl group and *meta* to the sulfonic acid group. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C2).\n    *   4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a high-yield reaction.\n\n*   **Step 4: Reduction of the nitro group.**\n    *   The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Diazotization of the amino group.**\n    *   The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt, a versatile intermediate.\n    *   2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + NaNO2/HCl → **Corresponding diazonium salt**.\n\nAt this point, the proposed sequences diverge, and the options provided contain unusual or incorrectly ordered steps. Let's analyze the options based on the highly logical start we've established (steps 1-3).\n\n**5. Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **Option A:** Starts with alkylation, then nitration. This gives the *para*-nitro isomer as the major product and the desired *ortho*-nitro isomer as a minor product. This is not a \"high-yield\" method. The last two steps (sulfonation then desulfonation) are pointless as written.\n*   **Option C:** Starts with nitration, deactivating the ring, followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation on an aniline derivative. This is highly problematic and inefficient.\n*   **Option D:** Is riddled with typos and has a nonsensical step (diazotization without an amine).\n*   **Option B:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...\n    This sequence starts exactly with the first three steps of our logical, high-yield synthesis plan (alkylation → para-sulfonation → ortho-nitration). This is the most promising start. Let's analyze the rest of the sequence, acknowledging potential typos which are common in such complex problems.\n    *   i, ii, iii → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. (Excellent start)\n    *   iv) Fe/HCl → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (Logical reduction)\n    *   v) NaNO2/HCl → **Diazonium salt**. (Logical next step)\n    *   The rest of the sequence (vi: HNO3/H2SO4 on a diazonium salt; vii: H3O+; viii: dil. H2SO4; ix: NaOH/EtBr) appears scrambled and contains a chemically nonsensical step (vi). However, the list of reagents is correct for converting the diazonium intermediate into the final product through a series of transformations (e.g., conversion to a phenol, etherification, introduction of the second nitro group, and removal of the sulfonic acid blocking group), albeit in the wrong order.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the scrambled and erroneous nature of the later steps in all options, **Option B** begins with the most chemically sound and high-yield strategy for creating the required ortho-relationship between the tert-butyl group and the first nitro group by using a sulfonic acid blocking group. This is the critical part of controlling the regiochemistry. The other options start with fundamentally flawed strategies for a high-yield synthesis. Therefore, Option B represents the most plausible intended pathway.\n\n<<<B>>>"
