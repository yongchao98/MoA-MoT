    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe system starts as a bound state of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   For `1S0`, we have `2S+1 = 1`, which means the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` corresponds to the total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` means the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n*   The particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n*   The particle X is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X`. The lowercase letters denote this: `s` (l=0), `p` (l=1), `d` (l=2), `f` (l=3).\n*   The final NN state has quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`, and isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\nWe must apply three conservation laws and constraints:\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state is `J_i = 0`. The total angular momentum of the final state is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). For the total to be conserved (`J_final = J_i = 0`), we must have `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity:**\n    The parity of the initial state is `P_i = +1`. The parity of the final state is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(relative motion)`.\n    `P_f = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    For parity to be conserved (`P_f = P_i`), we must have `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    This implies `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state, `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    We are given that `T_f = 0`. Substituting this in, we get:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This equation holds if and only if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will test each option against the three derived conditions:\n1.  `J_f = l_X`\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd\n3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd\n\n| Option | Reaction               | NN Final State (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) | X State (`l_X`) | `J_f = l_X`? | `L_f + l_X` is odd? | `S_f + L_f` is odd? | Permitted? |\n| :----: | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :-------------- | :----------- | :------------------ | :------------------ | :--------- |\n| **A)** | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`       | S=1, L=1, J=0                        | l=0             | 0 = 0 (Yes)  | 1 + 0 = 1 (Yes)     | 1 + 1 = 2 (**No**)  | **No**     |\n| **B)** | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`       | S=1, L=2, J=3                        | l=3             | 3 = 3 (Yes)  | 2 + 3 = 5 (Yes)     | 1 + 2 = 3 (Yes)     | Yes        |\n| **C)** | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`       | S=3, L=2, J=1                        | l=1             | 1 = 1 (Yes)  | 2 + 1 = 3 (Yes)     | 3 + 2 = 5 (Yes)     | Yes*       |\n| **D)** | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`       | S=1, L=0, J=1                        | l=1             | 1 = 1 (Yes)  | 0 + 1 = 1 (Yes)     | 1 + 0 = 1 (Yes)     | Yes        |\n\n\\*Note on Option C: The final state `7D1` implies a spin `S=3` for the two-nucleon system. Since nucleons are spin-1/2 particles, their total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. Thus, the state `7D1` is physically impossible. However, when strictly applying the rules *given in the problem*, this transition is formally allowed. The question asks to identify the non-permitted partial wave based on the provided conservation laws and Pauli condition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, reaction A is the only one that violates one of the conditions explicitly derived from the problem statement. It fails the Pauli statistics requirement that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T_f=0` final state.\n\n<<<A>>>"
