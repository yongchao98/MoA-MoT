Determine the constraint imposed by \"optical ground-based telescopes\".\n# Ground-based telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most ultraviolet (UV) light.\n# The \"optical window\" of the atmosphere, where light can pass through to the ground, starts at a wavelength of approximately 3200 to 3500 Angstroms (320-350 nm).\n# For a signal to be detectable, its observed wavelength must be longer than this atmospheric cutoff.\n# Therefore, the minimum observed wavelength (lambda_obs_min) is the atmospheric cutoff wavelength.\n# Let's use a standard value of 3500 Angstroms for this cutoff.\nlambda_observed_min = 3500  # in Angstroms\n\n# 3. Use the redshift formula to find the corresponding redshift.\n# The formula for redshift (z) is: lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z)\n# We can rearrange this to solve for z: z = (lambda_observed / lambda_rest) - 1\n# To find the lower limit on the redshift, we use the minimum observable wavelength.\nz_min = (lambda_observed_min / lambda_rest) - 1\n\nprint(z_min)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The Lyman-alpha line has a rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to UV radiation, meaning that light at this wavelength cannot penetrate the atmosphere to reach ground-based telescopes. The atmospheric \"optical window\" begins at approximately 3200-3500 Angstroms (the blue/violet end of the visible spectrum).\n\nFor the Lyman-alpha line to be detectable from the ground, it must be redshifted to a wavelength that is within this optical window. We are looking for the *lower limit* on the redshift, which corresponds to the shortest observable wavelength.\n\nThe formula for redshift (z) is:\nλ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\nWhere:\n*   λ_observed is the wavelength measured by the observer on Earth.\n*   λ_rest is the wavelength emitted by the source (1216 Å for Lyman-alpha).\n*   z is the redshift.\n\nTo find the minimum redshift (z_min), we need to set λ_observed to the minimum wavelength that can pass through the atmosphere. Let's use a standard value for the atmospheric cutoff, λ_observed_min ≈ 3500 Å.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for z:\nz = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n\nNow, we can calculate the minimum redshift:\nz_min = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz_min ≈ 2.878 - 1\nz_min ≈ 1.878\n\nThe calculated lower limit for the redshift is approximately 1.88. Looking at the given options, the closest value is 1.9.\n\n<<<B>>>"
