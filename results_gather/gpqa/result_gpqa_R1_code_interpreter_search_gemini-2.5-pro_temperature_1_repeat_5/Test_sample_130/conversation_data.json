    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which is dehydrated to an anhydride. This is the classic preparation of maleic anhydride from maleic acid. The 1H NMR (one peak at 7 ppm for two equivalent vinyl protons) and 13C NMR (two peaks for two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons) confirm the symmetric structure of **maleic anhydride**. This is our dienophile.\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is our diene.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring, resulting in a bicyclic adduct.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** Generally, the *endo* product is the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance Exception:** However, in this specific case, the diene has four bulky methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene sterically hinder the approach of the anhydride in the *endo* orientation. This steric clash is so significant that it overrides the electronic preference for the *endo* product. Therefore, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product. This is a well-known exception to the endo rule.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures for NOESY Correlations:**\n    *   The NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Ã…). A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially close.\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct (major) but far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor).\n\n    *   Let's visualize the key protons in both isomers:\n        *   **Hb:** The two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule.\n        *   **Me-A:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   **Me-B:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons.\n\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the newly formed C=C double bond bridge. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (**Hb**) close to the vinylic methyl groups (**Me-A**). Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between Hb and Me-A is expected.\n\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the C=C double bond bridge. This geometry places the anhydride protons (**Hb**) far away from the vinylic methyl groups (**Me-A**). No significant NOE cross-peak between Hb and Me-A is expected.\n\n    *   This perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem. The cross-peak that distinguishes the major product from the minor product is the one between **Hb** and **Me-A**.\n\n5.  **Assign the 1H NMR Signals:**\n    *   We need to match the proton types (Hb and Me-A) to the signals given in the options. Based on typical chemical shifts:\n        *   **Hb:** These are two equivalent protons on sp3-hybridized carbons that are alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained bicyclic system. Their signal will be a **2H singlet** (due to a plane of symmetry) at a relatively downfield position, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Me-A:** These are six protons from two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls). Their signal will be a **6H singlet** at around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Me-B:** These are six protons from two equivalent methyl groups on saturated bridgehead carbons. They would be the most upfield signal, a **6H singlet** at **~1 ppm**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The distinguishing NOESY cross-peak in the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons (Hb) and the vinylic methyl groups (Me-A).\n    *   This corresponds to the connection between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nLet's verify this against the given options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-B) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (part of CH2 bridge).\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-B) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-A).\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-A) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hb).\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (part of CH2 bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hb).\n\nOur analysis points directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
