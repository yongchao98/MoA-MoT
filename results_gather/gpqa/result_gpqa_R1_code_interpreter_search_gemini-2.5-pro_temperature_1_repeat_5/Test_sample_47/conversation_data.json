    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a bromine atom substitutes a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). Cyclohexanone is a symmetric ketone, so both α-positions (C2 and C6) are equivalent. The reaction yields 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nThis reaction is a classic example of the Favorskii rearrangement. An α-halo ketone with an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-carbon) undergoes a ring contraction when treated with a strong base.\n1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6).\n2.  The resulting enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This forms a strained bicyclic intermediate (a cyclopropanone derivative: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained intermediate.\n4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the ring system opens up to relieve strain, forming a more stable cyclopentane ring with a carboxylate group.\n5.  Upon acidification (which is either done in a separate workup step or occurs in the next step), the carboxylate is protonated.\nThe overall result is the conversion of a six-membered ring (cyclohexanone derivative) to a five-membered ring carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a sterically hindered and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes. Unlike stronger reducing agents like LiAlH₄, it is not reactive enough to reduce the resulting aldehyde further to a primary alcohol. This is a selective reduction.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Let's analyze its structure to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments, which corresponds to the number of signals expected in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nLet's examine the symmetry of the molecule:\n*   The carbon atom of the cyclopentane ring that is attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  An aldehyde group (-CHO)\n    3.  The C2-C3-C4 part of the ring\n    4.  The C5-C4-C3 part of the ring\n    Since the two pathways around the ring are equivalent, let's re-examine. C1 is attached to H, CHO, C2, and C5. Since C2 and C5 are part of a ring, we must check for a plane of symmetry through the C1-CHO bond. Such a plane does not exist due to the puckered nature of the cyclopentane ring and the presence of the aldehyde group. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n*   A molecule with a single chiral center and no other stereocenters is chiral and lacks any element of symmetry (like a plane or center of symmetry). Such a molecule belongs to the C₁ point group.\n*   In a molecule with C₁ symmetry, all atoms that are not interchangeable by simple bond rotation are chemically non-equivalent.\n\nLet's count the hydrogens based on this principle:\n1.  **Aldehyde hydrogen:** The single hydrogen in the -CHO group is in a unique electronic environment. (1 distinct type)\n2.  **C1 hydrogen:** The single hydrogen on the chiral carbon C1 is unique. (1 distinct type)\n3.  **C2 and C5 hydrogens:** Since C1 is a chiral center, the adjacent carbons C2 and C5 are diastereotopic, meaning they are in different chemical environments.\n4.  **C3 and C4 hydrogens:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are diastereotopic.\n5.  **Protons on the same carbon:** On any given methylene group (CH₂) in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5), the two protons are also diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center. They are not equivalent.\n\nTherefore, every single hydrogen atom in the molecule is in a chemically distinct environment:\n*   Aldehyde H: 1\n*   C1-H: 1\n*   C2-H₂: 2 distinct protons\n*   C3-H₂: 2 distinct protons\n*   C4-H₂: 2 distinct protons\n*   C5-H₂: 2 distinct protons\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogens = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10.\n\n<<<D>>>"
