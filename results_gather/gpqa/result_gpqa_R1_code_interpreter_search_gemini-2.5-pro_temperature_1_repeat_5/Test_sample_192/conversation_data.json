    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given how the number of stars (N) varies with parallax (plx): N ~ 1/plx^5.\n    *   We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance (dN/dr) varies with distance (r).\n\n2.  **Interpret the Given Information:**\n    The statement \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\" refers to the number of stars found within a small interval of parallax, dp. This is a differential distribution, which we can write as:\n    dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx^5\n\n    *Why is this the correct interpretation?* In astronomy, when discussing star counts as a function of a parameter like magnitude or parallax, it's common to refer to the number density or distribution function (i.e., the number of stars per unit interval of that parameter). A cumulative count would typically be specified more explicitly, for example, \"the total number of stars with parallax greater than plx\". For a uniform star distribution, it is a known result that dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx^4. The problem presents a similar, but slightly different, power law.\n\n3.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks \"How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\". This is asking for the quantity dN/dr.\n\n4.  **Relate the Variables:**\n    We need to find a relationship between dN/dr and dN/d(plx). We can do this using the chain rule from calculus:\n    dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n\n5.  **Find the Necessary Derivative:**\n    We need to find the derivative of parallax (plx) with respect to distance (r). The fundamental relationship between parallax and distance is:\n    plx = 1/r = r⁻¹\n\n    Now, we differentiate plx with respect to r:\n    d(plx)/dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n\n6.  **Combine the Pieces:**\n    Now substitute the given information and the derivative we just calculated into the chain rule equation:\n    dN/dr ~ (1/plx^5) * (-1/r²)\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (r):**\n    The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. To find the final relationship with `r`, we must replace `plx` with its equivalent in terms of `r` (plx = 1/r):\n    dN/dr ~ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ~ (r^5) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ~ -r^(5-2)\n    dN/dr ~ -r³\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The result shows that the number of stars per unit distance, dN/dr, is proportional to r³. The negative sign is a result of the inverse relationship between parallax and distance and can be ignored when considering only the proportionality of the magnitudes.\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as r³.\n\n    This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
