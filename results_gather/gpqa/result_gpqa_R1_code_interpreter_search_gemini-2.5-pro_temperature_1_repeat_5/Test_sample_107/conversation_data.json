    "The user wants to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy with a specific electronic transition energy in a Hydrogen atom.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term, also known as the Zeeman effect, describes the interaction of an atom's magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. The energy shift is given by:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\cdot \\mu_B \\cdot B$\n\nwhere:\n*   $m$ is the magnetic quantum number. The problem states that $m$ has a small value, so we can take $m=1$ to evaluate the order of magnitude.\n*   $B$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field, given as $B = 1$ T.\n*   $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, a fundamental physical constant. Its value is $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5}$ eV/T.\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = 1 \\cdot (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\cdot (1 \\text{ T})$\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n\n### 2. Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)\n\nThe problem provides the wavelength ($\\lambda$) of the photon associated with the transition:\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$\n\nThis wavelength corresponds to the Balmer series ($n_f=2$) in the Hydrogen spectrum, specifically the transition from $n_i=4$ to $n_f=2$.\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $h$ is the Planck constant ($4.136 \\times 10^{-15}$ eV·s).\n*   $c$ is the speed of light ($3.00 \\times 10^8$ m/s).\n*   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength ($0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}$ m).\n\nA useful combination is the product $hc$, which is approximately $1240$ eV·nm.\nFirst, convert the wavelength to nanometers:\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m} = 486.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$\n\nNow, calculate the transition energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV·nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\n### 3. Compare the Magnitudes\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nLet's find the ratio between them:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.55 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is very small, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
