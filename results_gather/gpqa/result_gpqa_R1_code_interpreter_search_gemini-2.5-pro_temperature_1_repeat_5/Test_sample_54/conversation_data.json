    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet means there are no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group in an acetate ester (CH3-C(=O)O-). This strongly suggests the presence of an acetate group in the molecule. All four options are acetate esters, so this is consistent.\n\n*   **Remaining signals: 7.0 ppm (1H), 5.5 ppm (1H), 1.6 ppm (3H).**\n    *   The total integration for these signals is 1H + 1H + 3H = 5 protons.\n    *   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) has 1+1+3 = 5 protons.\n    *   A butenyl group (-CH=CH-CH2-CH3) has 1+1+2+3 = 7 protons.\n    *   Since the remaining protons sum to 5, the unknown compound must have a propenyl group, not a butenyl group. This allows us to eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and D).\n\n**2. Differentiate between Cis- and Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n\n*   We are now choosing between A) Cis-propenyl acetate and C) Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to distinguishing between cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two protons on the double bond (vinyl protons).\n    *   **Cis coupling (J_cis):** Typically ranges from 6 to 12 Hz.\n    *   **Trans coupling (J_trans):** Typically ranges from 12 to 18 Hz.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   This signal represents one of the vinyl protons.\n    *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to only one other proton (the other vinyl proton).\n    *   The coupling constant is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value is large and falls squarely in the range for *trans* coupling. This indicates a *trans* configuration for the double bond.\n\n**3. Confirm the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n\nLet's assign all the signals to the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:\n**CH3(a)-C(=O)O-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH3(d)** (with H(b) and H(c) being trans)\n\n*   **Signal (a) - Acetate methyl:** No adjacent protons. This corresponds to the singlet at **2.1 ppm**. (Matches)\n*   **Signal (d) - Vinylic methyl:** This CH3 group is adjacent to one proton, H(c). It should be a doublet. This corresponds to the doublet at **1.6 ppm**. (Matches)\n*   **Signal (b) - Vinyl proton:** This proton is adjacent to the oxygen atom, which deshields it, moving it far downfield. It is coupled to one proton, H(c), in a *trans* arrangement. This corresponds to the doublet with a large J-value at **7.0 ppm (J = 16.0 Hz)**. (Matches)\n*   **Signal (c) - Vinyl proton:** This proton is coupled to H(b) (which splits it into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (d) (which splits it into a quartet). The resulting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This corresponds to the signal at **5.5 ppm (dq)**. (Matches)\n\nAll features of the 1H NMR spectrum are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe presence of a propenyl group (eliminating B and D) and the large coupling constant of J = 16.0 Hz (indicating a *trans* double bond) definitively identifies the compound as Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
