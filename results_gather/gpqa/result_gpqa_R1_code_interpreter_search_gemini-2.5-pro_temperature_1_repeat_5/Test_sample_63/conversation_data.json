    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental results to identify the products of the decomposition.**\n    *   The initial sample is a 7.20 g equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B.\n    *   Heating this mixture produces only gases.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ (by forming a CaCO₃ precipitate). The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means **no CO₂ was produced**. This is a critical clue that the salts do not contain carbonate ions.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n        *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining gas C:** After passing through all the tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. The most common unreactive gas produced from the decomposition of salts is nitrogen (N₂). Let's assume gas C is N₂.\n\n2.  **Verify the Law of Conservation of Mass and the identity of Gas C.**\n    *   Let's calculate the total mass of the gaseous products we've identified:\n        *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n        *   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * (2 * 16.00 g/mol) = 0.80 g\n        *   Mass of N₂ (assuming C is N₂) = 0.10 mol * (2 * 14.01 g/mol) = 2.80 g\n        *   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This total mass exactly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identification of the products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) and their quantities is correct.\n\n3.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n    *   The elements in the products (H, O, N) must have come from the original salts A and B.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 * (moles of H₂O) = 2 * 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles of N = 2 * (moles of N₂) = 2 * 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O in O₂) = (0.20 mol) + (2 * 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   The molar ratio of the elements in the total mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   To get an integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest number (0.20): N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25.\n    *   To make all numbers integers, we multiply the ratio by 4: N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n    *   So, the combined empirical formula for the equimolar mixture (one unit of A + one unit of B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n4.  **Identify the individual salts A and B.**\n    *   We need to find two common nitrogen-hydrogen-oxygen salts that, when added together, give the formula N₄H₈O₅.\n    *   Let's consider common salts:\n        *   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ → Formula: N₂H₄O₃\n        *   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → Formula: N₂H₄O₂\n    *   Let's see if these two add up to our target formula:\n        *   (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅.\n    *   This is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n5.  **(Optional verification) Check the decomposition reactions.**\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrite is: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate can vary with temperature. A known reaction at higher temperatures is: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). This can be written per mole as: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂(g) + 0.5O₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n    *   The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's say we have 'n' moles of each salt.\n        *   Products from n moles of NH₄NO₃: n mol N₂, 0.5n mol O₂, 2n mol H₂O\n        *   Products from n moles of NH₄NO₂: n mol N₂, 2n mol H₂O\n    *   Total products: (n+n) mol N₂, 0.5n mol O₂, (2n+2n) mol H₂O = 2n mol N₂, 0.5n mol O₂, 4n mol H₂O.\n    *   The ratio of products is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 2n : 0.5n : 4n = 4 : 1 : 8.\n    *   Our experimental moles are: N₂ = 0.10 mol, O₂ = 0.025 mol, H₂O = 0.20 mol.\n    *   The experimental ratio is 0.10 : 0.025 : 0.20. Dividing by 0.025 gives the ratio 4 : 1 : 8.\n    *   The ratios match perfectly, confirming our identification of the salts and their reactions.\n\n6.  **Answer the question.**\n    *   The question asks for the **total number of all atoms in salts A and B**. This means the sum of atoms in the formula unit of each salt.\n    *   Salt A: NH₄NO₃. Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n    *   Salt B: NH₄NO₂. Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 2 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n```python\n# Final verification of the atom count\n# Salt A: NH4NO3\natoms_A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3\n# Salt B: NH4NO2\natoms_B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2\n\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(f\"Total atoms in NH4NO3 and NH4NO2 is: {total_atoms}\")\n```",
    "The final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Number of Nitrogen atoms = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen atoms = 3\n    *   Total atoms in Salt A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n    *   Number of Nitrogen atoms = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen atoms = 2\n    *   Total atoms in Salt B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each salt:\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n<<<B>>>"
