    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), which is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). The α-carbons are C-2 and C-6.\n    *   C-2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group attached, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C-6 has a methyl group and one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the proton from C-6 to form the enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate formed at C-6 attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the attack and subsequent protonation (during workup), the ethyl acrylate moiety becomes a -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt group attached to C-6.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has the cyclohexanone core with its original substituents, plus the new group at C-6.\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexanone ring with:\n        *   An oxo (=O) group at C-1.\n        *   An ethyl and a methyl group at C-2.\n        *   A methyl group and a -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt group at C-6.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options provided name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. This means the `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` part is treated as the parent chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C-6).\n        *   **C-1' (attachment point):** Has a methyl group.\n        *   **C-2' (original C-1):** Has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   **C-3' (original C-2):** Has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction. The α-protons of a nitroalkane are acidic and can be removed by a base like KOH to form a nitronate anion, which is a potent carbon nucleophile. This nucleophile then attacks the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation:**\n    *   The nitroalkane is 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   The base (KOH) removes a proton from the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group), which is C-1.\n    *   This forms the nucleophilic nitronate anion: [CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile (C-3 of the butene chain).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C-1 of the 1-nitropropane and C-3 of the but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The nitropropane fragment is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-`.\n    *   The butenenitrile fragment, after attack and protonation by water, is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Combining these fragments gives the final product:\n        ```\n             NO₂\n             |\n        CH₃-CH₂-CH - CH-CH₂-CN\n                        |\n                        CH₃\n        ```\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so this is the basis of the name.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (C-1).\n    *   The chain is: CN(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃.\n    *   The parent chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C-3 and a **nitro** group at C-4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the full name of Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = correct, B = incorrect\n*   B) A = incorrect, B = correct\n*   C) A = incorrect, B = incorrect\n*   **D) A = correct, B = correct**\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
