    "This is a molecular biology problem that requires analyzing a DNA sequence to find an error.\n\n1.  **Identify the components of the engineered gene:** The problem describes a construct with an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag followed by the coding sequence for the GADD45G protein. The entire sequence should start with a start codon (ATG) and end just before a stop codon (in this case, the provided sequence ends with a stop codon, TGA).\n\n2.  **Analyze the provided DNA sequence:** Let's break down the 5' end of the sequence into codons (groups of three nucleotides).\n    *   `5' ATG...` : This is the universal start codon, coding for Methionine. The translation will correctly initiate here.\n    *   `...TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC...`: This part of the sequence codes for the HA tag. The peptide sequence for the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA.\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n        *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n        This sequence correctly codes for the YPYDVPDYA peptide. So, there is no missense mutation in the tag itself.\n\n3.  **Examine the sequence immediately following the HA tag:**\n    *   The sequence continues: `...TAC GCC AAA TGA CTCTGG...`\n    *   The codon after the HA tag sequence (`GCC`) is `AAA`. `AAA` codes for the amino acid Lysine.\n    *   The very next codon is `TGA`.\n\n4.  **Identify the significance of the TGA codon:** In the standard genetic code, `TGA` is one of the three stop codons (along with `TAA` and `TAG`). When the ribosome encounters a stop codon in the mRNA sequence (transcribed from the DNA), it does not insert an amino acid. Instead, release factors bind to the ribosome, causing the newly synthesized polypeptide chain to be released and terminating the translation process.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the consequence:** The presence of the `TGA` stop codon immediately after the HA tag and a single Lysine codon means that translation will halt at this point. The ribosome will produce only a very short peptide (Met-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-Lys) and will never translate the actual GADD45G coding sequence that follows. This directly explains why the full-length protein is not being expressed.\n\n6.  **Assess the given options:**\n    *   **A) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is precisely what happens due to the premature `TGA` stop codon. This is the correct explanation.\n    *   **B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can be important, their absence doesn't cause premature termination. It might affect folding or stability, but the primary problem here is that the full protein is never made in the first place.\n    *   **C) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect. Firstly, the problematic codon is TGA, not TAA. Secondly, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. Thirdly, the experiment is in hamster cells, not mouse cells (though the genetic code is the same).\n    *   **D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** As analyzed in step 2, the HA tag sequence correctly codes for the YPYDVPDYA peptide. There is no missense mutation.\n\nTherefore, the presence of a premature stop codon (`TGA`) is the reason for the failed protein expression.\n\n<<<A>>>"
