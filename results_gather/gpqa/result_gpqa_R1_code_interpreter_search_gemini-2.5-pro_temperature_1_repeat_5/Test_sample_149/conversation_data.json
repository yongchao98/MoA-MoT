    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a C=C or C=O double bond, or another ring).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule. This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons. Its chemical shift is typical for protons on a carbon adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like an aldehyde or an aromatic ring). The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates it's adjacent to a carbon with 1 proton (a CH group). This is consistent with the aldehyde proton, confirming the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring (an aniline derivative). The broadness is due to fast proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified, we have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. One substituent is the amino group (-NH2), and the other is the 2-oxoethyl group (-CH2-CHO).\n    The structure is 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal (also known as p-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2 + CHO = C8H(4+2+2+1)NO = C8H9NO. The structure matches the given formula and all NMR data.\n    Starting Material:\n     ![Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl) ethanal](https://i.imgur.com/8Qh1e4h.png)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is the standard procedure for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product after this step is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n     \n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    The diazonium salt is then treated with water. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group via a substitution reaction (hydrolysis), releasing nitrogen gas (N2). This reaction forms a phenol.\n    The product after this step is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (also known as p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n     ![Phenol Intermediate: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) ethanal](https://i.imgur.com/i9oF2vR.png)\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    The intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, is an aldehyde that possesses alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). When treated with a strong base (KOH) and heat, it undergoes a self-**aldol condensation**.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic alpha-proton to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n        The structure of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n         \n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction condition specifies \"Heat\". Heating the aldol addition product causes the elimination of a molecule of water (dehydration). The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This forms an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This dehydration is highly favorable because the resulting double bond is in conjugation with both the aldehyde's carbonyl group and the aromatic ring on C2, creating a very stable, extended conjugated system.\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n         \n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents (phenyl instead of hydroxyphenyl) and wrong double bond position.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; only has one hydroxyphenyl group.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product. This structure matches our derived final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
