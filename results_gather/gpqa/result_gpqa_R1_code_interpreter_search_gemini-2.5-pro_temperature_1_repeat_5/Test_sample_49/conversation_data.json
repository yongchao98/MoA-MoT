    "This problem requires interpreting a mathematical expression from a quantum field theory calculation to determine the number of loops in the corresponding Feynman diagram.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the number of loops, let's call it `L`, in a Feynman diagram.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Provided Information:** We are given a mathematical expression that represents a \"size estimate\" for the diagram's contribution:\n    `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Expression:** Let's break down the components of this expression based on standard practices in Quantum Field Theory (QFT):\n    *   `alpha` and `g`: These are coupling constants. Their powers (`alpha^3`, `g^2`) indicate the number and types of vertices in the diagram. Here, there are a total of `3 + 2 = 5` vertices.\n    *   `sqrt(2) * 8`: These are dimensionless numerical factors. They typically arise from symmetry factors of the diagram, traces over gamma matrices (in theories with fermions), or results of specific integrations. They do not directly determine the number of loops.\n    *   `(Q/M)^2`: This is a ratio of two energy scales, `Q` and `M`, squared. Such terms are common in QFT results, especially when calculating corrections or in effective field theories. `Q` might be a momentum transfer, and `M` could be a particle mass. This term tells us about the physics and kinematics but not the loop number itself.\n    *   `1/(4pi)^6`: This is the most crucial piece of information for determining the number of loops.\n\n4.  **The Loop Factor Convention:** In QFT calculations, particularly when using dimensional regularization in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop integral over an internal momentum (`∫ d^4k / (2π)^4`) systematically produces a factor of `1/(4π)^2` in the final amplitude. This factor arises from the integration over the angular part of the four-dimensional momentum space.\n    *   A diagram with 1 loop will have a factor of `(1/(4π)^2)^1 = 1/(4π)^2`.\n    *   A diagram with 2 loops will have a factor of `(1/(4π)^2)^2 = 1/(4π)^4`.\n    *   Following this pattern, a diagram with `L` loops will contain a factor of `(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Number of Loops (L):**\n    *   The expression given in the problem has a factor of `1/(4pi)^6`.\n    *   We can equate this with the general formula for `L` loops: `1/(4pi)^(2L) = 1/(4pi)^6`.\n    *   By comparing the exponents of the `(4pi)` term, we get the equation: `2L = 6`.\n    *   Solving for `L`, we find: `L = 6 / 2 = 3`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops. This corresponds to option C.\n\nThe reasoning is self-contained and relies on a standard convention in theoretical physics calculations. No complex computation or external search is necessary.\n\n<<<C>>>"
