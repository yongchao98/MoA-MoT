    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which states:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state. This can be thought of as the \"width\" or \"blurriness\" of the energy level.\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the quantum state (τ).\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, E1 and E2, their energy difference must be significantly larger than their respective energy uncertainties. A good rule of thumb is that the energy difference |E1 - E2| should be greater than the larger of the two energy uncertainties, ΔE1 or ΔE2.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state.**\n\nWe can approximate the minimum uncertainty ΔE as ħ/τ.\n\n*   **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\n    *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\n    *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Step 2: Determine the condition for resolution.**\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV). To resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than this larger uncertainty.\n\n|E1 - E2| > ΔE1\n|E1 - E2| > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**Step 3: Compare with the given options.**\n\nWe need to find the option that is greater than ~10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (Much smaller than 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV   (Smaller than 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV   (Much larger than 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV   (Much smaller than 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly option C (10⁻⁴ eV) provides an energy difference large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, as it is significantly greater than the energy broadening of the level with the shorter lifetime.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each level\ndelta_E1 = h_bar / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar / tau2\n\n# The required energy difference must be larger than the largest uncertainty.\n# The largest uncertainty comes from the shortest lifetime.\nrequired_separation = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (τ=10^-9 s): {delta_E1:.2e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (τ=10^-8 s): {delta_E2:.2e} eV\")\nprint(f\"To be resolved, the energy difference must be greater than {required_separation:.2e} eV.\")\n\n# Check the options\noptions = {'A': 1e-11, 'B': 1e-8, 'C': 1e-4, 'D': 1e-9}\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>",
