    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the baseline case.**\n    *   Option (a) describes a planet identical to Earth. We know Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. This will be our reference point.\n    *   Option (b) describes a planet with a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. This is essentially the same density as Earth.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the effect of mass on the density of a planet with constant composition.**\n    *   When a planet's mass increases, its gravity also increases.\n    *   This stronger gravity pulls all the material of the planet closer together, compressing it.\n    *   For a planet with the same composition (e.g., the same ratio of iron, silicates, etc., as Earth), this gravitational compression means that a more massive planet will be denser. Conversely, a less massive planet will be less compressed and therefore less dense.\n\n*   **Step 3: Apply this understanding to options (c) and (d).**\n    *   Option (c) describes a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass. Due to the increased mass, it will be significantly more compressed by its own gravity. Therefore, its density will be greater than Earth's density (> 5.51 g/cm³).\n    *   Option (d) describes a planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass. Due to the decreased mass, it will be less compressed by its own gravity. Therefore, its density will be less than Earth's density (< 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare the densities of all four options.**\n    *   a) Density ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   b) Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   c) Density > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to higher mass and compression)\n    *   d) Density < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lower mass and less compression)\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude which planet has the highest density.**\n    *   By comparing the four options, the planet in option (c) is the only one that is guaranteed to have a density significantly higher than Earth's. Therefore, it has the highest density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
