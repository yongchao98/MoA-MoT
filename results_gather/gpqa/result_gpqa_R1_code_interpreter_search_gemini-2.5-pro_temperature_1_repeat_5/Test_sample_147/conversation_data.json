    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (formula YF_n), and the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    Where M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n    We can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    M(Y) = M(F) * n * (1/ɷF - 1)\n    M(Y) = 19.00 * n * (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    M(Y) = 19.00 * n * (3.1289 - 1)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now, we test integer values for n (the number of fluorine atoms):\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Ca, Ar, K - none form 5+ fluorides)\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest is Br, Se - BrF, BrF3, BrF5 known. Kr is 83.8 g/mol)\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (closest is Sb, M=121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (closest is Dy, Tb)\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (closest is Hg, Tl)\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (closest is Am, Pu)\n\n2.  **Evaluate the best candidates for Y.**\n    *   **Hypothesis 1: Y = Antimony (Sb).** If n=3, M(Y) is ~121.35 g/mol, which is an excellent match for Antimony's molar mass (121.76 g/mol).\n        Let's check the mass percentage for A2 = SbF₃:\n        ɷF(SbF₃) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n        This is extremely close to the given 31.96%, making Sb a very strong candidate.\n    *   **Hypothesis 2: Y = Krypton (Kr).** If n=2, M(Y) is ~80.9 g/mol. Krypton's mass is 83.8 g/mol.\n        Let's check the mass percentage for A2 = KrF₂:\n        ɷF(KrF₂) = (2 * 19.00) / (83.8 + 2 * 19.00) = 38 / 121.8 = 0.3120 or 31.20%.\n        This value is also close to 31.96%, but the match for Sb is significantly better.\n\n3.  **Test the Antimony (Sb) hypothesis against the other clues.**\n    *   Y = Sb, A2 = SbF₃.\n    *   \"A1 decomposes ... into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine.\" This implies A1 is SbF₅ (SbF₅ -> SbF₃ + F₂). However, SbF₅ is very stable and is synthesized from SbF₃ and F₂, it does not decompose this way. This is a major contradiction.\n    *   \"A1 is a bright-red substance.\" SbF₅ is a colorless liquid. This is another major contradiction.\n    *   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y\". Sb + F₂ -> SbF₅. So A3 = SbF₅. This is correct.\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" SbF₅ is a powerful Lewis acid and oxidizer that reacts with xenon. This is correct.\n    *   \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to ... A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This means Sb + A4 -> A5 (1:1). If A4 is SbF₅, the known comproportionation reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃, which is not a 1:1 ratio. No other common reaction fits this 1:1 stoichiometry.\n    *   The antimony hypothesis, despite the excellent mass percentage match, leads to multiple strong contradictions.\n\n4.  **Test the Krypton (Kr) hypothesis.**\n    Although the mass % match is not perfect, let's see if the other clues provide a more consistent picture. Such problems can sometimes contain minor numerical errors.\n    *   Y = Kr, A2 = KrF₂.\n    *   \"A1 decomposes ... into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine.\" This means A1 = KrF₄. The reaction KrF₄ -> KrF₂ + F₂ is known to occur as KrF₄ is unstable. This fits.\n    *   \"A1 is a bright-red substance.\" KrF₄ is reported as a white solid. This is a contradiction.\n    *   \"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\" KrF₄ would be a very strong oxidizing agent, stronger than KrF₂. Plausible.\n    *   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y\". Kr + F₂ -> KrF₂. So A3 = KrF₂. This is correct.\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" KrF₂ reacts with xenon (KrF₂ + Xe -> XeF₂ + Kr). This fits.\n    *   \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to ... A4, A5 can be obtained.\" Let's assume the compounds are not all distinct. If A4=A1=KrF₄, the reaction would be:\n        **Kr + KrF₄ -> 2KrF₂**\n        This reaction is a comproportionation. Crucially, the reactants Kr (Y) and KrF₄ (A4) are in a **1:1 molar ratio**. The product A5 would be KrF₂. This fits the clue perfectly.\n    *   \"Five binary compounds... are known.\" This is a major issue for Krypton, as only KrF₂ is well-established, and KrF₄ is debatable. This seems to be an error in the problem statement.\n    *   \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" A5 = KrF₂. Hydrolysis of KrF₂ gives Kr, HF, and O₂ (three substances). This is another contradiction.\n\n5.  **Compare the hypotheses and conclude.**\n    The Antimony (Sb) case has a perfect numerical match but fails on several key chemical reactions and properties. The 1:1 reaction seems impossible to satisfy.\n    The Krypton (Kr) case has a slightly imperfect numerical match and contradicts some descriptive facts (color, number of compounds, hydrolysis products). However, it provides a perfect and elegant explanation for the stoichiometric clues, particularly the 1:1 reaction (Kr + KrF₄). In complex chemistry problems, stoichiometric evidence often outweighs descriptive details which might be simplified or contain errors. The 1:1 reaction is a very strong pointer towards the Krypton hypothesis.\n\n6.  **Determine the molecular weight of A4.**\n    Based on the more consistent Krypton hypothesis, the compound A4 is KrF₄.\n    Let's calculate its molecular weight.\n    ```python\n    # Molar mass of Krypton (Kr)\n    M_Kr = 83.798  # g/mol\n    # Molar mass of Fluorine (F)\n    M_F = 18.9984 # g/mol\n    # Molecular weight of KrF4\n    M_KrF4 = M_Kr + 4 * M_F\n    print(M_KrF4)\n    ```\n    159.7916\n\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 (KrF₄) is approximately 159.8 g/mol.\n    Now, we check which range this value falls into:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 110-130\n\n    The value 159.8 g/mol falls within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<A>>>"
