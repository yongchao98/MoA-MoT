    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 ($L_1$) to that of Star 2 ($L_2$), which is the value of $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\cdot \\sigma T^4$\n    where $A$ is the surface area of the star ($A = 4\\pi R^2$ for a sphere), $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the surface temperature of the star.\n    So, $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the formula from the previous step, we can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars as:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Radius Information:** The problem states that the radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2:\n    $R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2 \\implies R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$\n    Substituting this into our ratio equation gives:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\cdot (T_1 / T_2)^4 = 2.25 \\cdot (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the wavelength at which its *emitted* radiation is most intense ($\\lambda_{emitted, max}$):\n        $T = b / \\lambda_{emitted, max}$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n        This means the temperature ratio is inversely related to the ratio of their emitted peak wavelengths:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} / \\lambda_{emitted, max, 1}$\n\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the wavelength at which the stars *appeared* brightest is the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs, max}$), which can be affected by the star's motion relative to the observer (Doppler effect). The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity and $c$ is the speed of light. (This is the non-relativistic approximation, which is highly accurate for $v_r \\ll c$).\n\n    *   **Applying the Data:**\n        - For Star 1, $v_{r1} = 0$, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs, max, 1} = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 1}$.\n        - For Star 2, $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. Its observed wavelength is redshifted: $\\lambda_{obs, max, 2} = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n        - The problem states $\\lambda_{obs, max, 1} = \\lambda_{obs, max, 2}$.\n        - Therefore, we can equate the expressions: $\\lambda_{emitted, max, 1} = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n\n    *   **Calculating the Temperature Ratio:**\n        - From the equation above, we find the ratio of emitted wavelengths:\n          $\\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} / \\lambda_{emitted, max, 1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n        - Since $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} / \\lambda_{emitted, max, 1}$, we have:\n          $T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \\cdot (1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c))^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)^4$\n\n    We are given:\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s = $700,000$ m/s\n    *   The speed of light, $c \\approx 299,792,458$ m/s\n\n    We can now compute the final value. The mass information is not needed for this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\nvr2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star 2 in m/s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# From the problem statement and physical laws, the luminosity ratio is:\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# And the temperature ratio considering the Doppler effect is:\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + vr2/c)\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2)**2 * (1 / (1 + vr2 / c))**4\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n\nThe code calculates the precise value of the luminosity ratio based on the derived formula. The output of the code is approximately 2.2291, which rounds to 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The code output is `2.229107561148499`.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n1.  The luminosity of a star ($L$) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $R$ is the radius, $T$ is the surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  The ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 and Star 2 is therefore:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$.\n3.  We are given that $R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n4.  Wien's Displacement Law states that the temperature of a star is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation ($\\lambda_{emitted, max}$): $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emitted, max}$. Therefore, $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} / \\lambda_{emitted, max, 1}$.\n5.  The observed peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs, max}$) is affected by the Doppler effect due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$): $\\lambda_{obs, max} = \\lambda_{emitted, max} (1 + v_r/c)$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n6.  The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: $\\lambda_{obs, max, 1} = \\lambda_{obs, max, 2}$.\n7.  For Star 1, $v_{r1} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{obs, max, 1} = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 1}$.\n8.  For Star 2, $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s, so $\\lambda_{obs, max, 2} = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n9.  Equating the observed wavelengths: $\\lambda_{emitted, max, 1} = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n10. Rearranging this to find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation: $\\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} / \\lambda_{emitted, max, 1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n11. Therefore, the temperature ratio is $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n12. Substituting this back into the luminosity ratio equation: $L_1/L_2 = 2.25 \\cdot (1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c))^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)^4$.\n13. The Python code calculated this value using $v_{r2} = 700,000$ m/s and $c = 299,792,458$ m/s.\n14. The result is `2.2291...`, which rounds to `2.23`. This matches option A. The information about the mass is irrelevant to this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
