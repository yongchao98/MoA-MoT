    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substances X, Y, W, G, and B.**\n\n    *   **Gas W:** The problem states that gas W has a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's analyze common gases:\n        *   H₂ (Protium): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect match.\n        *   Other gases like N₂ (14p, 14n), O₂ (16p, 16n), CO (14p, 14n) also fit this criterion, but the clue about a \"heavier isotope\" strongly points towards Deuterium (D). So, we can hypothesize **W = D₂**.\n\n    *   **Substance X and Reaction:** Substance X contains a \"heavier isotope,\" which we now suspect is Deuterium (D). It reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce D₂. A common violent reaction that produces hydrogen (or its isotope) is the reaction of a hydride with water.\n        *   The phrase \"X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n        *   The \"close analog\" containing a heavier isotope would be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n        *   To produce pure D₂ gas from LiAlD₄, the other reactant (liquid Y) must also be a source of deuterium atoms. The most common liquid that fits this is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   Let's check the reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`.\n        *   This reaction is analogous to the violent reaction of LiAlH₄ with H₂O. It produces D₂ gas (W). So, we can tentatively identify **Y = D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Precipitate G and Substance B:** The reaction produces a precipitate G. In the products `LiOD + Al(OD)₃`, LiOD is soluble, but Aluminium Deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃ (G)**, is insoluble, just like its analog Al(OH)₃.\n        *   G (Al(OD)₃) is heated and releases B. When Al(OH)₃ is heated, it decomposes: `2Al(OH)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O`.\n        *   By analogy, `2Al(OD)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. So, substance **B = D₂O** (heavy water).\n        *   The problem states the melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Let's convert this to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The actual melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is a very strong confirmation of our identifications.\n\n    *   **Confirmation with the Keto Acid Reaction:** The product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., Pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH).\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n        *   Ketone (>C=O) -> Secondary alcohol (>CHOH) (1 oxygen)\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) -> Primary alcohol (-CH₂OH) (1 oxygen)\n        *   The final product is a diol, which contains a total of 2 oxygen atoms. This matches the clue perfectly and rules out milder reagents like NaBD₄ (which wouldn't reduce the carboxylic acid).\n\n2.  **Final Identification of Substance X.**\n    Based on all the evidence, we can confidently conclude that **Substance X is LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation.**\n    The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n        *   Lightest element (by atomic number and mass): Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n        *   Heaviest element (by atomic number and mass): Aluminium (Al).\n\n    *   **Interpret the Calculation Instructions:** The question includes a critical clause: \"...considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n        *   This clause tells us how to calculate the mass contribution for each element.\n        *   For the lightest element (Hydrogen), there are **four instances** in the formula LiAlD₄. Therefore, we must sum the masses of all four Deuterium atoms.\n        *   For the heaviest element (Aluminium), there is only **one instance**.\n\n    *   **Calculate:** We will use integer mass numbers, as the options are integers.\n        *   Mass number of Deuterium (D or ²H) = 2.\n        *   Mass number of the main isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al) = 27.\n\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 × (mass of a D atom) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 × (mass of an Al atom) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n        *   Cumulative (summed) mass = (Total mass from H) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
