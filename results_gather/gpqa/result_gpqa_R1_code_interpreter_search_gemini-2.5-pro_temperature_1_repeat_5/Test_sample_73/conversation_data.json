    "This is a problem about conditional probability in the context of radioactive decay, which is a memoryless process.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Decay Law:**\n    The probability of a single atom surviving (not decaying) for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    `P(survival, t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n    The probability of the atom decaying within time `t` is:\n    `P(decay, t) = 1 - P(survival, t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find `λ`.\n    `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n    To solve for `λ`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n    `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\n    Let's compute the value of `λ`.\n    `ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857`\n    `λ ≈ -(-0.3857) / 100 ≈ 0.003857` per minute.\n\n3.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    Radioactive decay is a Poisson process, which is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\n\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is the same as finding the probability that a brand new atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    We use the decay formula with `t = 150` minutes and the value of `λ` we found.\n    `P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n    `P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-0.003857 * 150)`\n    `P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-0.57855)`\n\n    Now, we calculate the value:\n    `e^(-0.57855) ≈ 0.5607`\n    `P(decay, 150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This is closest to 44%.\n\nFor a more precise calculation without rounding intermediate steps:\n`P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^((-ln(0.68)/100) * 150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68)) = 1 - (e^ln(0.68))^1.5 = 1 - 0.68^1.5`\n\n```python\nimport math\n# Calculate the final probability directly\nprob = 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\nprint(f\"{prob:.4f}\")\n```\nThe calculation yields `0.4393`.\n\nThus, the probability is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Model the Radioactive Decay:**\n    Radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the formula:\n    `P(survival, t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant, a characteristic of the specific atom.\n\n    The probability that the atom decays *within* a time `t` is therefore:\n    `P(decay, t) = 1 - P(survival, t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find the value of `e^(-λ)`.\n    `P(decay, 100) = 0.32`\n    `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n    This value, `0.68`, represents the probability of the atom surviving for 100 minutes. We can use this relationship without explicitly solving for `λ`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    A key feature of exponential decay is that it is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of how much time has already passed. In this context, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has **no effect** on its probability of decaying in the future. The atom doesn't \"get old\" or \"wear out.\"\n\n    Therefore, the question \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has already survived 50 minutes?\" is equivalent to the simpler question: \"What is the probability a new atom will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    We need to find the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval, which is `P(decay, 150)`.\n    `P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n\n    We can find `e^(-150λ)` from the value we found in step 2:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^(150/100) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Substituting the value from step 2:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    Now, we can calculate the final decay probability:\n    `P(decay, 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    Using the code output:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    `P(decay, 150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is `0.4393`, or `43.93%`. This is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
