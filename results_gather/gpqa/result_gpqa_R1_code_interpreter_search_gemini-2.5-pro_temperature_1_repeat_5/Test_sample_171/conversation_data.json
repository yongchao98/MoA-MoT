    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium. Since the stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can use this equation.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle:** The distribution of atoms among different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution. For two energy levels, an excited state (let's call it state 2) and a ground state (state 1), the ratio of the number of atoms in these states is given by:\n    `N_2 / N_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-(E_2 - E_1) / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `N_2` and `N_1` are the number of atoms in the excited and ground states, respectively.\n    *   `g_2` and `g_1` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `E_2 - E_1` is the energy difference between the levels, which we'll call `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Interpret the problem statement:** The phrase \"iron atoms... are twice as excited\" compares the level of excitation in star_1 to that in star_2. A standard measure for the level of excitation is the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the number of atoms in the ground state (`N_2 / N_1`).\n    Let `R = N_2 / N_1`. The problem states that this ratio for star_1 is twice the ratio for star_2:\n    `R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n3.  **Apply the Boltzmann equation to each star:**\n    For star_1 (with temperature `T_1`):\n    `R_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n\n    For star_2 (with temperature `T_2`):\n    `R_2 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n4.  **Set up the equation based on the given ratio:**\n    Substitute the expressions for `R_1` and `R_2` into the relation `R_1 = 2 * R_2`:\n    `(g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for the statistical weights, `(g_2 / g_1)`, is the same for both stars as it relates to the specific energy levels of the iron atom, not the star. So, it cancels out:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n    Now, divide both sides by `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2`\n\n    Using the property of exponents `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n    `exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ) = 2`\n    `exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) + ΔE / (k * T_2) ) = 2`\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    `exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ) = 2`\n\n6.  **Solve for the temperatures:** Take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides to remove the exponential:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\n    Combine the terms in the parenthesis using a common denominator:\n    `1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\n    So the equation becomes:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n7.  **Use the given numerical values:** The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   The value of the Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\n    Calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n    The problem is set up so that this pre-factor `ΔE / k` simplifies to 1.\n\n8.  **Final Equation:** Substitute this value back into the equation:\n    `ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\nThis resulting equation matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
