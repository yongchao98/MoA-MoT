    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe have a system of two astronauts with different masses and relativistic speeds, both moving in the same direction. We need to calculate:\na) The relative speed (`v_rel`) between them.\nb) The total energy (`E_total`) of the system.\n\n**Given:**\n*   Mass of astronaut 1, `m1 = 2m`\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1, `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Mass of astronaut 2, `m2 = 3m`\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2, `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**2. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince both astronauts are moving in the same direction, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - (0.3 * c^2) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c`\n\nNow, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857... c`\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of a system is the sum of the individual energies of its components. The total energy of a single particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by:\n`E = γ * m_rest * c^2`\nwhere `m_rest` is the rest mass and `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is defined as:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)`\n\n**a) Energy of Astronaut 1 (E1):**\n*   `m1 = 2m`\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Calculate `γ1`:\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / 0.8`\n    `γ1 = 1.25`\n*   Calculate `E1`:\n    `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2`\n    `E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2`\n    `E1 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**b) Energy of Astronaut 2 (E2):**\n*   `m2 = 3m`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   Calculate `γ2`:\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n    `γ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866`\n    `γ2 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Calculate `E2`:\n    `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2`\n    `E2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2`\n    `E2 ≈ 3.4641 mc^2`\n\n**c) Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n*   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n*   `E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2`\n*   `E_total = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2`\n*   `E_total = 5.9641 mc^2`\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc^2**.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv1 = 0.6\nv2 = 0.5\nm1_factor = 2\nm2_factor = 3\n\n# --- Part 1: Relative Speed ---\n# Formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2)\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1 * v2)\nprint(f\"Relative speed in terms of c: {v_rel:.3f}\")\n\n# --- Part 2: Total Energy ---\n# Formula: E_total = (gamma1*m1 + gamma2*m2) * c^2\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2)\n\n# Gamma for astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\n# Energy for astronaut 1 in units of mc^2\nE1_factor = gamma1 * m1_factor\n\n# Gamma for astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\n# Energy for astronaut 2 in units of mc^2\nE2_factor = gamma2 * m2_factor\n\n# Total energy in units of mc^2\nE_total_factor = E1_factor + E2_factor\nprint(f\"Total energy in terms of mc^2: {E_total_factor:.3f}\")\n```\n> **Execution Output:**\n> Relative speed in terms of c: 0.143\n> Total energy in terms of mc^2: 5.964\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nOur calculated values are:\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`\n\nComparing these with the given options:\nA) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nB) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nC) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nOption D is the correct match.\n\n<<<D>>>",
