    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n\n2.  **Identify the First Substituent (Ester Group):**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, which has the general structure R-COO-R'.\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum provides a crucial clue: \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups.\" This rules out common ester types like ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3) or propyl esters, as they contain -CH2- groups.\n    *   The simplest ester that does not have a -CH2- group is a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n    *   The presence of a methyl ester is consistent with the 1H NMR data, which shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\". One of these signals would be from the methyl ester's -CH3 group.\n    *   So, the first substituent is a methyl ester group: **-COOCH3**. This fragment contains **2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Second Substituent:**\n    *   We need to account for the remaining signals in the 1H NMR spectrum. We have already accounted for one -CH3 signal. The remaining signals are:\n        *   Two signals for aromatic-H (these are on the C6H4 ring itself).\n        *   Two signals for vinyl-H (protons on a C=C double bond).\n        *   One more signal for a -CH3 group.\n    *   The vinyl-H signals are described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\". This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, specifically **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c).\n        *   The signal for H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the CH3(c) group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The signal for H(a) is split only by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   The signal for the CH3(c) group is split by H(b), resulting in a doublet. This accounts for the second -CH3 signal.\n    *   This -CH=CH-CH3 group perfectly matches the NMR description. This fragment contains **3 carbons and 5 hydrogens**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   Now, we combine all the identified parts of the molecule:\n        *   Aromatic ring: **C6H4**\n        *   First substituent (methyl ester): **C2H3O2** (from -COOCH3)\n        *   Second substituent (propenyl group): **C3H5** (from -CH=CH-CH3)\n    *   Sum the atoms from all fragments to find the total molecular formula:\n        *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 2 + 3 = 11\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 3 + 5 = 12\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
