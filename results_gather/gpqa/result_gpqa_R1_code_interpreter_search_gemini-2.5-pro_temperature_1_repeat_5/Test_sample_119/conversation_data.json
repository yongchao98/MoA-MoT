    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the key quantities:**\n    *   **Star Density (ρ):** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. This means the number of stars per unit volume, ρ, is constant everywhere in space.\n    *   **Distance (d):** The distance from the observer to a star.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position due to the Earth's orbit. It is inversely proportional to the distance. The relationship is `plx = 1/d` (where parallax is in arcseconds and distance is in parsecs).\n\n2.  **Count stars in a thin shell of space:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Since the star density (ρ) is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume.\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Relate the number of stars to parallax:**\n    *   The goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on parallax (`plx`).\n    *   We need to express `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   From `plx = 1/d`, we get `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When we are counting stars in a shell, we are only interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Substitute back into the star count equation:**\n    *   We start with our equation for the number of stars in the shell: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Now, substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` into this equation.\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit parallax:**\n    *   To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide `dN` by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
