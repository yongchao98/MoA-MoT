    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the surface defined by the given metric.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Metric and Area Element\n\nThe given metric is:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\nThis is a 2-dimensional metric of the form $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + 2g_{xy}dxdy + g_{yy}dy^2$.\nFrom the given expression, we can identify the components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$:\n$g_{xx} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n$g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n$g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\nThe metric tensor is:\n$g_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe area element $dA$ on the surface is given by the formula $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dx \\, dy$.\nFirst, we calculate the determinant of the metric tensor:\n$\\det(g_{ij}) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right) - 0^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, we take the square root to find the area element multiplier:\n$\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} = \\left| \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\right|$\n\n### 2. Determining the Domain of Integration\n\nThe problem asks for the area of the \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\". The metric becomes singular when the denominator is zero, i.e., when $4 - x^2 - y^2 = 0$, which is equivalent to $x^2 + y^2 = 4$. This is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin of the $(x, y)$ plane.\nThe metric is well-defined for $4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0$, which corresponds to the open disk $D$ defined by $x^2 + y^2 < 4$. The reference to \"radius r=2\" indicates that we should compute the area over this entire disk. Inside this disk, $4-x^2-y^2 > 0$, so the absolute value is not needed.\n\nThe area element is:\n$dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\nThe total area $A$ is the integral of this element over the disk $D$:\n$A = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Area Integral\n\nThis integral is best computed using polar coordinates. Let:\n$x = \\rho \\cos \\theta$\n$y = \\rho \\sin \\theta$\nThen $x^2 + y^2 = \\rho^2$, and the area element in the Cartesian plane is $dx \\, dy = \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$.\n\nThe domain of integration $D$ in polar coordinates is $0 \\le \\rho < 2$ and $0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$.\nSubstituting these into the area integral:\n$A = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^2 \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$\n\nFirst, we can integrate with respect to $\\theta$, as the integrand does not depend on it:\n$A = 2\\pi \\int_0^2 \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} d\\rho = 64\\pi \\int_0^2 \\frac{\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} d\\rho$\n\nThe integral with respect to $\\rho$ is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}$ approaches infinity as $\\rho \\to 2$. We evaluate it using a limit:\n$I = \\int_0^2 \\frac{\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} d\\rho = \\lim_{L \\to 2^-} \\int_0^L \\frac{\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} d\\rho$\n\nWe use the substitution $u = 4 - \\rho^2$. This gives $du = -2\\rho \\, d\\rho$, so $\\rho \\, d\\rho = -\\frac{1}{2}du$.\nThe limits of integration for $u$ are:\n- When $\\rho = 0$, $u = 4 - 0^2 = 4$.\n- When $\\rho = L$, $u = 4 - L^2$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$I = \\lim_{L \\to 2^-} \\int_4^{4-L^2} \\frac{1}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}du\\right) = \\lim_{L \\to 2^-} \\left[-\\frac{1}{2} \\ln|u|\\right]_4^{4-L^2}$\n$I = \\lim_{L \\to 2^-} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(4-L^2) - (-\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(4)) \\right)$\n$I = \\lim_{L \\to 2^-} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(4-L^2) + \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(4) \\right)$\n\nAs $L \\to 2^-$, the term $4-L^2$ approaches $0^+$. The natural logarithm $\\ln(x)$ approaches $-\\infty$ as $x \\to 0^+$.\nSo, $\\lim_{L \\to 2^-} \\ln(4-L^2) = -\\infty$.\n\nTherefore, the integral $I$ is:\n$I = -\\frac{1}{2}(-\\infty) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(4) = +\\infty$\n\nThe integral diverges to infinity. The total area is:\n$A = 64\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe calculated area is infinite. Let's review the given options:\nA) $+\\infty$\nB) $0$\nC) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)$\nD) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)$\n\nOptions C and D are not constant values but functions of coordinates, so they cannot represent the total area of the surface. Option B is 0, which is incorrect as the integrand is strictly positive over the domain. Option A, $+\\infty$, matches our calculation.\n\nFinal Answer should be given in LaTeX format.\nThe area is given by the integral:\n$A = \\iint_{x^2+y^2<4} \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\,dx\\,dy$\nUsing polar coordinates, $x=\\rho\\cos\\theta, y=\\rho\\sin\\theta, dx\\,dy = \\rho\\,d\\rho\\,d\\theta$:\n$A = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^2 \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\rho\\,d\\rho\\,d\\theta = 2\\pi \\int_0^2 \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}\\,d\\rho$\nLet $u=4-\\rho^2$, so $du = -2\\rho\\,d\\rho$.\n$A = 2\\pi \\int_{4}^{0} \\frac{32(-du/2)}{u} = -32\\pi \\int_4^0 \\frac{du}{u} = 32\\pi \\int_0^4 \\frac{du}{u}$\n$A = 32\\pi [\\ln|u|]_0^4 = 32\\pi (\\ln(4) - \\lim_{u\\to0^+} \\ln(u)) = 32\\pi(\\ln(4) - (-\\infty)) = +\\infty$\n\n<<<A>>>"
