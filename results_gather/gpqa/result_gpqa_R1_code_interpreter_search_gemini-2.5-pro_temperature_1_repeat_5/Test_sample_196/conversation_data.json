    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum of Compound X:**\n    *   A very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid carbonyl, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Compound X:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet far downfield is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents are electronically different, causing the adjacent protons to have different chemical shifts. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is likely for the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is for the protons ortho to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** Now let's piece together the structure of the alkyl substituent from the remaining signals.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-). Based on the triplet at 0.9 ppm, this -CH₂- group is adjacent to that -CH₃.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton suggests a methine group (-CH-). This proton is likely attached to the benzene ring and is coupled to several other protons.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:**\n        *   We have an ethyl fragment (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   We have a methine group (`-CH-`) with a methyl group attached (`-CH(CH₃)-`).\n        *   The methine proton at 2.9 ppm is deshielded, suggesting it's directly attached to the aromatic ring (a benzylic proton).\n        *   Let's connect the fragments to this methine carbon: it's bonded to the aromatic ring, the methyl group (from the 1.4 ppm doublet), and the ethyl group.\n        *   The full alkyl group is therefore: `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Compound X:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Compound X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para (position 4) position.\n    *   The structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option D.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Compound X).\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (Red P / HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Red P / HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH₃). The reaction is: R-COOH + 6HI --(Red P)--> R-CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂. The red phosphorus is used to regenerate HI from the I₂ formed.\n    *   **Product Prediction:** The carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group. The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n    *   The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, will be converted to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Final Product from the Options:**\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our predicted product.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nThe final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
