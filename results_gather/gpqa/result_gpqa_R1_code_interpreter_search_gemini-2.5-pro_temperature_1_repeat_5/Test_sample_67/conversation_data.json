    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin is described by the spin operator `S_vector = (S_x, S_y, S_z)`.\n    *   The magnetic moment is given by `μ_vector = γ * S_vector`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_initial_vector = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian for the system is `H = -μ_vector ⋅ B_vector`.\n    *   So, the initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = - (γ * S_vector) ⋅ (B * z_hat) = -γ * B * S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n    *   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γ * B * (ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γ * B * (ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming a positive gyromagnetic ratio (`γ > 0`), the lowest energy state is `E_up`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian for t > 0**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to `B_new_vector = B * y_hat` (pointing in the +Y direction).\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H_new = -μ_vector ⋅ B_new_vector = - (γ * S_vector) ⋅ (B * y_hat) = -γ * B * S_y`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution of the System**\n    The evolution of the expectation value of any operator `A` can be found using the Heisenberg equation of motion:\n    `d<A>/dt = (1/iħ) <[A, H]>`, where `<A>` is the expectation value of `A`.\n    We are interested in the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z> = γ<S_z>`. So we need to find the time evolution of `<S_z>`.\n\n    Let's apply the Heisenberg equation to the components of the spin operator `S` with the new Hamiltonian `H = -γBS_y`:\n    *   `d<S_z>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S_z, H]> = (1/iħ) <[S_z, -γBS_y]> = (-γB/iħ) <[S_z, S_y]>`\n        Using the commutation relation `[S_z, S_y] = -iħS_x`, we get:\n        `d<S_z>/dt = (-γB/iħ) (-iħ<S_x>) = γB<S_x>` (Equation 1)\n\n    *   Now we need to find how `<S_x>` evolves:\n        `d<S_x>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S_x, H]> = (1/iħ) <[S_x, -γBS_y]> = (-γB/iħ) <[S_x, S_y]>`\n        Using the commutation relation `[S_x, S_y] = iħS_z`, we get:\n        `d<S_x>/dt = (-γB/iħ) (iħ<S_z>) = -γB<S_z>` (Equation 2)\n\n4.  **Solve the Coupled Differential Equations**\n    We have a system of two coupled first-order differential equations:\n    1.  `d<S_z>/dt = γB<S_x>`\n    2.  `d<S_x>/dt = -γB<S_z>`\n\n    To solve this, we can differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * d<S_x>/dt`\n\n    Now, substitute the second equation into this new equation:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * (-γB<S_z>) = -(γB)² <S_z>`\n\n    This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`.\n    By comparing the two equations, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation `ω`.\n\n    `ω² = (γB)²`\n    `ω = γB` (assuming `γ` and `B` are positive).\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<S_z>`, oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n    Since the magnetic moment's z-component is directly proportional to the spin's z-component (`<μ_z> = γ<S_z>`), it will oscillate with the same frequency. This frequency, `ω = γB`, is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\n    Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n    B) gamma*B\n    C) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n    D) gamma*B/2\n\n    The calculated frequency matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
