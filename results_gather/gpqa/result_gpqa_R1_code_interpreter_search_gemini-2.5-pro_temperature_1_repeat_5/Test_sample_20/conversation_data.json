    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers (called tautomers) that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton (H+) and a shift in a double bond. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, where a molecule containing a carbonyl group (keto form) is in equilibrium with its enol form (a molecule containing a hydroxyl group bonded to a carbon that is part of a C=C double bond).\n\n    2.  A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen**. This is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group. This alpha-carbon must typically be sp³ hybridized.\n\n    3.  Let's examine **benzoquinone** (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone).\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite positions (1 and 4) and two C=C double bonds.\n        *   Alpha-carbons: The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n        *   Alpha-hydrogens: Each of these alpha-carbons is part of a C=C double bond (they are sp² hybridized) and is bonded to one hydrogen atom. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized carbon, benzoquinone cannot undergo the typical keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    4.  Now let's examine **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered saturated ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups.\n        *   Alpha-carbons: The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha to two carbonyl groups.\n        *   Alpha-hydrogens: Each of these alpha-carbons is sp³ hybridized and has two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are highly acidic because the negative charge of the resulting carbanion (enolate) can be delocalized over two carbonyl groups.\n        *   This compound readily undergoes tautomerism. In fact, it exists almost exclusively in its aromatic enol form, **phloroglucinol** (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is much more stable.\n        *   Keto form (Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) ⇌ Enol form (Phloroglucinol)\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n    5.  **Conclusion for A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable on the original molecule. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    2.  Let's examine **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n        *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n        *   Let's analyze the carbon at position 2 (the one with the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n            1.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n    3.  Now let's examine **dimethyl fumarate**.\n        *   Structure: It is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   The molecule is planar. It has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n        *   Alternatively, there are no chiral centers in the molecule (no carbon is bonded to four different groups).\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation**\n    *   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This matches the pair: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
