    "An isolated system consists of 13 identical particles. Each particle has a charge of `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge. The mass of the particles is negligible.\n\nThe system is configured as follows:\n- One particle is fixed at a point P. Let's call this the central charge, `q_c`.\n- The other 12 particles are constrained to stay on the surface of a sphere with a radius `R = 2 m`, centered at P.\n\nWe need to find the minimum potential energy of this system. The total potential energy `E_total` of this system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. The energy can be divided into two components:\n1.  `E_interaction`: The potential energy due to the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  `E_sphere`: The potential energy due to the interaction among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\nThe total minimum energy is `E_total = E_interaction + E_sphere_min`.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the interaction energy `E_interaction`\n\nThe central charge `q_c = 2e` is at point P. The 12 charges on the sphere, `q_i = 2e` (for i=1 to 12), are all at a fixed distance `R = 2 m` from P.\n\nThe potential energy between the central charge and a single charge on the sphere is:\n`U_single = k * (q_c * q_i) / R = k * (2e * 2e) / R = k * (4e^2) / R`\nwhere `k` is Coulomb's constant (`~8.98755 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2`).\n\nSince there are 12 such charges on the sphere, the total interaction energy is:\n`E_interaction = 12 * U_single = 12 * k * (4e^2) / R = 48 * k * e^2 / R`\n\nThis energy component is fixed, regardless of how the 12 charges are arranged on the sphere's surface.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the minimum sphere energy `E_sphere_min`\n\nThe 12 identical charges on the surface of the sphere will repel each other and arrange themselves to minimize their mutual potential energy. This is a classic physics problem known as the Thomson problem. For N=12 charges, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron inscribed within the sphere.\n\nThe potential energy `E_sphere` is the sum of the potential energies for all pairs of charges on the sphere. The number of pairs is `12 * 11 / 2 = 66`.\n`E_sphere = sum_{i<j} k * (q_i * q_j) / r_ij = k * (2e)^2 * sum_{i<j} (1 / r_ij) = 4 * k * e^2 * sum_{i<j} (1 / r_ij)`\n\nTo calculate the sum of inverse distances `sum(1/r_ij)`, we need to know the distances between the vertices of the icosahedron. There are three distinct distances between any two vertices:\n1.  The edge length `a`. There are 30 edges, so 30 pairs are at this distance.\n2.  The short diagonal `d`. There are 30 such diagonals.\n3.  The diameter of the sphere `2R`. There are `12/2 = 6` pairs of antipodal vertices.\n\nThe edge length `a` of a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `R` is given by the formula:\n`a = 4R / sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5))`\n\nThe diagonal distance `d` is related to the edge length `a` by the golden ratio `phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2`:\n`d = a * phi`\n\nSo, the sum of inverse distances is:\n`sum_{i<j} (1 / r_ij) = 30/a + 30/(a*phi) + 6/(2R) = 30/a + 30/(a*phi) + 3/R`\n\nTherefore, the minimum sphere energy is:\n`E_sphere_min = 4 * k * e^2 * (30/a + 30/(a*phi) + 3/R)`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total minimum energy\n\n`E_total = E_interaction + E_sphere_min`\n`E_total = (48 * k * e^2 / R) + 4 * k * e^2 * (30/a + 30/(a*phi) + 3/R)`\n\nWe can now use a Python script to compute the numerical value with high precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants\nk = 8.9875517923e9  # Coulomb's constant (N m^2 C^-2)\ne = 1.602176634e-19   # Elementary charge (C)\n\n# Define the parameters of the system\nR = 2.0               # Radius of the sphere (m)\nq = 2 * e             # Charge of each particle (C)\nN_sphere = 12         # Number of particles on the sphere\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 sphere charges\nE_interaction = N_sphere * k * q**2 / R\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the minimum potential energy of the 12 charges on the sphere\n# The charges form a regular icosahedron.\n\n# Calculate the golden ratio\nphi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2\n\n# Calculate the edge length 'a' of the icosahedron inscribed in the sphere of radius R\na = 4 * R / math.sqrt(10 + 2 * math.sqrt(5))\n\n# The distances between pairs of vertices are a, a*phi, and 2R.\n# Number of pairs at distance 'a' (edges) = 30\n# Number of pairs at distance '2R' (antipodal) = 6\n# Number of pairs at distance 'a*phi' (diagonals) = 30\n# Total pairs = 30 + 6 + 30 = 66, which matches N*(N-1)/2 = 12*11/2 = 66.\n\n# Sum of inverse distances for all pairs on the sphere\nsum_inv_dist = 30/a + 30/(a * phi) + 6/(2 * R)\n\n# Calculate the sphere energy\nE_sphere_min = k * q**2 * sum_inv_dist\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total minimum energy of the system\nE_total = E_interaction + E_sphere_min\n\nprint(f\"{E_total:.3e}\")\n```\n>>>\n2.822e-26\n\n<<<C>>>",
