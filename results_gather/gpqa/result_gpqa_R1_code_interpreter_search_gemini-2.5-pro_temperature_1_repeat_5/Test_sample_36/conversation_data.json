    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, E.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n*   **Reactants:** Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) and Ethanedithiol (HSCH₂CH₂SH, abbreviated as EDT).\n*   **Catalyst:** BF₃ (a Lewis acid).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the protection of an aldehyde using a dithiol to form a cyclic dithioacetal. The carbonyl oxygen is replaced by two sulfur atoms from ethanedithiol, forming a 1,3-dithiane ring.\n*   **Product A:** The product is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane. The carbon that was the aldehyde carbon (C2 of the dithiane ring) is attached to an ethyl group.\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n*   **Reactants:** A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane) and Butyllithium (BuLi).\n*   **Reaction:** BuLi is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton on the carbon atom between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent sulfur atoms. This type of reaction, creating a nucleophilic acyl anion equivalent, is known as the Corey-Seebach reaction (an example of umpolung).\n*   **Product B:** The product is a lithiated carbanion, specifically the lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane anion.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n*   **Reactants:** B (the lithiated carbanion) and Bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br).\n*   **Reaction:** The carbanion (B) is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This step adds a second ethyl group to the C2 position of the dithiane ring.\n*   **Product C:** The product is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n*   **Reactants:** C (2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane) and reagents for deprotection (HgCl₂, H₂O, H⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** These reagents are used to hydrolyze the dithioacetal, removing the protecting group and regenerating a carbonyl group. The Hg²⁺ ion has a high affinity for sulfur, facilitating the cleavage of the C-S bonds.\n*   **Product D:** Since the original C2 carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the resulting carbonyl compound is a ketone with two ethyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. This is 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n*   **Reactants:** D (3-pentanone), Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), and Butyllithium (BuLi).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Wittig reaction. The reaction proceeds in two stages:\n    1.  **Ylide formation:** Triphenylphosphine reacts with the alkyl halide (3-bromopentane) to form a phosphonium salt. BuLi then deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus atom to form a phosphorus ylide.\n        *   PPh₃ + (CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr → [(CH₃CH₂)₂CH-P⁺Ph₃]Br⁻\n        *   [(CH₃CH₂)₂CH-P⁺Ph₃]Br⁻ + BuLi → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ (the ylide)\n    2.  **Wittig reaction:** The ylide reacts with the ketone (D, 3-pentanone). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide, forming a C=C double bond.\n        *   (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₃CH₂)₂ + Ph₃P=O\n*   **Product E:** The final product is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. Its structure is (Et)₂C=C(Et)₂, where Et represents an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Analysis of the 13C-NMR Spectrum of E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene)**\n\nThe structure of E is:\n```\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n```\n\nThis molecule is highly symmetrical. We can identify the chemically equivalent carbons to determine the number of distinct signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** There is a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C double bond. This makes the two carbons of the double bond chemically equivalent. This will produce **one signal**.\n2.  **Ethyl Group Carbons:** The molecule has four identical ethyl groups attached to the double bond. Due to the high degree of symmetry (including a C₂ axis perpendicular to the C=C bond), all four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** Within the four equivalent ethyl groups, the four methylene (-CH₂-) carbons are all chemically equivalent to each other. This will produce **one signal**.\n    *   **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four methyl (-CH₃) carbons are all chemically equivalent to each other. This will produce **one signal**.\n\nIn total, we have three sets of chemically equivalent carbons:\n*   The two sp² carbons of the alkene.\n*   The four sp³ methylene carbons.\n*   The four sp³ methyl carbons.\n\nTherefore, the final product E will produce **3 signals** in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 8\nB) 6\nC) 11\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
