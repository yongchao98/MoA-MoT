    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone. The chemical formula is C7H14O2.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n    *   The molecule has one chiral center at carbon C5, and it is given as the pure (S) enantiomer.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride): This is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n    2.  Acidic workup (H3O+): This protonates the intermediate alkoxide to form the final alcohol product.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a *new* chiral center.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 remains in the (S) configuration.\n    *   The new chiral center at C3 can be either (R) or (S), as the hydride ion (H-) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face.\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        *   Product A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Since these two products have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S), they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a beta-diketone. The chemical formula is C5H8O2.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  Excess NaBH4 (Sodium borohydride): This is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n    2.  Acidic workup (H3O+): This protonates the intermediate alkoxides to form the final diol product.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   Starting from an achiral molecule with an achiral reagent, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S)/(2S, 4R).\n        *   Product C: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   Product D: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   Product E: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Products C and D are **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   Product E, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same molecule as (2R, 4S)).\n    *   The meso compound (E) is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomers (C and D).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different stereoisomers:\n1.  Product A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  Product B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  Product C: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  Product D: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  Product E: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nWe need to determine how many peaks are observed on two different types of HPLC columns.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase (achiral) column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (different connectivity, e.g., products from Rxn I vs. Rxn II) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated; they will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture:\n*   Products A and B are diastereomers. They will separate into **2 peaks**.\n*   Products C and D are enantiomers. They will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n*   Product E is a diastereomer of C and D. It will separate from the C/D pair, giving **1 peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (A and B) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C, D, and E), so they will all be well-separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from A and B) + 1 (from C+D) + 1 (from E) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   It separates constitutional isomers, diastereomers, **and** enantiomers.\n*   Essentially, every unique stereoisomer in the mixture will be separated from all the others, assuming the column has adequate resolving power.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture of 5 unique stereoisomers:\n*   Product A will be separated.\n*   Product B will be separated.\n*   Product C will be separated.\n*   Product D will be separated (from its enantiomer, C).\n*   Product E will be separated.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
