    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the synthesis reaction to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction:** Nitration of Benzene.\n*   **Reagents:** A mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is known as \"mixed acid\". H2SO4 protonates HNO3 to generate the highly electrophilic nitronium ion (NO2+).\n*   **Mechanism:** Benzene undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution where a hydrogen atom on the ring is replaced by a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Product 1:** Nitrobenzene.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** Bromination of Nitrobenzene.\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2) and a Lewis acid catalyst, which is generated in situ from iron powder and bromine (Fe + Br2 → FeBr3).\n*   **Mechanism:** This is another electrophilic aromatic substitution. The nitro group (-NO2) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the benzene ring towards electrophilic attack. It is also a **meta-director**. Therefore, the incoming bromine atom will be directed to the position meta (position 3) to the nitro group.\n*   **Product 2:** m-Bromonitrobenzene (or 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the nitro group.\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H2) and palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The nitro group (-NO2) is reduced to a primary amino group (-NH2). The carbon-bromine bond is typically unaffected under these conditions.\n*   **Product 3:** m-Bromoaniline (or 3-bromoaniline).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reaction:** Diazotization of an aromatic amine.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF4).\n*   **Mechanism:** The primary amino group of 3-bromoaniline reacts with nitrous acid (formed from NaNO2 and H+) at low temperatures (0-5 °C) to form a diazonium salt. The tetrafluoroborate anion (BF4-) from HBF4 acts as the counter-ion, forming a relatively stable diazonium salt.\n*   **Product 4:** 3-Bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate.\n\n**Step 5: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole, forming final product 5.**\n*   **Reaction:** Gomberg-Bachmann reaction.\n*   **Reagents:** The diazonium salt (Product 4) is decomposed in the presence of another aromatic compound, anisole (methoxybenzene). Heating facilitates the decomposition.\n*   **Mechanism:** The 3-bromobenzenediazonium salt decomposes upon heating to lose nitrogen gas (N2) and form a highly reactive **3-bromophenyl radical**. This radical then attacks the anisole molecule. Anisole has a methoxy group (-OCH3), which is a strongly activating and **ortho, para-directing** group. Due to steric hindrance, the attack by the bulky 3-bromophenyl radical will occur predominantly at the **para position** (position 4) of the anisole ring. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond, linking the two aromatic rings.\n*   **Structure of Product 5:** The final product is a biphenyl derivative. One ring has a bromine atom at position 3 (meta to the biphenyl linkage). The other ring has a methoxy group at position 4 (para to the biphenyl linkage).\n*   **Name of Product 5:** 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect. The product contains a methoxy group, not a fluorine atom.\nB) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect. The bromine atom is at the 3-position, not the 4-position.\nC) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Correct. This name perfectly describes the structure of the product formed.\nD) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect. The methoxy group adds to the para (4') position, not the ortho (2') position, due to sterics.\n\n<<<C>>>"
