    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Modeling the Radiating System:** The problem describes an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. In the far-field (radiation zone), any oscillating charge distribution with a net oscillating dipole moment can be approximated as an oscillating electric dipole. The oscillation of this dipole is what causes the electromagnetic radiation.\n\n2.  **Electric Dipole Radiation Formula:** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where:\n    *   `θ` is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis in this case).\n    *   `C` is a factor that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment, the frequency of oscillation, and fundamental constants, but it does *not* depend on the angle `θ`.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Angular Dependence:**\n    *   The radiated power per unit solid angle, which the problem calls `f(λ, θ)`, is directly proportional to `sin²(θ)`.\n    *   `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\n4.  **Finding the Maximum Radiated Power (A):**\n    *   The maximum power `A` is radiated in the direction where `sin²(θ)` is maximum.\n    *   The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs when `θ = 90°` (or π/2 radians). This is the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis.\n    *   So, `A = f_max ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Power at θ = 30°:**\n    *   We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n    *   The power at this angle is `f(λ, 30°) ∝ sin²(30°)`.\n    *   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    *   Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n6.  **Determining the Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power.\n    *   Fraction = `f(λ, 30°) / A = (proportionality constant * sin²(30°)) / (proportionality constant * sin²(90°))`\n    *   Fraction = `(1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n    *   This result eliminates options C and D.\n\n7.  **Analyzing the Wavelength (λ) Dependence:**\n    *   Now, let's look at the full formula for the radiated power per unit solid angle:\n        `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π²ε₀c³) * sin²(θ)`\n        where `p₀` is the dipole moment amplitude, `ω` is the angular frequency, `c` is the speed of light, and `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n    *   The key dependence we are interested in is on the wavelength `λ`.\n    *   The angular frequency `ω` is related to the frequency `ν` and wavelength `λ` by:\n        `ω = 2πν` and `c = νλ`, which implies `ν = c/λ`.\n    *   Substituting `ν` into the equation for `ω`, we get:\n        `ω = 2π(c/λ)`\n    *   The radiated power `f` is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n        `f ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n    *   This inverse fourth power dependence on wavelength is characteristic of dipole radiation and is also famously known as the principle behind Rayleigh scattering (which is why the sky is blue).\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The fraction of maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n    *   The radiated power per unit solid angle `f` is proportional to **λ⁻⁴**.\n    *   Combining these two findings, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
