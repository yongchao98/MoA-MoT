    "Here is a breakdown of the step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Abundance Notation**\n\nThe notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of two elements, X and Y, in a star relative to the Sun. It is defined as:\n`[X/Y] = log10(nX / nY)_star - log10(nX / nY)_sun`\n\nWhere `nX` and `nY` are the number densities of elements X and Y, respectively.\n\nWe are given the following solar abundances:\n*   `12 + log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5`  => `log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5`\n*   `12 + log10(nMg/nH)_sun = 7.0`  => `log10(nMg/nH)_sun = 7.0 - 12 = -5.0`\n\nFrom standard solar abundance tables (like Asplund et al., 2009), the solar abundance of Silicon is:\n*   `12 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun = 7.51` => `log10(nSi/nH)_sun = 7.51 - 12 = -4.49`\n\n**2. Calculate the Silicon Abundance in Star_1**\n\nWe need to find `log10(nSi/nH)_1`. We can express this as:\n`log10(nSi/nH)_1 = log10((nSi/nFe)_1 * (nFe/nH)_1)`\n`log10(nSi/nH)_1 = log10(nSi/nFe)_1 + log10(nFe/nH)_1`\n\nLet's find the two terms on the right side:\n*   **Term 1: `log10(nFe/nH)_1`**\n    We are given `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`.\n    `[Fe/H]_1 = log10(nFe/nH)_1 - log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 0`\n    `log10(nFe/nH)_1 = log10(nFe/nH)_sun = -4.5`\n\n*   **Term 2: `log10(nSi/nFe)_1`**\n    We are given `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`.\n    `[Si/Fe]_1 = log10(nSi/nFe)_1 - log10(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3`\n    `log10(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 + log10(nSi/nFe)_sun`\n    `log10(nSi/nFe)_sun = log10(nSi/nH)_sun - log10(nFe/nH)_sun = -4.49 - (-4.5) = 0.01`\n    `log10(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 + 0.01 = 0.31`\n\nNow, combine the terms to find the silicon abundance in Star_1:\n`log10(nSi/nH)_1 = 0.31 + (-4.5) = -4.19`\n\n**3. Calculate the Silicon Abundance in Star_2**\n\nWe need to find `log10(nSi/nH)_2`. We are given information involving Mg, so let's use that.\n`log10(nSi/nH)_2 = log10((nSi/nMg)_2 * (nMg/nH)_2)`\n`log10(nSi/nH)_2 = log10(nSi/nMg)_2 + log10(nMg/nH)_2`\n\nLet's find the two terms on the right side:\n*   **Term 1: `log10(nMg/nH)_2`**\n    We are given `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`.\n    `[Mg/H]_2 = log10(nMg/nH)_2 - log10(nMg/nH)_sun = 0`\n    `log10(nMg/nH)_2 = log10(nMg/nH)_sun = -5.0`\n\n*   **Term 2: `log10(nSi/nMg)_2`**\n    We are given `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`.\n    `[Mg/Si]_2 = log10(nMg/nSi)_2 - log10(nMg/nSi)_sun = 0.3`\n    We need `log10(nSi/nMg)_2`, which is `-log10(nMg/nSi)_2`.\n    `log10(nMg/nSi)_2 = 0.3 + log10(nMg/nSi)_sun`\n    `log10(nMg/nSi)_sun = log10(nMg/nH)_sun - log10(nSi/nH)_sun = -5.0 - (-4.49) = -0.51`\n    `log10(nMg/nSi)_2 = 0.3 + (-0.51) = -0.21`\n    Therefore, `log10(nSi/nMg)_2 = -(-0.21) = 0.21`\n\nNow, combine the terms to find the silicon abundance in Star_2:\n`log10(nSi/nH)_2 = 0.21 + (-5.0) = -4.79`\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Atoms**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the number densities of silicon atoms in the two stars, `nSi_1 / nSi_2`.\nSince the abundances are given relative to hydrogen (`nSi/nH`), the ratio is:\n`Ratio = (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`\n\nWe can find this by using the logarithmic values we calculated:\n`log10(Ratio) = log10((nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2)`\n`log10(Ratio) = log10(nSi/nH)_1 - log10(nSi/nH)_2`\n`log10(Ratio) = -4.19 - (-4.79) = 0.6`\n\nNow, solve for the ratio:\n`Ratio = 10^0.6`\n`Ratio â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\nThe ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately 3.98. The other given information (stellar masses, LTE, EW method) is context for how the abundances were derived but is not needed for the calculation itself.\n\n<<<A>>>"
