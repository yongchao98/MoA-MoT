    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nwhere:\n- T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n- R_star is the star's radius.\n- 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- 'A' is the planet's albedo.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures:**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)\nT_eq2 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms will cancel out in the ratio:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2)] / [(R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2)]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data:**\nThe problem provides information about the Doppler shift (Δλ) caused by each planet, which is a result of the radial velocity (RV) method. The maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n\nThe relationship between the Doppler shift and the radial velocity is:\nΔλ / λ_0 = v_r / c  =>  v_r = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\nThe RV amplitude (K) is therefore directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ):\nK ∝ Δλ\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit detected via the transit method (implying an edge-on orbit, sin(i) ≈ 1), the star's RV amplitude (K) is given by:\nK = (M_p / M_star) * v_p\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and v_p is the planet's orbital velocity.\n\nThe planet's orbital velocity is v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a). Substituting this into the equation for K:\nK = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nK = (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\n**5. Solve for the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\nFrom the formula above, we can see how 'a' relates to K and M_p. Let's rearrange the formula to solve for 'a':\nsqrt(a) = (M_p * sqrt(G)) / (K * sqrt(M_star))\na = (M_p² * G) / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, let's form the ratio a2 / a1. The terms G and M_star are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\na2 / a1 = [(M_p2² * G) / (K2² * M_star)] / [(M_p1² * G) / (K1² * M_star)]\na2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) * (K1² / M_p1²)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n**6. Substitute Known Values:**\nWe are given:\n- Mass ratio: M_p1 = 7 M_earth, M_p2 = 5 M_earth  =>  M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n- Doppler shifts: Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, Δλ2 = 0.04 Å. Since K ∝ Δλ, the ratio of RV amplitudes is:\nK1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow substitute these ratios into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\nNow we use the relationship from Step 3:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nTo get the decimal value, we can perform the division.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Ratio of planet masses (Mp2 / Mp1)\nmp_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# Ratio of radial velocity amplitudes (K1 / K2), which is the same as the ratio of Doppler shifts\nk_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\n# And sqrt(a2/a1) = (Mp2/Mp1) * (K1/K2)\ntemp_ratio = mp_ratio * k_ratio\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\n15/28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet (T_eq) is determined by the energy balance between the stellar radiation it absorbs and the thermal radiation it emits. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   'A' is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2), most terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1/a1)^(1/2)] / [(1/a2)^(1/2)] = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1) using the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * v_orbital = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nK = (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\nRearranging for 'a':\nsqrt(a) = (M_p * sqrt(G)) / (K * sqrt(M_star))\na = (M_p^2 * G) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\nNow, let's find the ratio a2 / a1. The constants G and M_star will cancel out:\na2 / a1 = [M_p2^2 / K2^2] / [M_p1^2 / K1^2]\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\nThe ratio of RV amplitudes (K1 / K2) is directly proportional to the ratio of their observed Doppler shifts (Δλ1 / Δλ2).\n\nGiven:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth, M_p2 = 5 M_earth  =>  M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, Δλ2 = 0.04 Å  =>  K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow substitute these into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2\n\nFinally, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt( (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5/7) * (3/4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
