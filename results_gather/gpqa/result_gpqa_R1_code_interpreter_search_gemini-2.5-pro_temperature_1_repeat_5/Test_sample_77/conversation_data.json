    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that the electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potential at an observation point `\\vec{r}` at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`.\n\n**1. Definitions and Setup**\n\n*   `q`: Charge of the point particle.\n*   `\\vec{s}(t)`: Position vector of the charge as a function of time (its trajectory).\n*   `\\vec{r}`: Position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   `t`: Time of observation.\n*   `tr`: Retarded time, the time at which the charge emitted the field that reaches `\\vec{r}` at time `t`.\n*   `\\vec{s}(tr)`: Position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `\\vec{d}`: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$. Its magnitude is `d = |\\vec{d}|`.\n*   `\\vec{v}`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=tr}$.\n\n**2. The Retardation Condition**\n\nThe time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `\\vec{r}` is `d/c`. This gives the fundamental relationship between `t` and `tr`:\n$t = tr + \\frac{d}{c} \\implies t - tr = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|}{c}$\n\n**3. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials**\n\nFor a general time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$, the retarded potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere `tr` in the integrand is the retarded time, `tr = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`.\n\n**4. Application to a Point Charge**\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along trajectory `\\vec{s}(t)`, the charge and current densities are expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe integral is not straightforward because the retarded time `tr` inside the delta function depends on the integration variable `\\vec{r}'`. The evaluation of this integral (a standard result in electrodynamics) yields a correction factor related to the motion of the source. The result of the integration is:\n$\\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|})} \\right]_{tr}$\n\nHere, the expression in the brackets is evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. Using our notation (`\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)` and `\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(tr)`):\nThe term becomes: $\\frac{1}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d})} = \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n**5. Deriving the Scalar Potential (V)**\n\nSubstituting this result back into the formula for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**6. Deriving the Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$)**\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(tr) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nThe velocity `\\vec{v}(tr)` can be taken out of the integral as it is evaluated at the specific retarded time `tr`.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nThe integral is the same as before.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nThe derived expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option C. We can also note the relationship $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$, since $\\mu_o\\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\n$\\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\nAnd our expression for $\\vec{A}$ is:\n$\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{(1/\\epsilon_o c^2) qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\nThe relationship holds.\n\nComparing our final result with the given options:\n*   A) Incorrect form, doesn't account for retardation properly.\n*   B) Incorrect sign in the denominator and uses $\\mu$ instead of $\\mu_o$.\n*   C) Matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials exactly.\n*   D) Incorrect form for both V and A.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
