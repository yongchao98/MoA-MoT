    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Dilution**\n\n*   We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   This solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   First, we need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution, as this is the solution we will be titrating.\n*   We can use the dilution formula: M₁V₁ = M₂V₂\n    *   M₁ = 0.05 M (initial concentration)\n    *   V₁ = 20.00 cm³ (initial volume)\n    *   V₂ = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ (final volume)\n    *   M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n*   So, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH.\n\n**2. Titration Reaction**\n\nThe reaction between the weak acid (acetic acid) and the strong base (NaOH) is:\nCH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n\n**3. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻Na⁺). This means the solution contains a mixture of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), which forms a buffer.\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to calculate the pH of a buffer solution:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Determine the ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid is converted to base, and 75% of the acid remains.\n    *   Ratio = [A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.253\n\n**4. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate. The solution now contains only sodium acetate and water.\n*   Acetate (CH₃COO⁻) is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will react with water (hydrolyze) to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic.\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Step 4a: Find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\n    *   Moles of acid = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.0400 L = 0.001 moles\n    *   At equivalence, moles of base = moles of acid.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Step 4b: Find the concentration of acetate at the equivalence point.**\n    *   Total volume = Volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   Moles of acetate formed = initial moles of acid = 0.001 moles\n    *   Concentration of acetate = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Step 4c: Calculate the [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis of acetate.**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we can simplify: x² ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ * 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Step 4d: Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\n**5.

    "**Detailed Step-by-Step Derivation:**\n\n**1. Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\n\n*   **Initial state:** We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Dilution:** We add 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   **Final volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Use the dilution formula (M₁V₁ = M₂V₂):**\n    *   M₁ = 0.05 M\n    *   V₁ = 20.00 cm³\n    *   V₂ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n*   So, the solution being titrated is 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At any point during the titration before the equivalence point, we have a buffer solution containing both acetic acid (HA) and its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻).\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used for buffer pH calculations:\n    **pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])**\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Determine the ratio of [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the original acid (HA) has been converted into its conjugate base (A⁻), and 75% of the acid remains.\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log₁₀(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log₁₀(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which hydrolyzes water.\n    **CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻**\n*   **Step 3.1: Find the moles of acid and the volume of NaOH needed.**\n    *   Moles of acid = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n    *   At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH added = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Step 3.2: Find the concentration of acetate ([A⁻]) at the equivalence point.**\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   Concentration of acetate = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n*   **Step 3.3: Calculate the [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis reaction.**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka\n    *   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   For the hydrolysis equilibrium, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]. Let x = [OH⁻].\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02)\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Step 3.4: Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
