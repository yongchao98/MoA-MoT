    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning and calculation process to determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Concepts**\n\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (d):** This is the average distance a particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays. It depends on the particle's speed (v) and its lifetime in the lab frame (τ). The formula is `d = v * τ`.\n*   **Decay Width (Γ):** In quantum mechanics, the decay width of an unstable particle is related to its lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. A larger width implies a shorter lifetime.\n*   **Proper Lifetime (τ₀):** This is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. It is related to the decay width by the formula: `τ₀ = ħ / Γ`, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** Since the particle is produced with high energy (8 GeV) compared to its mass (1.2 GeV), it travels at a speed very close to the speed of light (c). We must account for relativistic effects:\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime observed in the lab frame (τ) is longer than the proper lifetime (τ₀) by a factor of γ (the Lorentz factor): `τ = γ * τ₀`.\n    *   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** This is calculated from the particle's total energy (E) and rest mass (m): `γ = E / m`. (Using units where c=1).\n*   **Combined Formula:** Putting these concepts together, the mean decay distance is:\n    d = v * τ = v * γ * τ₀\n    Since v = βc (where β is the speed as a fraction of c), we can write:\n    d = (βc) * γ * (ħ / Γ)\n    d = (βγ) * (ħc / Γ)\n\nThe term `βγ` can be calculated directly from energy and mass:\n`γ = E / m`\n`β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²)`\n`βγ = γ * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = sqrt(γ² - 1) = sqrt((E/m)² - 1)`\n\nAn alternative way to express `βγ` is using momentum (p):\n`E² = p² + m²` (in units where c=1)\n`p = sqrt(E² - m²)`\nThe relativistic momentum is also `p = γβm`. Therefore, `βγ = p/m`.\n\nSo the final formula for the mean decay distance is:\n`d = (p / m) * (ħc / Γ)`  or `d = sqrt((E/m)² - 1) * (ħc / Γ)`\n\n### **2. Listing the Given Values and Constants**\n\n*   Production Energy (E_X): 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Mass (m_X): 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n*   Decay Width (Γ_X): 320 MeV\n*   Reduced Planck constant times speed of light (ħc): A crucial constant in particle physics, `ħc ≈ 197.327 MeV fm` or `1.97327 × 10⁻¹³ MeV m`.\n\n### **3. Calculation**\n\nWe will now perform the calculation using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Given Values ---\nE_X = 8000  # Total energy in MeV\nm_X = 1200  # Rest mass in MeV\nGamma_X = 320  # Decay width in MeV\n\n# --- Constants ---\n# hbar*c in MeV*m\nhbar_c_m = 1.97327e-13\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) ---\ngamma = E_X / m_X\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the relativistic factor beta*gamma ---\n# beta*gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nbeta_gamma = np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the mean proper lifetime (tau_0) multiplied by c ---\n# c * tau_0 = c * (hbar / Gamma_X) = hbar_c / Gamma_X\nc_tau0 = hbar_c_m / Gamma_X\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance (d) ---\n# d = v * tau = (beta*c) * (gamma*tau_0) = beta*gamma * c*tau_0\nmean_decay_distance = beta_gamma * c_tau0\n\nprint(f\"The calculated mean decay distance is: {mean_decay_distance:.4e} m\")\n\n# --- Let's check the options ---\n# Option D is 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\noption_D = 4.0655e-15\ndifference = abs(mean_decay_distance - option_D)\npercentage_difference = (difference / mean_decay_distance) * 100\nprint(f\"The difference between the calculation and option D is {percentage_difference:.3f}%.\")\n```\nExecution of the code gives the following output:\n```\nThe calculated mean decay distance is: 4.0645e-15 m\nThe difference between the calculation and option D is 0.024%.\n```\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated mean decay distance is `4.0645 × 10⁻¹⁵ m`. This value is extremely close to option D. The minor difference of about 0.024% is likely due to a slight variation in the value of the constant `ħc` used to create the problem's options. Based on the calculation, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
