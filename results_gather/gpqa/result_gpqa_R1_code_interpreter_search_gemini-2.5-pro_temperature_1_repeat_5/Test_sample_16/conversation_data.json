    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry:** The problem involves a solution of a metal-ligand complex, Calcium-EDTA ($[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$). This complex exists in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and the EDTA ligand ($EDTA^{4-}$). We are asked to find the concentration of the free calcium ions at equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Equilibrium:** The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by the reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the formation constant, $K_f$ (given as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which has a value of $5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\n    To find the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ starting from the complex, it is more convenient to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Determine the Dissociation Constant ($K_d$):** The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant ($K_f$):\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex, and initially, there are no free calcium or EDTA ions. Let 'x' be the change in concentration due to dissociation.\n\n| Species             | $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ | $Ca^{2+}$ | $EDTA^{4-}$ |\n| ------------------- | ----------------- | --------- | ----------- |\n| **I**nitial (M)     | 0.02              | 0         | 0           |\n| **C**hange (M)      | -x                | +x        | +x          |\n| **E**quilibrium (M) | 0.02 - x          | x         | x           |\n\n    Note: The problem states \"ideal pH\". This implies the pH is high enough (typically >10) that virtually all uncomplexed EDTA is in the $EDTA^{4-}$ form. This allows us to use the given $K_f$ value directly without needing a pH-dependent conditional formation constant.\n\n5.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression:** Now, we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for the dissociation constant, $K_d$:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\n6.  **Simplify and Solve for x:** The formation constant $K_f$ is very large, which means the dissociation constant $K_d$ is very small. This indicates that the dissociation is minimal, and therefore 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying approximation that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n    Now, solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Finally, solve for x by taking the square root:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n    This calculated value matches option B. I will use a python script to perform the calculation precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The dissociation constant Kd is the inverse of the formation constant Kf.\n# Kd = 1 / (5 * 10^10) = 2 * 10^-11\n# The equilibrium is [Ca(EDTA)]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n# The equilibrium expression is Kd = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [[Ca(EDTA)]^2-]\n# Let x = [Ca^2+] = [EDTA^4-] at equilibrium.\n# Then [[Ca(EDTA)]^2-] = 0.02 - x.\n# Kd = x^2 / (0.02 - x)\n# Since Kd is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n# So, Kd ≈ x^2 / 0.02\n# x^2 ≈ Kd * 0.02\n# x = sqrt(Kd * 0.02)\n\nk_f = 5e10\ninitial_conc = 0.02\nk_d = 1 / k_f\n\nx_squared = k_d * initial_conc\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of calcium ions is approximately {x:.1e} M.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium in question is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\nThe formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for the forward reaction ($Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$) is given as $5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of the dissociated ions.

Therefore, we can assume that x is much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (x << 0.02). This allows us to simplify the denominator:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nNow, the equation simplifies to:\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\nSolve for $x^2$:\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nSolve for x by taking the square root:\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is x, which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches the result from the code execution.\n\n<<<B>>>"
