    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle as the number of sides N approaches infinity. The radius of this circle is equal to the apothem 'a'.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius 'a'. The diameter of this circular aperture is D = 2a.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The angular positions of the minima in this pattern are given by the formula:\nsin(θ) = m * λ / D\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the aperture.\n*   m is a coefficient determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J1(x).\n\nFor small angles, we can use the approximation sin(θ) ≈ θ. So, the formula becomes:\nθ ≈ m * λ / D\n\nThe values of 'm' for the first few minima are approximately:\n*   For the first minimum (n=1): m1 ≈ 1.220\n*   For the second minimum (n=2): m2 ≈ 2.233\n*   For the third minimum (n=3): m3 ≈ 3.238\n\nWe need to find the angular positions of the first two minima.\n\n**First Minimum (θ1):**\nUsing m1 = 1.220 and D = 2a:\nθ1 ≈ 1.220 * λ / (2a)\nθ1 ≈ 0.610 * λ / a\n\n**Second Minimum (θ2):**\nUsing m2 = 2.233 and D = 2a:\nθ2 ≈ 2.233 * λ / (2a)\nθ2 ≈ 1.1165 * λ / a\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ2 - θ1.\n\nΔθ = (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.1165 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ = 0.5065 * λ / a\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1.220 λ /a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value 0.5065 λ / a is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
