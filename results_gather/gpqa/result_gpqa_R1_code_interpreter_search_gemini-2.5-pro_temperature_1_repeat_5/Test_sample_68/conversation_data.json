    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum track length that needs to be resolved by the CERN Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle. This involves several steps based on the principles of special relativity and particle decay.\n\n### 1. Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physics**\nThe problem involves a relativistic particle ($X^0$) that decays. We are given its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), its rest mass ($m_0$), and its total energy ($E$) in the lab frame (the bubble chamber).\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** Because the particle is moving at a relativistic speed, its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This is described by the time dilation formula: $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor can be calculated from the particle's total energy ($E$) and its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$). The relation is $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$. In particle physics, we often use units where $c=1$, so $\\gamma = E/m_0$.\n*   **Decay Length:** In the lab frame, the particle travels a certain distance before decaying. The average distance is called the mean decay length ($\\lambda$), given by $\\lambda = v \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity. For highly relativistic particles, the velocity $v$ is very close to the speed of light, $c$.\n*   **Decay Probability:** The decay of particles follows an exponential probability law. The probability that a particle travels a distance $L$ before decaying is given by a distribution. The fraction of particles that decay within a distance $L$ from their creation point is $P(\\text{decay within } L) = 1 - e^{-L/\\lambda}$.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Question**\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\".\n\"Observing a decay\" means being able to distinguish the decay event (the appearance of daughter tracks $Y^+$ and $Z^-$) from the particle's creation point. This implies the particle must travel a certain distance, $L$, before decaying.\nIf the detector's resolution is $L_{res}$, it can only observe decays that happen at a distance $L > L_{res}$. The fraction of decays observed would be $P(L > L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda}$.\nThe question asks for the *minimum* resolution needed to see *at least* 30% of decays. A \"minimum resolution\" means the smallest possible distance that can be resolved (i.e., the best possible resolution). If our resolution is $L_{res}$, we see all decays happening at distances greater than $L_{res}$. To see *more* decays, we need a *better* (smaller) $L_{res}$.\nThis suggests that the question is asking for the value of the resolution $L_{res}$ such that the fraction of observed decays is exactly 30%.\nFraction observed = $P(L > L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$.\n\nSo, we need to find the value of $L_{res}$ that satisfies this equation.\n\n**Step 3: Calculation Plan**\n1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = E/m_0$.\n2.  Calculate the mean lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n3.  Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame, $\\lambda = v \\tau$. We can approximate the particle's velocity $v$ as the speed of light $c$, since it is highly relativistic ($\\gamma \\gg 1$).\n4.  Solve the equation $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$ for the required resolution $L_{res}$. This gives $L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$.\n\n### 2. Computation\n\nI will now use a Python script to perform the calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given constants\nE = 27  # Total energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41 # Rest mass in GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16 # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458 # Speed of light in m/s\nfraction_to_observe = 0.30 # We need to observe at least 30% of the decays\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# E = gamma * m0 * c^2. In units of GeV, we can use E = gamma * m0.\ngamma = E / m0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean lifetime in the lab frame (tau)\ntau = gamma * tau0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the mean decay length (lambda)\n# For a highly relativistic particle (gamma >> 1), its speed v is very close to c.\n# We will use v = c for this calculation.\n# lambda = v * tau â‰ˆ c * tau\nlambda_decay = c * tau\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the required resolution (L_res)\n# The fraction of decays observed for a resolution L_res is P(L > L_res) = exp(-L_res / lambda).\n# We want this fraction to be 0.30.\n# exp(-L_res / lambda) = 0.30\n# Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n# -L_res / lambda = ln(0.30)\n# L_res = -lambda * ln(0.30)\nL_res = -lambda_decay * np.log(fraction_to_observe)\n\nprint(f\"{L_res:.3e}\")\n```\n\n### 3. Execution Output\n```\n2.285e-06\n```\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculation shows that the required resolution is $2.285 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters. This is the distance $L_{res}$ such that 30% of the particles will travel further than this distance before decaying. To be able to observe these 30% of decays, the bubble chamber's resolution must be at least this good (i.e., capable of resolving distances of this size or smaller).\n\nNow, let's compare this result with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nOur calculated value, $2.285 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is closest to option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small discrepancy might arise from using slightly different values for the speed of light or from a different interpretation of the question. However, the order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$ m) and the leading digit match reasonably well. Let's re-examine the calculation for option C. If the answer were $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, this would correspond to $\\ln(0.30)$ being approximately -1.09 instead of -1.204. No standard physics constant would account for this difference. The interpretation of the problem and the calculation method are standard. Therefore, $2.285 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is the correct calculation, and option C is the closest answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle. In a particle detector like a bubble chamber, a \"decay\" is observed by seeing the tracks of the daughter particles ($Y^+$ and $Z^-$) appear at a point different from where the parent particle ($X^0$) was created. This means the parent particle must travel a certain distance, $L$, before it decays.\n\nA detector's \"resolution\" can be thought of as the minimum track length, $L_{res}$, that it can reliably measure. Therefore, to observe a decay, the particle must travel a distance $L > L_{res}$.\n\nThe question states we need to observe *at least* 30% of the decays. The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential probability law. The fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than $L_{res}$ before decaying is given by $P(L > L_{res}) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\nSo, the condition we need to satisfy is:\n$e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary case:\n$e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-L_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$L_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe mean decay length ($\\lambda$) depends on the particle's speed ($v$) and its lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau_{lab}$).\n$\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to relativistic time dilation:\n$\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is determined by the particle's total energy ($E$) and its rest mass ($m_0$):\n$E = \\gamma \\cdot m_0 c^2$\nIn particle physics, it's common to use units where energy and mass are given in GeV (and GeV/$c^2$), so the formula simplifies to:\n$\\gamma = E / m_0$\n\nFor a highly relativistic particle ($\\gamma \\gg 1$), its speed $v$ is very close to the speed of light, $c$. We can approximate $v \\approx c$.\nSo, the mean decay length can be calculated as:\n$\\lambda \\approx c \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = c \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Calculations**\n\nFirst, let's gather the given values:\n*   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest Mass, $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/$c^2$\n*   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of Light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nNow, let's execute the calculation plan. I will use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41 # Rest mass in GeV/c^2\ntau0 = 8e-16 # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458 # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E / m0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean lifetime in the lab frame (tau_lab)\ntau_lab = gamma * tau0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the mean decay length (lambda)\n# Using the approximation v â‰ˆ c, which is very accurate for high gamma\nlambda_decay = c * tau_lab\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the required resolution L_res\n# The fraction of decays to observe is 0.30.\n# L_res = -lambda * ln(fraction_to_observe)\nfraction_to_observe = 0.30\nL_res = -lambda_decay * np.log(fraction_to_observe)\n\nprint(f\"{L_res:.4e}\")\n```\n\n### 2. Execution Output\n```\n2.2861e-06\n```\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe calculation gives a required resolution of $L_{res} = 2.2861 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters. This is the largest possible resolution length (i.e., the coarsest resolution) that will still allow for the observation of 30% of the decays. Any detector with a better resolution (a smaller resolution length) would observe more than 30%.\n\nNow we compare our calculated result with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nOur calculated value, $2.2861 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is very close to option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. They share the same order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) and the same leading digit. The minor difference (~10%) is likely due to slight variations in the constants used or rounding in the problem's design. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physics of Particle Decay**\n\nThe problem involves a relativistic particle ($X^0$) decaying in a bubble chamber. We need to connect the particle's properties (mass, energy, proper lifetime) to the observable decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** A particle's energy ($E$) is related to its rest mass ($m_0$) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$. The relationship is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$. In high-energy physics, we often use units where energy is in GeV and mass is in GeV/$c^2$, which simplifies the formula to $\\gamma = E / m_0$.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The particle has a proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$, which is its lifetime in its own rest frame. Due to time dilation, an observer in the laboratory frame will measure a longer lifetime, $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** In the lab frame, the particle travels, on average, a distance $\\lambda$ before decaying. This distance is the product of its velocity ($v$) and its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$). For highly relativistic particles (where $\\gamma \\gg 1$), the velocity $v$ is extremely close to the speed of light, $c$. Thus, we can approximate $\\lambda \\approx c \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$. Combining these, the mean decay length is $\\lambda \\approx c \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability that a particle will survive to travel a distance $L$ before decaying is given by an exponential distribution: $P(\\text{travels at least } L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\".\nTo \"observe\" a decay, the track of the parent particle must be long enough to be distinguished from the creation point. Let's call this minimum distinguishable length the resolution, $L_{res}$. This means we can only observe decays that happen at a distance $L > L_{res}$.\n\nThe fraction of decays that occur after a distance $L_{res}$ is $P(L > L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda}$.\nWe are asked to find the resolution needed to observe *at least* 30% of the decays. This translates to the condition:\n$P(L > L_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n$e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition, which represents the coarsest resolution that still meets the requirement:\n$e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nSolving for $L_{res}$:\n$-L_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$L_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**Step 3: Plan the Calculation**\n\n1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, using the given energy and mass.\n2.  Calculate the mean decay length, $\\lambda$, using $\\gamma$, the proper lifetime $\\tau_0$, and the speed of light $c$.\n3.
