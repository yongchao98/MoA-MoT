    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Name:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Base Structure:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The numbering convention for bicyclic systems places the bridgehead carbons at C1 and C6. The `7-oxa` indicates that the C7 atom of the parent bicycloalkane (which would form the three-membered ring with C1 and C6) is replaced by an oxygen atom. This is the standard IUPAC name for a cyclohexane epoxide.\n*   **Substituents:** `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups on carbons 1, 3, and 4 of the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` defines the absolute configuration at the four chiral centers.\n\nLet's determine the relative stereochemistry of the substituents by drawing a planar representation of the cyclohexane ring. We will assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing \"UP\" (on a wedged bond).\n\n*   **Center C6 (S configuration):** The bonds are to O(up), C1, C5, and H. The priority order is O > C1 > C5 > H. For the configuration to be (S), with the oxygen UP, the path O -> C1 -> C5 must be counter-clockwise if the H is also UP (lowest priority group pointing towards the viewer, so rule is reversed) or clockwise if the H is DOWN. Looking at a standard drawing, O->C1->C5 is clockwise. To get (S), the H at C6 must be **UP** (cis to the epoxide).\n*   **Center C1 (R configuration):** The bonds are to O(up), C6, C2, and a methyl group (Me). The priority is O > C6 > C2 > Me. The path O -> C6 -> C2 is clockwise. For the configuration to be (R), the lowest priority group (Me) must be pointing away from the viewer. Therefore, the methyl group at C1 is **DOWN** (trans to the epoxide).\n*   **Center C4 (R configuration):** The bonds are to C3, C5, Me, and H. The priority order is C3 > C5 > Me > H. Let's assume the H is DOWN. The path C3 -> C5 -> Me must be clockwise for (R). This occurs if the methyl group at C4 is **UP**.\n*   **Center C3 (R configuration):** The bonds are to C2, C4, Me, and H. The priority order is C2 > C4 > Me > H. To get an (R) configuration, if we place H UP, the path C2 -> C4 -> Me must be counter-clockwise. This occurs if the methyl group at C3 is **DOWN**.\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   A cyclohexane ring with an epoxide on the **UP** face.\n*   C1-Me is **DOWN**.\n*   C3-Me is **DOWN**.\n*   C4-Me is **UP**.\n*   The H on C6 is **UP**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). This provides a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity Rule (given):** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Furthermore, for the required backside attack (from the DOWN face, opposite the epoxide), the approach to C1 is sterically blocked by the C1-methyl group which is also on the DOWN face. The approach to C6 is much less hindered.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack occurs at **C6**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity Rule (given):** **Inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks.\n    *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6.\n    *   The initial configuration of C6 is (S).\n    *   After the reaction, the configuration at this carbon will be (R).\n    *   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, C4) are not affected by the reaction (retention of configuration).\n\n**3. Determine the Product Structure and Name**\n\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  A new methyl group is added to C6 from the DOWN face (backside attack).\n    2.  The C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks.\n    3.  After workup (e.g., with water or mild acid), the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group, pointing UP.\n*   **Product Skeleton:** The reaction opens the bicyclic epoxide to form a substituted cyclohexanol. The substituents are four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group. The base name will be **tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Product IUPAC Numbering:**\n    *   The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. This is the original C1 of the starting material.\n    *   The ring is numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Methyl groups are located at: original C1, original C6, original C3, and original C4.\n    *   Let's set `new C1 = original C1`. Numbering counter-clockwise, `new C2 = original C6`. Then the other methyl groups fall at `new C4 = original C4` and `new C5 = original C3`. The substituent locants are 1, 2, 4, 5.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The configurations of the chiral centers that did not react are retained.\n    *   The configuration of the center that was attacked is inverted.\n    *   Configuration of `new C1` (from original C1): Retained as **(R)**.\n    *   Configuration of `new C2` (from original C6): Inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n    *   Configuration of `new C4` (from original C4): Retained as **(R)**.\n    *   Configuration of `new C5` (from original C3): Retained as **(R)**.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nCombining the name and stereochemistry, the final product is:\n**(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
