    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `%H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`.\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12): `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Rearranging the equation: `0.1428 * (12x + y) = y` -> `1.7136x + 0.1428y = y` -> `1.7136x = 0.8572y`.\n    *   The ratio `y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and the general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   Hydrocarbons with the formula CnH2n are either alkenes or cycloalkanes.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen\". This means Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's check its formula and H percentage:\n        *   Formula: C6H12. This fits CnH2n with n=6.\n        *   %H = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This matches perfectly.\n    *   So, we can confidently identify **Z as Cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions.**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X (components A and B) and mixture Y (components C and D) under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This means that hydrogenation of each of the four substances (A, B, C, D) must yield cyclohexane.\n    *   `Hydrogenation(A) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   `Hydrogenation(B) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   `Hydrogenation(C) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   `Hydrogenation(D) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   This implies that all four substances A, B, C, and D must have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered ring. Any side chains or different ring structures would yield different products upon hydrogenation. For example, hydrogenation of methylcyclopentane yields methylcyclopentane, not cyclohexane (though isomerization can occur under specific reforming conditions, the problem implies a common skeleton for all precursors).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. Let's say **C = Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Cyclohexane is saturated and fits this description.\n    *   What is D? D must also have a C6 ring skeleton, and its hydrogenation must yield cyclohexane. It also must not decolorize bromine water. The most common chemical species that fits this description is **Benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not react with bromine water. Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature) yields cyclohexane.\n    *   So, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   This mixture Y is formed by a \"disproportionation\" reaction when mixture X is heated with platinum. Disproportionation in this context refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   The reaction is: `Mixture X (A+B) -> Mixture Y (C+D)`\n    *   Substituting the identified compounds: `A + B -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n    *   Since Y is an equimolar mixture, the stoichiometry is 1:1.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X.**\n    *   The reaction is `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6`. By conservation of atoms, the total composition of A+B must be C12H18.\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. Both must have a C6-ring skeleton. So, A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy.\n    *   From `A+B = C12H18`, we have `x + y = 18`.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The problem states there are \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" in the molecules of X.\n    *   Let's consider possible unsaturated C6-ring molecules:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). It has one double bond, so no conjugation issue.\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). It has two non-conjugated double bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,3-diene (C6H8). It has conjugated double bonds, so it is ruled out.\n    *   Let's test the combination of A = Cyclohexene and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n    *   The sum of hydrogen atoms is `10 + 8 = 18`. This matches our requirement `x+y=18`.\n    *   The proposed disproportionation reaction is:\n        `C6H10 (Cyclohexene) + C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --Pt, heat--> C6H12 (Cyclohexane) + C6H6 (Benzene)`\n    *   In this reaction, cyclohexene (C6H10) is reduced by gaining 2H to become cyclohexane (C6H12). Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) is oxidized by losing 2H to become benzene (C6H6). This is a valid hydrogen transfer disproportionation.\n    *   Thus, **Mixture X consists of Cyclohexene (C6H10) and Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\".\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid (Cyclohexene) and one molecule of the second liquid (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene).\n    *   Number of H atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
