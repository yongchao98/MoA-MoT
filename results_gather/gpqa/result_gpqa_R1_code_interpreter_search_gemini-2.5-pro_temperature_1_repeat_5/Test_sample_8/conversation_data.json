    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. The C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a principal C3 axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to it. It does not contain any vertical mirror planes (σv) or C2 axes perpendicular to the principal axis.\n\n1.  **Analyze Quinuclidine (A)**\n    *   **Structure**: Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine with the formula C7H13N. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other. The two bridgeheads are connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv), each passing through the C3 axis and bisecting one of the ethylene bridges.\n    *   **Point Group**: The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n2.  **Analyze Triisopropyl borate (B)**\n    *   **Structure**: The formula is B(O-i-Pr)3, which is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, and each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group. The B-O3 core is trigonal planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane formed by the three oxygen atoms.\n        *   To minimize steric hindrance, the molecule can adopt a specific conformation. In this conformation, the plane containing the boron and the three oxygen atoms acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   For this to be a σh plane, each isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2] must be oriented symmetrically with respect to this plane. This is achieved if the C-H bond of the isopropyl group lies within the plane, with one methyl group positioned above the plane and the other below it.\n        *   The C3 rotation maps each of the three identical isopropyl groups onto the next.\n        *   The σh reflection swaps the \"up\" and \"down\" methyl groups on each isopropyl group, leaving the molecule unchanged.\n    *   **Point Group**: The molecule possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane, but it lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to C3 or any σv planes. This corresponds exactly to the **C3h** point group.\n\n3.  **Analyze Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (C)**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a large, complex molecule with a triphenylene core fused to three anhydride rings.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**: Due to severe steric hindrance between the adjacent anhydride groups, the molecule is not planar. It twists into a propeller-like shape.\n        *   This propeller shape has a C3 axis of rotation passing through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to the general plane.\n        *   However, because of the twisting, it loses all mirror planes (both σh and σv) and any C2 axes.\n    *   **Point Group**: With only a C3 axis, the point group is **C3**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (D)**\n    *   **Structure**: This compound is more commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused to three dicarboxylic anhydride rings.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   The molecule is completely planar.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   The molecular plane itself is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   There are three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the center and bisecting opposite bonds of the central benzene ring.\n        *   There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   **Point Group**: The combination of C3, 3 C2, σh, and 3 σv defines the **D3h** point group. While a D3h molecule contains all the symmetry elements of the C3h group (C3 and σh), its full symmetry is higher. In point group classification, the highest possible symmetry group is used.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Quinuclidine is C3v.\n*   Triisopropyl borate is C3h.\n*   The triphenylene derivative is C3.\n*   The benzo derivative (mellitic trianhydride) is D3h.\n\nThe question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. Triisopropyl borate is the only molecule whose point group is precisely C3h.\n\n<<<B>>>"
