    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This is a classic chemical equilibrium problem involving complex formation.\n\n**1. Identify the species in solution:**\nThe species present are the free cobalt(II) ion and the various thiocyanato complexes:\n*   `Co²⁺` (free ion)\n*   `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**2. Define the total cobalt concentration:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**3. Use the overall stability constants (β) to relate the concentrations:**\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the corresponding stability constant `βn`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**4. Substitute these expressions into the total concentration equation:**\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5. Determine the fraction (α₂) of the desired complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`:**\nThe fraction `α₂` is the concentration of `[Co(SCN)₂]` divided by the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions from steps 3 and 4:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**6. Plug in the given values and calculate:**\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M (Since the ligand concentration is in large excess compared to the metal ion concentration, 0.1 M >> 10⁻² M, we can assume the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to its initial concentration).\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40`\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n\nWe will now perform the calculation using a Python script for precision.\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator\nterm1 = beta1 * scn_conc\nterm2 = beta2 * (scn_conc ** 2)\nterm3 = beta3 * (scn_conc ** 3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (scn_conc ** 4)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of the relative concentrations of all species (where the free ion is 1)\ndenominator = 1 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator = term2\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage:.1f}%\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, among all cobalt-containing species in a solution.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\nWe have a solution containing `Co²⁺` ions and `SCN⁻` ligands. They react to form a series of complexes:\n*   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β).\n\n**2. Define the Distribution Coefficient (α)**\nThe fraction (or percentage) of any single species is given by its distribution coefficient, α. We are interested in `α₂`, the fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n\n`α₂ = [Concentration of the species of interest] / [Total concentration of all species]`\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nwhere `c(Co)` is the total concentration of cobalt, which is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**3. Use Stability Constants to Express Concentrations**\nThe concentration of each complex can be related to the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` using the overall stability constants `β_n`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**4. Derive the Formula for α₂**\nSubstitute these expressions into the equation for total cobalt concentration:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow substitute this and the expression for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` into the formula for `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, giving us the final formula for the fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex. This formula depends only on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\nWe are given the following values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M (We can assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the initial concentration because it is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration, 0.1 M >> 10⁻² M).\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40`\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n\nNow, let's calculate the terms in the formula:\n*   Numerator: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   Denominator:\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9`\n    *   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n    *   Sum of denominator terms = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate `α₂`:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution.\n\n<<<D>>>"
