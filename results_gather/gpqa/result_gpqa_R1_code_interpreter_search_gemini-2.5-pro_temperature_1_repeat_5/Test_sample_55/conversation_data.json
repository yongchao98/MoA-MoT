    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process:** The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom's |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state. This decay occurs via two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state. The process is a cascade decay:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply Dipole Selection Rules for the First Transition:**\n    The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer (for decay, $n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n    For the first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$:\n    *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   From the options, the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is a valid decay.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow l' = 1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply Dipole Selection Rules for the Second Transition:**\n    For the second transition, $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   Initial state: $n'=2, l'=1, m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the rule.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   This confirms that all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. All routes shown in the options are physically allowed.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of the Cascade:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    $P(\\text{path}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n    $P(\\text{path via } m') = \\text{BR}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\times \\text{BR}(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Branching Ratio for Step 1:**\n    *   The branching ratio for the transition to a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is the rate of that transition divided by the total decay rate from the initial state.\n    *   The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$. This state has $l=0$ and is therefore spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the decay must proceed to each of the three magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state with equal probability.\n    *   This can be shown formally using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, where the transition rate is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $|\\langle l_i, m_i, 1, q | l_f, m_f \\rangle|^2$. For the transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$, we have $l_i=0, m_i=0, l_f=1, m_f=m', q=m'$. The coefficient is $|\\langle 0,0,1,m'|1,m' \\rangle|^2 = 1$ for all $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since the rates are equal, and there are three possible channels, the probability for each is $1/3$.\n    *   So, $\\text{BR}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Branching Ratio for Step 2:**\n    *   The intermediate state is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. We need to find all possible E1 decay channels from this state.\n    *   The selection rules require $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. So the final state must have $l=0$ or $l=2$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n_{final} < 2$. The only possibility is $n_{final}=1$.\n    *   For $n=1$, the only possible value for orbital angular momentum is $l=0$.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible decay channel for the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state via a single dipole transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.\n    *   Since this is the only decay path, its branching ratio is 1.\n    *   $\\text{BR}(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Probability and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    *   The probability for any of the three complete cascade paths is:\n        $P(\\text{path via } m') = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   This means each of the three routes is equally likely, with a probability of $1/3$.\n    *   Now, let's examine the options:\n        A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n        B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n        C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n        D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\n    Option D presents one of the three valid routes and provides the correctly calculated probability of $1/3$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
