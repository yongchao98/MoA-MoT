    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being spin-1/2 particles, they are fermions. Identical fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\n2.  **Define Single-Particle Quantum States:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n    *   The energy eigenstates for a single particle are given by the formula:\n        $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n        where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    *   The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    *   So, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n    *   Each particle also has a spin quantum number, $m_s$, which can be either +1/2 (spin up) or -1/2 (spin down).\n    *   Therefore, a complete quantum state is defined by the pair of quantum numbers (n, $m_s$).\n    *   According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy ($E_{GS}$):**\n    To find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n    *   The lowest energy level is n=1. We can place 2 particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy of these two particles is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2)E = 2E$.\n    *   The next lowest energy level is n=2. We place the remaining 2 particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy of these two particles is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2)E = 8E$.\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n        $E_{GS} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$):**\n    The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n    *   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   The new configuration is: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, and 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   The total energy of this state is:\n        $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n        $E_{1st} = (2 \\times 1^2 E) + (1 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 3^2 E)$\n        $E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state and find the second-lowest total energy (after the first excited state).\n    *   **Ground State Configuration:** (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2). Energy = 10E.\n    *   **Excitation 1 (First Excited State):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: (2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n        *   Energy: $2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1)E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n    *   **Excitation 2:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: (1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n        *   Energy: $E_1 + 2E_2 + E_3 = 1(1)E + 2(4)E + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Excitation 3:** Move two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: (2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3).\n        *   Energy: $2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2(1)E + 2(9)E = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   **Excitation 4:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n        *   Configuration: (2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4).\n        *   Energy: $2E_1 + E_2 + E_4 = 2(1)E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\n    Comparing the energies of the excited states: 15E < 18E < 20E < 22E...\n    *   The lowest excited state energy is 15E.\n    *   The second lowest excited state energy is 18E.\n\n6.  **Final Result:**\n    *   Ground State Energy: 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy: 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy: 18E\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\nTo verify the calculations, let's use a simple Python script.\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef calculate_total_energy(configuration):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the total energy for a given particle configuration.\"\"\"\n    total_energy = 0\n    for n in configuration:\n        total_energy += n**2\n    return total_energy\n\ndef find_state_energies(num_particles, num_states_to_find):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the energies of the ground state and first few excited states\n    for a system of spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D infinite potential well.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A state is a list of principal quantum numbers for each particle.\n    # e.g., [1, 1, 2, 2] for the ground state of 4 particles.\n    \n    # We generate combinations of quantum levels 'n' that the particles can occupy.\n    # Since each level 'n' can hold 2 particles, we create a pool of available states.\n    # For example, for levels n=1 to n=5, the pool is [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5]\n    max_n = 10 # Consider levels up to n=10, which is sufficient for low-lying states.\n    state_pool = []\n    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        state_pool.extend([n, n])\n\n    # Find unique configurations of 4 particles from this pool\n    possible_configs = set(itertools.combinations(state_pool, num_particles))\n    \n    # Calculate the energy for each unique configuration\n    config_energies = {}\n    for config in possible_configs:\n        # Sorting the tuple makes it a canonical representation of the configuration\n        sorted_config = tuple(sorted(config))\n        energy = calculate_total_energy(sorted_config)\n        if sorted_config not in config_energies:\n            config_energies[sorted_config] = energy\n\n    # Sort the energies to find the ground and excited states\n    unique_energies = sorted(list(set(config_energies.values())))\n    \n    return unique_energies[:num_states_to_find]\n\n# System parameters\nnum_particles = 4\nnum_states = 3 # Ground, first excited, second excited\n\n# Calculate and print the energies\nenergies = find_state_energies(num_particles, num_states)\n\nprint(f\"Ground state energy: {energies[0]}E\")\nprint(f\"First excited state energy: {energies[1]}E\")\nprint(f\"Second excited state energy: {energies[2]}E\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Identical fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by both the energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and the spin projection (`m_s`, which can be spin up or spin down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L are given by:\n    $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. So, the single-particle energy levels are $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because of spin, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_GS)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1:** Can hold 2 particles. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2)E = 2E$.\n*   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining 2 particles here. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2)E = 8E$.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n\n*   The ground state configuration is (2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2).\n*   The first excited state configuration is (2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3).\n\nThe total energy for this configuration is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times 1^2 E) + (1 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 3^2 E)$\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider the next possible low-energy excitation from the ground state.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (by promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3)\n\nLet's consider the next lowest-energy promotion. We can promote a particle from a lower level (n=1) or promote a particle to a higher level (n=4).\n\n*   **Option A: Promote from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: (1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3).\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1^2 E) + (2 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n\n*   **Option B: Promote from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: (2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4).\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1^2 E) + (1 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 4^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of these possible excited states, the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state has an energy of 18E.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
