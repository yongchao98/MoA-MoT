    "This is a particle physics problem involving an annihilation process. We need to use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to solve for the velocity of the final state particles.\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis:**\nThe initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\nThe problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible. For a collision leading to annihilation, it's reasonable to assume the process is observed from the center-of-mass frame, where the total initial momentum is zero. This simplifies the problem, as we can assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   The rest mass energy of an antiproton is the same, $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton, as their kinetic energies are considered negligible.\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938.3 \\text{ MeV} + 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe total initial momentum ($P_i$) is zero.\n$P_i = 0$.\n\n**2. Final State Analysis:**\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. Since $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ are likely a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$.\nWe are given the rest mass energy of particle A: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\nBy the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum ($P_f$) must also be zero ($P_f = P_i = 0$). For the total momentum to be zero, the four resulting particles must be emitted with velocities that are symmetric in some way. Due to this symmetry and the conservation of energy, each of the four final particles must have the same speed ($v$) and thus the same energy ($E_A$).\n\nThe total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$.\n\n**3. Applying Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation ($E_i = E_f$).\n$1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n$1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\nNow, we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n**4. Calculating the Velocity:**\nThe Lorentz factor is related to the velocity ($v$) by the equation $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$, where $\\beta = v/c$. We can rearrange this to solve for $\\beta$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\gamma$ we found:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSince $\\beta = v/c$, the velocity of particle A is $v = 0.7688c$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.91c\nC) 0.77c\nD) 0.86c\n\nThe calculated value of 0.7688c is closest to 0.77c.\n\n<<<C>>>"
