    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n        *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    To plan a synthesis, we must consider how each substituent directs incoming electrophiles.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies:**\n    The main challenge is introducing the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group at a position that is *meta* to the other two groups. This suggests that the order of reactions is critical.\n\n    Let's consider the final step of the synthesis. Which group should be added last?\n\n    *   **Case 1: Add the acetyl group last (Friedel-Crafts Acylation).**\n        The precursor would be 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. This molecule contains two deactivating groups, one of which is the strongly deactivating nitro group. Friedel-Crafts reactions, including acylation, generally fail on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene and its derivatives. Therefore, this route is not feasible for a high-yield synthesis. The acetyl group must be introduced earlier.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Add the nitro group or the bromo group last.**\n        This means the synthesis must start with the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene.\n        *   **Step 1: Acylation.** Benzene reacts with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form acetophenone.\n            Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n            Now we have the acetyl group on the ring, which is a *meta*-director.\n\n        Now, we need to add the -Br and -NO2 groups to the meta positions (3 and 5). We have two choices for the next step: bromination or nitration.\n\n        *   **Path A: Brominate first, then nitrate.**\n            *   **Step 2a: Bromination.** Acetophenone is treated with Br2 and FeBr3. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine will be added at position 3.\n                Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n            *   **Step 3a: Nitration.** We now nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has an acetyl group (m-director) at position 1 and a bromo group (o,p-director) at position 3.\n                *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n                *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n                *   Both groups are deactivating. Electrophilic attack is generally disfavored at positions ortho to a deactivating group. Position 5 is meta to both substituents and is the least deactivated position. Therefore, nitration will predominantly occur at position 5.\n                3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Target Molecule).\n                This sequence is chemically sound and known to produce the desired product in good yield.\n\n        *   **Path B: Nitrate first, then brominate.**\n            *   **Step 2b: Nitration.** Acetophenone is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the nitro group to position 3.\n                Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone.\n            *   **Step 3b: Bromination.** We now brominate 3-nitroacetophenone. The ring has two *meta*-directing groups at positions 1 (-COCH3) and 3 (-NO2). Both groups reinforce each other, directing the incoming bromo group to position 5.\n                3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Target Molecule).\n                While this path also leads to the correct product, the ring in step 3b is more strongly deactivated (due to -NO2 being more deactivating than -Br) than the ring in step 3a. This would require harsher reaction conditions and likely result in a lower yield. Thus, Path A is the superior \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n4.  **Match the Best Strategy to the Given Options:**\n    The best synthesis route we identified is:\n    i) Acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3)\n    ii) Bromination (Br2/FeBr3)\n    iii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4)\n\n    Let's check the options:\n    *   A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ... — Incorrect start.\n    *   B) **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4** ; iv) Fe/HCl ... — The first three steps perfectly match our optimal synthesis route. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are extraneous and would modify the target molecule, indicating a potential flaw in the question's construction. However, the initial sequence is the only one provided that correctly and efficiently leads to the desired product.\n    *   C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2... — This sequence starts by making benzene from benzene, which is incorrect.\n    *   D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... — This would lead to 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, and subsequent acylation would fail or give the wrong isomer.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Option B is the only choice that begins with the correct, high-yield sequence of reactions to produce 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Despite the superfluous steps listed afterward, the core of the synthesis presented is the most valid among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
