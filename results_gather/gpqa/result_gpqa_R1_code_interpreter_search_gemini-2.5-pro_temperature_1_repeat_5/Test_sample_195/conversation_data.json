    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    The problem involves a conservative force (Hooke's law, $F=-kx$), so the total mechanical energy of the oscillator is conserved. The total mechanical energy is the sum of the kinetic energy (K) and the potential energy (U).\n    $E = K + U = \\text{constant}$\n\n2.  **Define the states of the system.**\n    We need to compare the energy at two specific points in the oscillation:\n    *   **State 1: Maximum displacement.** At this point, the mass is at its maximum amplitude, $x = A$. The mass momentarily stops before changing direction, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    *   **State 2: Equilibrium position.** At this point, the mass is at the center of its oscillation, $x = 0$. The potential energy is at its minimum (zero), and the speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n\n3.  **Write down the energy expressions for each state.**\n    This is a relativistic problem, so we must use the relativistic formula for kinetic energy:\n    $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    The potential energy for a spring system obeying Hooke's law is:\n    $U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n    *   **Energy in State 1 (at x = A):**\n        *   Velocity $v = 0$, which means $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        *   Kinetic energy $K_1 = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\n        *   Potential energy $U_1 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   Total energy $E_1 = K_1 + U_1 = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **Energy in State 2 (at x = 0):**\n        *   Velocity is maximum, $v = v_{max}$. The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   Kinetic energy $K_2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n        *   Potential energy $U_2 = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        *   Total energy $E_2 = K_2 + U_2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy in State 1 must equal the total energy in State 2:\n    $E_1 = E_2$\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.**\n    First, rearrange the equation to solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max} - 1$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we perform the following algebraic steps:\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
