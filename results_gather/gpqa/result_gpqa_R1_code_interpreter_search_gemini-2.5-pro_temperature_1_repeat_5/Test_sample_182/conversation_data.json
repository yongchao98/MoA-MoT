    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant**\n    *   The reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n    *   Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n        *   \"cyclohex-3-ene\": A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n        *   \"carboxylic acid\": This is the principal functional group (-COOH), so it is at position 1.\n        *   \"2-formyl\": An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position 2.\n        *   \"5-vinyl\": A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is at position 5.\n\n    *   The structure is as follows:\n        ```\n              COOH (at C1)\n             /\n        (C1)-- (C2)--CHO\n       /  \\\n     (C6)  (C3)\n      |    ||\n     (C5) --(C4)\n      |\n      CH=CH2\n        ```\n    *   Let's determine the molecular formula of the reactant:\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** Let's count them on the structure.\n            *   H on C1: 1\n            *   H on C2: 1\n            *   H on C3: 1\n            *   H on C4: 1\n            *   H on C5: 1\n            *   H on C6: 2\n            *   H in -COOH: 1\n            *   H in -CHO: 1\n            *   H in -CH=CH2: 3\n            *   Total H = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n    *   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**\n    *   The reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**.\n    *   This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n    *   Specifically, it will cause the following transformations:\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n        *   Aldehyde (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n        *   Alkene (C=C) is reduced to an alkane (C-C).\n    *   The cyclic structure of the alkane is preserved under these conditions.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product**\n    *   The reaction will reduce all the functional groups and double bonds in the starting material without breaking the carbon skeleton.\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced.\n    *   The double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   The formyl group will be reduced to a methyl group.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group will be reduced to a methyl group.\n    *   The resulting product will be a saturated cycloalkane with the same carbon skeleton as the reactant.\n    *   The carbon skeleton is a 6-membered ring with three substituents: two methyl groups and one ethyl group.\n    *   The product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n    *   The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n        IHD = (2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2\n        where C is the number of carbons, N is nitrogens, H is hydrogens, and X is halogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n\n    *   First, let's find the molecular formula of the product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane.\n        *   **Carbon atoms (C):** 6 (in the ring) + 1 (first methyl) + 1 (second methyl) + 2 (ethyl) = 10 carbons.\n        *   The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for such compounds is CnH2n.\n        *   For n=10, the formula is C10H20.\n        *   **Hydrogen atoms (H):** 20.\n    *   Now, we calculate the IHD for the product (C10H20):\n        *   IHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2 = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1.\n\n    *   Alternatively, we can determine the IHD by inspecting the structure of the product:\n        *   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring)\n        *   Number of double bonds = 0\n        *   Number of triple bonds = 0\n        *   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of double bonds) + (Number of triple bonds) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods give an IHD of 1.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
