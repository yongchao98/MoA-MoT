    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe problem involves two different mean free paths:\n*   **λ1:** The mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other.\n*   **λ2:** The mean free path of electrons from the beam colliding with the gas molecules.\n\nThe general formula for the mean free path (λ) is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Expression for λ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collisions)**\n\nFor a gas molecule moving through other identical, moving gas molecules, the kinetic theory of gases introduces a correction factor of √2 to account for the relative motion of the particles.\nThe formula for λ1 is:\nλ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n_gas` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n*   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule.\n\n### **3. Formulate the Expression for λ2 (Electron-Molecule Collisions)**\n\nFor an electron moving through the gas, the situation is different. The electrons are accelerated to 1000 keV, making them relativistic and extremely fast compared to the thermal motion of the gas molecules.\n*   Velocity of a 1000 keV electron is ~0.94c (where c is the speed of light).\n*   Thermal velocity of a gas molecule (e.g., N₂) at room temperature is ~500 m/s.\n\nSince the electrons are vastly faster, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets. Therefore, the √2 correction factor is not needed.\nThe formula for λ2 is:\nλ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_eg)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n_gas` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n*   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n\n### **4. Compare λ1 and λ2**\n\nTo compare λ2 and λ1, let's take their ratio:\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n_gas * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg) / (n_gas * σ_eg)\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n### **5. Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nNow, we need to compare the two cross-sections. We can use a simple hard-sphere model for a first-order approximation.\n*   Let the diameter of a gas molecule be `d_gas` and its radius be `r_gas = d_gas / 2`.\n*   An electron can be considered a point particle (its physical size is negligible in this context).\n\n*   **σ_gg (Molecule-Molecule):** When two identical spheres of radius `r_gas` collide, a collision occurs if their centers come within a distance of `2 * r_gas = d_gas`. The effective target area is a circle of radius `d_gas`.\n    σ_gg = π * (d_gas)² = π * (2 * r_gas)² = 4π(r_gas)²\n\n*   **σ_eg (Electron-Molecule):** When a point-like electron collides with a spherical molecule of radius `r_gas`, a collision occurs if the electron's path comes within a distance `r_gas` of the molecule's center. The effective target area is the geometric cross-section of the molecule.\n    σ_eg = π * (r_gas)²\n\n*   **Ratio of Cross-Sections:**\n    σ_gg / σ_eg = [4π(r_gas)²] / [π(r_gas)²] = 4\n\nThis simple model shows that the collision cross-section for two molecules is about 4 times larger than that for an electron and a molecule.\n\n### **6. Calculate the Ratio of Mean Free Paths**\n\nNow substitute the cross-section ratio back into our equation for the MFP ratio:\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\nλ2 / λ1 ≈ √2 * 4 = 4√2\nλ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nSo, **λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1**.\n\nThis indicates that the mean free path for an electron is significantly *longer* than the mean free path for a gas molecule under the same conditions. This is due to two factors:\n1.  The absence of the √2 factor for electron collisions (a factor of ~1.41 increase).\n2.  The smaller collision cross-section for the electron (a factor of 4 increase in the hard-sphere model).\n\n### **7. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe have concluded that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1 (λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1). Let's review the given options:\nA) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (Incorrect)\nB) λ2 < λ1 (Incorrect)\nC) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, our result is much larger)\nD) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct)\n\nOur calculated result, λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1, satisfies the condition λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. Even if we only consider the √2 factor and assume the cross-sections are equal (which is physically an underestimate), we would get λ2 ≈ 1.41 * λ1, which also satisfies λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. Therefore, option D is the only logical conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>"
