    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one:** This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group (C=O). This type of cyclic ester is called a delta-lactone (δ-lactone).\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to position 4 of the ring. According to IUPAC nomenclature for heterocycles, the oxygen atom is position 1, and the carbonyl carbon is position 2. Therefore, the ethyl group is at the carbon in the gamma (γ) position relative to the carbonyl group.\n*   **Chiral Center:** The carbon at position 4 is bonded to four different groups (a hydrogen, an ethyl group, and two different parts of the ring), making it a chiral center. The product is specified as either the (R) or (S) enantiomer.\n*   **Formation:** Delta-lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of delta-hydroxy carboxylic acids (5-hydroxy carboxylic acids). The precursor for our product must be 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center in this precursor is at C-3, which becomes C-4 in the final lactone product. The stereochemistry (R/S configuration) is retained during this cyclization.\n\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH   --(H+, heat)-->   (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one) + H₂O\n    (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid)                 (δ-lactone)\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provided for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's break down this structure:\n*   It is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid).\n*   It has two carboxyl-type functional groups: one is a free **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) and the other is an **isobutyl ester** (-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   It has an ethyl group at position 3, which is the chiral center.\n*   The structure is: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl.\n\nThis starting material has both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The key to solving the problem lies in the chemoselectivity of the two different reducing agents.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols but is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu   --(LiBH₄)-->   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the configuration of the chiral center at C-3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A is the same as the stereochemistry of the product lactone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a selective reducing agent known for its high reactivity towards carboxylic acids. It reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the isobutyl ester group untouched.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu   --(BH₃)-->   HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu\n    2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the stable six-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reaction steps do not alter the configuration of the chiral center. The stereochemistry of starting material B is the same as that of the product lactone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches the description in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
