    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the chromatographic analyses.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                   \\ /\n                    C=C\n                   / \\\n                  H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning both new C-O bonds are formed on the same face of the double bond.\n        *   The *syn*-addition of an epoxide to a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetric, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction that proceeds with backside attack, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of epoxidation (*syn*-addition) followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (*anti*-opening) is stereochemically equivalent to a direct *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene produces a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol** ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol). This product is achiral.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\ /\n                    C=C\n                   / \\\n                  H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a racemic mixture.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the relationships between these stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will therefore have different retention times and separate into distinct peaks. The meso-diol will be separated from the other two.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated by an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   This allows for the separation of **enantiomers** because they interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   A chiral column can also separate **diastereomers**.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
