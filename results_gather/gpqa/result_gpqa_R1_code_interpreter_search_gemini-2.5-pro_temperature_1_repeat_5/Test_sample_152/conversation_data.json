    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Step 1: Formation of the Nucleophile (Michael Donor).**\n    Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate. This carbon is particularly acidic because its conjugate base (the enolate) is stabilized by resonance across two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    `CH2(COOMe)2 + NaOEt <=> [Na]⁺[⁻CH(COOMe)2] + EtOH`\n    The nucleophile is the malonate enolate, `⁻CH(COOMe)2`.\n*   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition).**\n    The Michael acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`. The nucleophile attacks the electrophilic β-carbon.\n    The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon, and the π electrons shift to form a new enolate intermediate.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe + ⁻CH(COOMe)2 → p-Tolyl-CH(β)(CH(COOMe)2)-C⁻H(α)-COOMe`\n*   **Step 3: Protonation.**\n    The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final neutral product (A).\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)2)-C⁻H-COOMe + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)2)-CH2-COOMe + EtO⁻`\n*   **Step 4: Naming the Product (A).**\n    The structure of the product is `(MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH2-COOMe`.\n    Let's analyze the names provided in the options, which use a common (non-systematic IUPAC) \"propane-tricarboxylate\" nomenclature.\n    -   `propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` refers to a three-carbon chain with two carboxylate groups on C1 and one on C3: `(MeOOC)2CH-CH2-CH2-COOMe`.\n    -   Placing a `p-tolyl` group at the C2 position gives `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    -   The structure for this name is `(MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH2-COOMe`.\n    -   This structure exactly matches the product we derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, followed by workup with MeOH and H3O⁺.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which involves a Michael addition of an enamine followed by hydrolysis.\n*   **Step 1: Formation and Reaction of the Nucleophile.**\n    1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral but strongly nucleophilic at their β-carbon (the carbon that was the α-carbon of the original ketone). This enamine acts as the Michael donor.\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition.**\n    The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`). The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n*   **Step 3: Protonation and Hydrolysis.**\n    The intermediate is protonated and then hydrolyzed by the acidic workup (H3O⁺). Hydrolysis of the iminium ion regenerates the ketone (cyclohexanone). The overall result is the addition of the butenenitrile-derived group to the α-carbon of cyclohexanone.\n*   **Step 4: Identifying the Product (B).**\n    -   The bond forms between the α-carbon of cyclohexanone (C2) and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    -   The fragment from but-2-enenitrile, after addition and protonation, is `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n    -   This group is attached to C2 of the cyclohexanone ring.\n    -   The final product is a substituted cyclohexanone. To name it, we can treat the butanenitrile as the parent chain.\n    -   Parent chain: butanenitrile (`NC-C1-C2-C3-C4`).\n    -   The structure is `NC-CH2-CH(cyclohexanone)-CH3`. Numbering from the nitrile group (`CN` is C1), the substituent is at C3. The substituent is the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    -   Thus, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The acidic workup ensures the final product is the keto form, not the enol form (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`).\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** An unknown compound C and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition, but we need to identify one of the starting materials (a retro-synthesis problem).\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure.**\n    The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    -   The `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is the six-membered ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3.\n    -   The `(3-oxobutyl)` group has the structure `-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    -   This group is attached at the C2 position of the dione ring, which is the acidic carbon located between the two carbonyls.\n*   **Step 2: Deconstruct the Michael Addition.**\n    A Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    -   The acceptor is given as but-3-en-2-one (MVK): `CH2(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    -   After the reaction, this fragment becomes `-CH2(β)-CH2(α)-C(=O)-CH3`, which is precisely the `(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product.\n    -   This means the bond was formed between the C2 of the donor ring and the β-carbon (CH2) of MVK.\n*   **Step 3: Identify Reactant C.**\n    The donor must be the molecule that provides the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` part. The reaction is carried out in base (KOH), which deprotonates the most acidic proton. The C2 proton of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is highly acidic and readily forms an enolate, which is a potent Michael donor.\n    Therefore, reactant **C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   **B** is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds exactly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
