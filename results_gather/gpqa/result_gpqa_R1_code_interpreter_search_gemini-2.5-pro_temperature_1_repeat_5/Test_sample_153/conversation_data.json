    "*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the intensities of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n    *   This characteristic 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks is a strong indicator for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the proposed structures, assuming one chlorine atom. The formula for all options A, B, C, and D is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight (using ³⁵Cl) = (7 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.01) + (1 * 35.45) + (2 * 16.00) ≈ 156.5 g/mol. The integer mass is 156.\n    *   Molecular Weight (using ³⁷Cl) = (7 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.01) + (1 * 37.45) + (2 * 16.00) ≈ 158.5 g/mol. The integer mass is 158.\n    *   All four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is right in the range for a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (typically 1710-1680 cm⁻¹).\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This rules out option A (aldehyde/phenol) and option D (chloroformate), as they would not have the characteristic broad O-H peak of a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (highly deshielded) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. Its integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (due to rapid exchange and no adjacent protons) confirms this assignment.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a *para*- (1,4-) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the ring makes the two protons on one side equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n        *   This pattern eliminates 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B), which is *ortho*-disubstituted and would show a more complex splitting pattern with four unique aromatic protons.\n        *   This pattern perfectly matches 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C). The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom are at a slightly higher field (7.72 ppm).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   The MS data indicates a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n    *   The IR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR data confirms the carboxylic acid proton and indicates a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C) is consistent with all three pieces of spectral data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
