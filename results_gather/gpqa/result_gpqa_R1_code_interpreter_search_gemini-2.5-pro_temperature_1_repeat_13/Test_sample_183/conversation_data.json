    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's visualize the structure:\n- A benzene ring.\n- An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at position 1.\n- A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2.\n- A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3 arrangement (vicinal).\n- The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are ortho to each other.\n- The tert-butyl and nitro groups are ortho to each other.\n- The ethoxy and nitro groups are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), the existing substituents on the ring direct the position of new substituents.\n- **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n- **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Weakly activating, ortho,para-director. It is very bulky, so it sterically hinders the ortho positions.\n- **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n- **Amino (-NH2):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n- **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe need to find a sequence that logically arranges these groups in the correct 1,2,3 pattern.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`\n    - Step (i) produces nitrobenzene. The nitro group is strongly deactivating.\n    - Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene. Therefore, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    - Step (iv) uses `NaNO2/HCl`, which is for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2).\n    - The product after step (iii) is a nitrobenzenesulfonic acid derivative, which does not have an amino group. Therefore, this step is chemically nonsensical in this position. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** This option starts with a blocking group strategy, which is a valid approach for controlling regiochemistry.\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation. The t-butyl group is o,p-directing, but its bulkiness strongly favors substitution at the para position. Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\n    iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. The t-butyl group (o,p) and sulfonic acid group (m) both direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the t-butyl group. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a good regioselective step.\n    iv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group. Product: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This step is problematic. Applying a nitrating mixture to this diazonium salt is not a standard reaction. It might be intended to be an ipso-nitration (replacing -SO3H with -NO2) or nitration of the ring, but this would be complex and is unlikely to proceed as needed. The subsequent steps don't clarify the purpose. This path is synthetically unclear.\n\n*   **Option C:** Let's analyze this path carefully.\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. The para product is major due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group. Product: **4-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n    iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. Product: **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. This is a critical step. Aniline is basic and in strong acid (H2SO4), it is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n        - The anilinium ion is a **meta-director**. It directs the incoming nitro group to the position meta to itself (position 3).\n        - The t-butyl group at position 4 is an **ortho,para-director**. It directs to position 2.\n        - The directors are in conflict. This reaction would produce a mixture of 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline and **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**. For the sake of finding a viable path, let's follow the path of the 3-nitro isomer, which is necessary to achieve the final 1,2,3-pattern relative to the introduced oxygen.\n    v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group in 3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline. Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenyldiazonium chloride**.\n    vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. The acidic phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether. Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    - Let's determine the IUPAC name of this product. The lowest locant set is {1,2,4} (by numbering from the carbon ortho to both nitro and t-butyl). The alphabetical substituents are tert-butyl, ethoxy, nitro. This gives the name **1-tert-butyl-4-ethoxy-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion Re-evaluation:**\n\nThere appears to be a flaw in the question, as a rigorous analysis shows that none of the options directly lead to the named target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The product from the most plausible synthetic route (Option C) is an isomer of the target.\n\nHowever, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, we must select the \"best\" or most intended answer.\n- Options A and D contain chemically invalid steps.\n- Option B contains a non-standard and unclear step (vi).\n- Option C outlines a logical, albeit not perfectly regioselective, sequence of standard organic reactions (alkylation, nitration, reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, ether synthesis) that builds a complex trisubstituted benzene. Steps (i) through (vii) form a coherent synthesis of an isomer of the target. The final two steps (viii and ix) are superfluous and likely an error in the question's construction.\n\nGiven the choices, Option C represents the most plausible synthetic design, assuming there is an error in the name of the target molecule in the question prompt. The sequence of reaction types is the most logical for the synthesis of such a molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>"
