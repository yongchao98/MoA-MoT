    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Key Concepts**\n\n*   We have two inertial frames of reference: the Galaxy's frame (let's call it S) and the supernova ejecta's frame (let's call it S').\n*   The ejecta (S') is moving relative to the Galaxy (S). This means we need to apply the principles of Special Relativity.\n*   The question asks for a distance traveled in one frame (the Galaxy's) based on a time interval measured in another frame (the ejecta's). This points specifically to the concept of **time dilation**.\n\n**2. Define the Given Variables**\n\n*   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n*   The time interval measured in the ejecta's reference frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the **proper time**, as it's measured by a clock that is moving along with the ejecta.\n\n**3. State the Goal**\n\n*   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. Let's call this distance `Δx`.\n\n**4. Apply the Relevant Physics Formulas**\n\n*   The distance `Δx` traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity `v` multiplied by the time `Δt` that has passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    `Δx = v * Δt`\n\n*   According to the theory of Special Relativity, time passes differently in frames that are moving relative to each other. This effect is called time dilation. The time `Δt` measured in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) is related to the proper time `Δt₀` measured in the moving frame (the ejecta) by the following formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\n*   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (β).**\n    `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    This tells us that while 50 seconds passed for the ejecta, a slightly longer time passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled (Δx) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    We substitute the expression for `Δt` into our distance formula:\n    `Δx = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    `Δx = 60,000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    `Δx = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `Δx = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n*   **Step 5: Compute the final value.**\n    We can use a calculator or a simple script to find the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndelta_t0 = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Classical distance (without relativity) for comparison\nclassical_distance = v * delta_t0\n# print(f\"Classical distance: {classical_distance} km\")\n\n# Relativistic calculation\nbeta = v / c\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t0\nrelativistic_distance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(f\"{relativistic_distance:.0f}\")\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n```\n3061862\n```\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. Looking at the options provided:\nA) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer if we ignored relativity)\nB) 2,940,000 km\nC) 3,060,000 km\nD) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to option C. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options. Therefore, 3,060,000 km is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires the application of the principles of Special Relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S). This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (S'). This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **List the given information:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (the proper time), `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this `d`. The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Time Dilation formula:**\n    *   An observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) will measure time passing more slowly for the moving ejecta (S'). The relationship between the time interval in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt₀`) is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n6.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    *   This means that while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame would measure about 51.031 seconds passing.\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   `d = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n8.  **Compare with the options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km (This is the non-relativistic answer)\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of approximately 3,061,860 km is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
