    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State and Given Information\n*   Initial nucleus is at rest.\n*   Initial rest-mass energy, $E_0 = M c^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   Mass relationship: The more massive fragment is $m_1$, and $m_1 = 2 m_2$.\n*   Sum of final rest-masses: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\nWe have a system of two equations for $m_1$ and $m_2$:\n1.  $m_1 = 2 m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2 m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M$\n$3 m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M$\n\nNow find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2 m_2 = 2 \\times (0.33 M) = 0.66 M$\n\nLet's convert these masses into their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$):\n    $m_1 c^2 = 0.66 \\times (M c^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment ($m_2$):\n    $m_2 c^2 = 0.33 \\times (M c^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy is conserved. The initial energy is the rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus, $M c^2$. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the two fragments ($E_1 + E_2$). The total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest-mass energy and its kinetic energy ($E = mc^2 + T$).\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $M c^2 = (m_1 c^2 + T_1) + (m_2 c^2 + T_2)$\n    The total kinetic energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is:\n    $Q = T_1 + T_2 = M c^2 - (m_1 + m_2) c^2$\n    $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n    $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    $\\vec{p}_{initial} = 0 \\implies \\vec{p}_{final} = \\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 = 0$\n    This means the two fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum:\n    $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Kinetic Energy ($T_1$)\n\nWe need to calculate $T_1$, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, using both classical and relativistic formulas.\n\n#### a) Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n*   $T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$\n*   $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1}$\nSince $m_1 = 2m_2$, the ratio is:\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies T_2 = 2T_1$\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy, $Q = T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$:\n$T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1, class} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n#### b) Correct Relativistic Calculation\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\nWe can express the momentum term as $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$.\nSubstituting $E = T + mc^2$:\n$(pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2 + (mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$.\n\nSince $p_1 = p_2$, we have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1 c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2 c^2)$\n\nNow, we substitute $T_2 = Q - T_1 = 3 - T_1$, and the rest-mass energy values ($m_1c^2=198$ GeV, $m_2c^2=99$ GeV):\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$\n$T_1^2 + 396 T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198T_1)$\nCancel the $T_1^2$ term from both sides:\n$396 T_1 = 9 - 6T_1 + 594 - 198T_1$\n$396 T_1 = 603 - 204T_1$\nCombine the $T_1$ terms:\n$396 T_1 + 204 T_1 = 603$\n$600 T_1 = 603$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n$\\Delta T_1 = T_{1, rel} - T_{1, class}$\n$\\Delta T_1 = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV}$\n$\\Delta T_1 = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV.\n\n# Given initial rest-mass energy\nMc2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate rest-mass energies of the fragments m1 and m2\n# m1 = 2 * m2\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# 3 * m2 = 0.99 * M => m2 = 0.33 * M\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\n\n# Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation for T1 ---\n# In the classical approximation, T is proportional to 1/m for a given momentum.\n# T1 / T2 = m2 / m1 = 1/2 => T2 = 2 * T1\n# T1 + T2 = Q => T1 + 2 * T1 = Q => 3 * T1 = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation for T1 ---\n# The energy-momentum relation is (pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2).\n# Since momenta are equal, p1^2 = p2^2:\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c2\n# Substitute T2 = Q - T1:\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*m2c2\n# Solving this equation for T1 gives:\n# T1 * (2*m1c2 + 2*m2c2 + 2*Q) = Q^2 + 2*Q*m2c2\nT1_relativistic = (Q**2 + 2 * Q * m2c2) / (2 * (m1c2 + m2c2) + 2 * Q)\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV\ndifference_in_MeV = (T1_relativistic - T1_classical) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_in_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n```\n> Classical T1: 1.0000 GeV\n> Relativistic T1: 1.0050 GeV\n> Difference: 5.0 MeV\n\nThe calculation confirms that the difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus with rest-mass energy $E_0 = M c^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$ is initially at rest. It fissions into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n\n**1. Determine the rest-masses of the fragments.**\n\nWe are given:\n*   $m_1 = 2 m_2$ (one fragment is twice as massive as the other)\n*   $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$ (the sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass)\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2 m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3 m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M$\nThen, find the mass of the more massive fragment, $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2 m_2 = 2(0.33 M) = 0.66 M$\n\nLet's express these in terms of rest-mass energy (in GeV):\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$):\n    $m_1 c^2 = 0.66 \\times (M c^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment ($m_2$):\n    $m_2 c^2 = 0.33 \\times (M c^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws.**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy is the rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus, $M c^2$. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the fragments ($E_1 + E_2$), where $E = mc^2 + T$. The difference between the initial and final rest-mass energy is converted into the total kinetic energy ($Q$) of the fragments.\n    $Q = T_1 + T_2 = E_{initial, rest} - E_{final, rest}$\n    $Q = (M c^2) - (m_1 c^2 + m_2 c^2)$\n    $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. The two fragments must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum ($p_1 = p_2 = p$).\n\n**3. Calculate the Kinetic Energy of the More Massive Fragment ($T_1$).**\n\n*   **Classical (Non-relativistic) Calculation:**\n    The kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$. Since the momenta are equal:\n    $T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$.\n    The ratio of their kinetic energies is inversely proportional to their masses:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33 M}{0.66 M} = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies T_2 = 2T_1$.\n    Using the total kinetic energy $Q = T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$:\n    $T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1, class} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n*   **Correct Relativistic Calculation:**\n    The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. We can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$. Since $E = T + mc^2$:\n    $(pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$.\n    Since the momenta are equal ($p_1 = p_2$), we have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n    $T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n    We know $T_2 = Q - T_1 = 3 - T_1$. We also have $m_1c^2=198$ GeV and $m_2c^2=99$ GeV. Substitute these values into the equation:\n    $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$\n    $T_1^2 + 396 T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198T_1)$\n    The $T_1^2$ terms cancel out:\n    $396 T_1 = 9 - 6T_1 + 594 - 198T_1$\n    $396 T_1 = 603 - 204T_1$\n    $396 T_1 + 204 T_1 = 603$\n    $600 T_1 = 603$\n    $T_{1, rel} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4. Find the difference.**\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n$\\Delta T_1 = T_{1, rel} - T_{1, class} = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
