    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible isomers, known as tautomers. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at opposite positions (1 and 4). The carbons alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds. These alpha-carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups. Each of these carbons is alpha to two carbonyl groups. The hydrogen atoms on these carbons are highly acidic and can easily participate in tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is in equilibrium with its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and very stable compound. Thus, it shows significant tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bearing the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since this carbon is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid). Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond. The molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry passing through the C=C bond. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on the original. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is benzoquinone.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
