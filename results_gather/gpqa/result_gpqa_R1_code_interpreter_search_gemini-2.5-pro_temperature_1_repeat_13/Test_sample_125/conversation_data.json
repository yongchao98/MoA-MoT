    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position, and it is provided as a pure enantiomer (S).\n    The structure is: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    The chiral center is C5.\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The starting material already has a stereocenter at C5 ((S)-configuration). The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 can result in either an (R) or (S) configuration at the new stereocenter. This leads to the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Because the reaction occurs under the influence of an existing chiral center, these two diastereomers will be formed in unequal amounts (this is known as asymmetric induction). However, for the purpose of counting peaks, we know that two distinct compounds are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    The structure is: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃. We need to consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through C3) and is an achiral **meso compound**. (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound.\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** Since the starting material and the reagent (NaBH₄) are both achiral, the reaction cannot favor one enantiomer over the other. Therefore, the chiral products, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), will be formed in equal amounts, creating a **racemic mixture**. The meso compound will also be formed.\n*   So, Reaction II produces a mixture of three stereoisomers: the racemic pair of enantiomers and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions:\n*   From Rxn I: Two diastereomers ((3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol).\n*   From Rxn II: Three stereoisomers ((2R, 4R)-, (2S, 4S)-, and meso-pentane-2,4-diol).\n\nThe products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) have different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. Therefore, no product from Reaction I will co-elute (have the same retention time) with any product from Reaction II on any HPLC column. We can simply add the number of peaks from each reaction's products.\n\n**Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   It can separate diastereomers because they have different physical properties (including polarity).\n*   It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Peaks from Rxn I:** The two diastereomers will have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Peaks from Rxn II:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have a different polarity, thus eluting as a separate peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis on Chiral HPLC:**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase.\n*   It is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Peaks from Rxn I:** The two diastereomers will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Peaks from Rxn II:** The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)). The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated. This gives **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
