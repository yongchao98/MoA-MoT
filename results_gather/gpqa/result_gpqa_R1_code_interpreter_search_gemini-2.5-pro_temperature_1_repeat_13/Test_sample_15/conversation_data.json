    "To determine if a compound exhibits optical activity, we need to assess whether it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means the molecule lacks any improper axis of rotation, which includes a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H on C1; C(methyl), C(ethyl) on C2) lie in the same plane. The molecule has a plane of symmetry which is the plane of the molecule itself. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral, optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The core `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione` is a saturated derivative related to the Diels-Alder adduct of furan and maleic anhydride. This parent core structure is a meso compound; it has stereocenters (3a and 7a) but possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereocenters are designated (3aR, 7aS), which is characteristic of a meso compound. However, there is a substituent on the methano bridge (C8): `8-(chloromethylene)`, which is an =CHCl group. The plane of symmetry in the parent molecule passes through this C8 bridge atom. The substituent =CHCl is not symmetric (H ≠ Cl). Therefore, the introduction of this group destroys the plane of symmetry of the parent molecule. The resulting molecule is chiral. The name `(3aR,7aS,E)-...` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral compound. Single enantiomers are optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral, optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH₃, COOH, and the other -CH(CH₃)COOH group). When the two stereocenters in such a molecule have opposite configurations (one R, one S), the compound is a meso form. A meso compound has a plane of symmetry (in its eclipsed conformation) or a center of inversion (in its staggered conformation). Due to this internal symmetry, it is achiral despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral (meso), optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The stereocenters have the same configuration (both R). This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It has a non-superimposable mirror image, which is the (2S,3S) isomer. These two form a pair of enantiomers. As a single enantiomer, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral, optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name specifies the (R) configuration, which indicates we are dealing with a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The carbon atom C1 is a stereocenter because the four groups attached to it are different: -OH, -H, the path -CH₂-CH=CH- (from C2 to C3), and the path -CH₂-CH₂-CH= (from C6 to C5). The molecule lacks any element of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral, optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation implies that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's visualize the molecule with all three -OH groups pointing \"up\". This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) perpendicular to the ring. More importantly, it has three vertical planes of symmetry (σᵥ). Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H bond. The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral, optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to look for any source of chirality. There are no stereocenters in the molecule. The carbon in the CH(CH₃)₂ group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. All other sp³ carbons are CH₂ groups or part of the symmetric cyclopentyl ring system connected to the carbonyl. The molecule is flexible due to rotation around single bonds, and it can adopt conformations that have a plane of symmetry. For instance, a plane can contain the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisect both the cyclopentyl ring and the isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral, optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Optically active (chiral) compounds:\n    - (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    - (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    - (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n- Optically inactive (achiral) compounds:\n    - (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    - (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    - (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    - 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
