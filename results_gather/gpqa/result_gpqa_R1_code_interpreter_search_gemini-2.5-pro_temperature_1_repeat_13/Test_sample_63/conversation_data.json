    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data to identify the products of the decomposition.**\n    *   The initial sample is a 7.20 g equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B.\n    *   Heating this mixture produces only gases.\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through three tubes sequentially.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent. It absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The mass of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen that reacted. The problem states CuO is formed (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO), confirming this reaction.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C must be inert as it did not react with the drying agent, the alkaline solution, or the hot copper. Given that we started with salts that decompose on heating, a very likely candidate for this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Verify the composition and mass balance.**\n    *   Let's assume Gas C is N₂. We can calculate the total mass of the gaseous products and see if it matches the initial mass of the salts.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This total mass exactly matches the initial mass of the mixture of salts A and B. This confirms that H₂O, O₂, and N₂ are the only products and our calculations are correct.\n\n3.  **Determine the elemental composition of the initial mixture.**\n    *   Since mass is conserved, all atoms in the products must have come from the original salts A and B.\n    *   Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms = (moles of H₂O) + 2 × (moles of O₂) = 0.20 mol + 2 × 0.025 mol = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   The initial mixture contains 0.40 mol of H, 0.25 mol of O, and 0.20 mol of N.\n\n4.  **Identify the salts A and B.**\n    *   The problem states that the mixture of A and B is equimolar. Let's say we have *n* moles of salt A and *n* moles of salt B.\n    *   The total number of moles of atoms in the mixture is (0.40 H + 0.25 O + 0.20 N).\n    *   Let's find the ratio of elements in the combined \"formula\" of (A+B).\n    *   Ratio N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   To get small integers, we can divide by the smallest number (0.20):\n        *   N: 0.20 / 0.20 = 1\n        *   H: 0.40 / 0.20 = 2\n        *   O: 0.25 / 0.20 = 1.25\n    *   To make these whole numbers, we multiply by 4:\n        *   N: 1 × 4 = 4\n        *   H: 2 × 4 = 8\n        *   O: 1.25 × 4 = 5\n    *   This means that the combined chemical formula for one unit of A and one unit of B is N₄H₈O₅.\n    *   We need to find two common salts (likely ammonium salts, given the products) that add up to this formula. Let's consider ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n        *   Formula of NH₄NO₃: N₂H₄O₃\n        *   Formula of NH₄NO₂: N₂H₄O₂\n    *   Let's add these two formulas together:\n        *   (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅\n    *   This is a perfect match. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the number of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms in the formulas of salts A and B is 17.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 15\nB) 13\nC) 17\nD) 19\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
