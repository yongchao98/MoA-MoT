    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. It involves the formation of an enolate from a ketone, which then acts as a nucleophile and attacks an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is the source of the nucleophile (enolate).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is the electrophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base used to deprotonate the ketone to form the enolate.\n\n3.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, removes an acidic α-proton from the ketone. The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 carbon is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has **no** α-protons.\n    *   The C6 carbon is tertiary (bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen) and has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, forming the corresponding enolate. The steric bulk of the base is irrelevant here as there is only one possible site for enolization.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. This is a 1,4-conjugate addition.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   Subsequent protonation (work-up, usually with a mild acid or water) of the intermediate enolate yields the final product.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Product A Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The resulting product has an `-(CH₂CH₂COOEt)` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   Let's name this product according to the convention used in the options, i.e., as an `ethyl propanoate` derivative.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment is designated as C1'. The principal functional group on the ring (the ketone) should have the lowest possible number, which is C2'.\n    *   The substituents on the cyclohexyl ring are:\n        *   A methyl group at C1' (originally C6).\n        *   An oxo group at C2' (originally C1).\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at C3' (originally C2).\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents gives the name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. A carbanion stabilized by a nitro group (a nitronate ion) acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (α-carbon) are acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). This base deprotonates the nitroalkane.\n\n3.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   KOH removes a proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion.\n    *   `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + KOH → [CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂ ↔ CH₃CH₂CH=N⁺O₂⁻] K⁺ + H₂O`\n\n4.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water in the reaction mixture.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Product B Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so this carbon is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 has six carbons, so the parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nThe calculated products match option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
