    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2], we need to calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n### 1. Define the species and equilibria\n\nThe cobalt(II) ions, Co²⁺, react with thiocyanate ions, SCN⁻, to form a series of complexes:\n1.  Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺\n2.  Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]\n3.  Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n4.  Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (β):\n*   β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n*   β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n*   β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n*   β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n### 2. Express concentrations in terms of [Co²⁺]\n\nWe can rearrange the stability constant expressions to find the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt(II) ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the free thiocyanate ion concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n### 3. Formulate the total cobalt concentration\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nSubstituting the expressions from step 2:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nFactoring out [Co²⁺]:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n### 4. Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex\n\nThe fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nSubstituting the expressions from the previous steps:\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNote that the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not needed to calculate the percentage, as we are calculating a relative fraction. We only need the equilibrium concentration of the ligand, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.\n\n### 5. Substitute the given values and calculate\n\nGiven values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator (let's call it `S`):\nS = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\nS = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nS = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nS = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nS = 2.3646\n\nNext, calculate the numerator:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]²\nNumerator = 40 × (0.1)²\nNumerator = 40 × 0.01\nNumerator = 0.4\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = Numerator / S = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo find the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = α₂ × 100%\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100% = 16.916%\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nSCN_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# The denominator of the fraction formula\n# S = 1 + beta1*[SCN] + beta2*[SCN]^2 + beta3*[SCN]^3 + beta4*[SCN]^4\ndenominator = (1 +\n               beta1 * SCN_conc**1 +\n               beta2 * SCN_conc**2 +\n               beta3 * SCN_conc**3 +\n               beta4 * SCN_conc**4)\n\n# The numerator for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)2]\n# Numerator = beta2 * [SCN]^2\nnumerator_alpha2 = beta2 * SCN_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator_alpha2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\npercentage=16.916180326482278\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This fraction is often denoted as α₂.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free Co²⁺ ions and all the complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` and the free thiocyanate ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`:\n*   `[Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nSubstituting these into the total concentration equation and factoring out `[Co²⁺]` gives:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato complex is `[Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, so the fraction depends only on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40`\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n\nCalculate the numerator:\nNumerator = `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nCalculate the denominator:\nDenominator = `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\nDenominator = `2.3646`\n\nCalculate the fraction α₂:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%. The calculation from the code interpreter confirms this result (`percentage=16.91618...`).\n\n<<<C>>>"
