    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the charge distribution:**\n    *   We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero.\n    *   A positive charge, `+q`, is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n    *   **Induction on the inner surface:** This positive charge `+q` will attract the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the surface of the cavity. This creates an induced charge of `-q` on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this `-q` charge on the inner surface will be non-uniform, arranged in such a way as to cancel the electric field of the `+q` charge for all points inside the conductor's material.\n    *   **Induction on the outer surface:** Since the conductor was initially neutral, and a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a net positive charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere in the conductor to maintain charge conservation. This excess positive charge (`+q`) will reside on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principle of Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    *   A fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero.\n    *   The arrangement of the `+q` charge inside the cavity and the induced `-q` charge on the inner surface is such that their combined electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity, specifically within the conducting material.\n    *   This means the conductor \"shields\" the outside region from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity. The only thing that an outside observer \"sees\" is the net effect of the charge on the outer surface.\n\n3.  **Determine the field outside the conductor:**\n    *   The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is solely due to the charge distribution on the outer surface.\n    *   We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges in the vicinity, this `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to minimize electrostatic repulsion.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is at O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by the formula for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{(distance)}^2}$\n    *   Substituting the values:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The information regarding the cavity's position (`s`), the distance from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `Î¸` is extraneous. Due to electrostatic shielding, the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor, not on the specific arrangement of charges inside the cavity.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - This matches our derivation.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
