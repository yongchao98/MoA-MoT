    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of H is `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H))`.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the mass fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   14.28% is approximately 0.142857, which is equal to 1/7.\n    *   So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` => `7y = 12x + y` => `6y = 12x` => `y = 2x`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12), methylcyclohexane (C7H14), etc. Both fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Identify the Carbon Skeleton.**\n    *   Mixture X (containing two liquids, A and B) and mixture Y (containing two liquids, C and D) can both be hydrogenated under severe conditions to produce *only* substance Z.\n    *   This is a crucial piece of information. It means that all four compounds (A, B, C, D) and Z share the same carbon skeleton. For example, if Z is cyclohexane, then A, B, C, and D must all be compounds with a six-membered carbon ring.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y.**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is the cycloalkane Z.\n    *   The other component of Y must also have the same carbon skeleton and be saturated or aromatic. For its hydrogenation to also yield Z, it must be an aromatic compound corresponding to Z.\n    *   Let's assume the simplest case for the carbon skeleton, a 6-membered ring. This makes Z **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6 + 3H2) yields cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {**Benzene (C6H6)**, **Cyclohexane (C6H12)**}. This fits all the descriptions for Y.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B, which decolorizes bromine water (so they are unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   X is converted to Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. The reaction is described as a disproportionation.\n    *   Since an equimolar mixture X yields an equimolar mixture Y, the reaction is most likely an intermolecular hydrogen transfer with 1:1 stoichiometry: A + B → C + D.\n    *   In our case: A + B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   This is a redox reaction where one molecule is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene, and the other is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane.\n        *   Oxidation: A → C6H6\n        *   Reduction: B → C6H12\n    *   A and B must be unsaturated C6 ring compounds. Possible candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of atoms must balance: Formula(A) + Formula(B) = C6H6 + C6H12 = C12H18.\n    *   If we choose A = **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)** and B = **cyclohexene (C6H10)**, the sum is C12H18.\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen transfer:\n        *   C6H8 → C6H6 + 2H (loses 2 hydrogen atoms)\n        *   C6H10 + 2H → C6H12 (gains 2 hydrogen atoms)\n        *   The hydrogen transfer is balanced.\n    *   Let's check the final conditions for X:\n        *   Are they liquids? Yes (BP of cyclohexene is 83°C, cyclohexa-1,4-diene is 26°C).\n        *   Do they decolorize bromine water? Yes, both have double bonds.\n        *   Are there conjugated multiple bonds? Cyclohexene has one double bond. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene has two double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated. This condition is satisfied.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   Mixture X consists of two liquids: Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) and Cyclohexene (C6H10).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of C6H8 = 8.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of C6H10 = 10.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis solution is consistent with all the facts presented in the problem. The C7 case (involving toluene and methylcyclohexane) also appears consistent, leading to an answer of 22. However, the C6 case represents the simplest and most fundamental chemical system that fits the description, and it is common for such problems to refer to the parent system unless specified otherwise.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>"
