    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the chemical formula and the number of each type of bond in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Count Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2C= : 1 C in the chain + 2 C in methyl groups = 3 C\n    *   =CH- : 1 C\n    *   -CH2- : 1 C\n    *   -CH(CH3)- : 1 C in the chain + 1 C in a methyl group = 2 C\n    *   -CH2- : 1 C\n    *   -CH= : 1 C\n    *   =C(CH3)2 : 1 C in the chain + 2 C in methyl groups = 3 C\n    *   Total C atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 C\n\n*   **Count Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2C= : 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   =CH- : 1 H\n    *   -CH2- : 2 H\n    *   -CH(CH3)- : 1 H on the chain + 3 H in the methyl group = 4 H\n    *   -CH2- : 2 H\n    *   -CH= : 1 H\n    *   =C(CH3)2 : 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   Total H atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 H\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Count the bonds:**\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds. Number of C=C bonds = 2.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** The molecule is acyclic with 12 carbon atoms. The total number of bonds between carbon atoms (single and double) is 12 - 1 = 11. Since there are 2 double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = 9. Number of C-C bonds = 9.\n    *   **C-H bonds:** Since there are 22 hydrogen atoms and each is bonded to a carbon atom, the number of C-H bonds is 22.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThe formation of one mole of C12H22 from its elements in their standard states is represented by the equation:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy required to convert the reactants into gaseous atoms:\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_at(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H2: 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of elements = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Molecule**\n\nThis is the energy released when the gaseous atoms combine to form one mole of the molecule. It is the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n\nTotal bond energy = 1800 kJ + 600 kJ + 8800 kJ = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when the molecule is formed from its atoms.\n\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of the molecule)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**5. Convert to the Required Units**\n\nThe options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check against the options.\n*   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\nTo be certain, let's use a Python script to perform the calculations.\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_HH = 100         # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC = 200         # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_dbl_C = 300    # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CH = 400         # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular formula is C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Bond counts for C12H22\nnum_CC_bonds = 9\nnum_C_dbl_C_bonds = 2\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\n\n# 1. Calculate enthalpy of atomization of elements for C12H22\n# The reaction is 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)\nenthalpy_atomization_elements = (num_C * enthalpy_atomization_C) + ((num_H / 2) * bond_energy_HH)\n\n# 2. Calculate total bond energy of the molecule\ntotal_bond_energy_molecule = (num_CC_bonds * bond_energy_CC) + \\\n                             (num_C_dbl_C_bonds * bond_energy_C_dbl_C) + \\\n                             (num_CH_bonds * bond_energy_CH)\n\n# 3. Calculate enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\ndelta_H_f_mol = enthalpy_atomization_elements - total_bond_energy_molecule\n\n# 4. Convert to kJ/g\nmolar_mass_C12H22 = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)  # g/mol\ndelta_H_f_gram = delta_H_f_mol / molar_mass_C12H22\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {delta_H_f_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {delta_H_f_gram}\")\n```\n> Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\n> Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n\nThe calculated result is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<B>>>",
