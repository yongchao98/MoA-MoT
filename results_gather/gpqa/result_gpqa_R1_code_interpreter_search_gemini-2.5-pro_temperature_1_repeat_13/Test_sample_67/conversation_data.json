    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:**\n    The particle has a spin 1/2 and its magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in an energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -mu . B_z = -gamma * B * S_z`. Let's assume it's in the spin-up state along the Z-axis, which is the lower energy state if gamma is positive. This state, denoted as `|+z>`, can be represented by the column vector:\n    `|psi(t=0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]]`\n\n2.  **Identify the new Hamiltonian:**\n    At time t=0, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system is:\n    `H = -mu . B_y = -gamma * B * S_y`\n    where `S_y` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\n3.  **Represent the spin operator:**\n    For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operators are related to the Pauli matrices (`sigma`) by `S = (hbar/2) * sigma`.\n    `S_y = (hbar/2) * sigma_y = (hbar/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `S_z = (hbar/2) * sigma_z = (hbar/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    The Hamiltonian becomes:\n    `H = -gamma * B * (hbar/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    Let's define the Larmor frequency, `omega = gamma * B`. The Hamiltonian is then:\n    `H = -(omega * hbar / 2) * sigma_y`\n\n4.  **Determine the time evolution of the state:**\n    The state of the particle at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n    `|psi(t)> = U(t) |psi(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/hbar)` is the time evolution operator.\n    `U(t) = exp(-i * [-(omega * hbar / 2) * sigma_y] * t / hbar)`\n    `U(t) = exp(i * (omega * t / 2) * sigma_y)`\n    We can use the identity `exp(i * a * n . sigma) = cos(a) * I + i * sin(a) * (n . sigma)`, where `n` is a unit vector. Here, `a = omega * t / 2` and `n . sigma = sigma_y`.\n    `U(t) = cos(omega*t/2) * I + i * sin(omega*t/2) * sigma_y`\n    `U(t) = cos(omega*t/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i * sin(omega*t/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(omega*t/2), 0], [0, cos(omega*t/2)]] + [[0, sin(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2), 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(omega*t/2), sin(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2), cos(omega*t/2)]]`\n    Now, we apply this operator to the initial state:\n    `|psi(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [[cos(omega*t/2), sin(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2), cos(omega*t/2)]] * [[1], [0]]`\n    `|psi(t)> = [[cos(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2)]]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment:**\n    The goal is to find the average (expectation value) of `mu_z`, which is `<mu_z(t)>`.\n    `<mu_z(t)> = gamma * <S_z(t)> = gamma * <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>`\n    First, let's find `<S_z(t)>`. The bra vector `<psi(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|psi(t)>`:\n    `<psi(t)| = [cos(omega*t/2), -sin(omega*t/2)]`\n    Now, we compute the full expression:\n    `<S_z(t)> = [cos(omega*t/2), -sin(omega*t/2)] * (hbar/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2)]]`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (hbar/2) * [cos(omega*t/2), -sin(omega*t/2)] * [[cos(omega*t/2)], [sin(omega*t/2)]]`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (hbar/2) * (cos^2(omega*t/2) - sin^2(omega*t/2))`\n    Using the trigonometric double-angle identity `cos(2x) = cos^2(x) - sin^2(x)`, we get:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (hbar/2) * cos(omega*t)`\n\n6.  **Determine the oscillation frequency:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<mu_z(t)> = gamma * <S_z(t)> = gamma * (hbar/2) * cos(omega*t)`\n    This expression describes an oscillation. The oscillating part is `cos(omega*t)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `omega`.\n    From our definition in step 3, `omega = gamma * B`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector precesses around the applied magnetic field (in this case, the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency `omega = gamma * B`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis oscillates at this same frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `gamma * B`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
