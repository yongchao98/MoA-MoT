    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The peak is broad due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) described. We need to find a structure that has protons with the specific environments required to produce these signals.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four proposed saturated structures.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This indicates a single proton (let's call it Hₓ) is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Hₓ is coupled to one adjacent proton (n=1, based on the n+1 rule).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Hₓ is coupled to two adjacent protons (n=2).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Hₓ is coupled to three adjacent protons (n=3).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This indicates a different single proton (let's call it Hᵧ) is also being split by three different sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Hᵧ is coupled to one adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Hᵧ is coupled to two adjacent protons (n=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Hᵧ is coupled to another, different set of two adjacent protons (n=2).\n\nNow, let's examine the structure of each option to see if it matches these NMR requirements. We will focus on the protons attached to the chiral centers (methine, -CH- groups) as they are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\n*   The proton at C3 is coupled to the C2-H (1H), the C3-CH₃ (3H), and the C4-CH₂ (2H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n*   However, there is no proton in the molecule that is coupled to one proton, a group of two protons, and another group of two protons. Thus, there is no **dtt** signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`\nLet's analyze the two methine (-CH-) protons:\n*   **Proton at C4 (H-C4):**\n    *   It is adjacent to the C5-**CH₃** group (3 neighbors → **quartet**).\n    *   It is adjacent to the **H** at C3 (1 neighbor → **doublet**).\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** of its ethyl group (2 neighbors → **triplet**).\n    *   The combined splitting pattern is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n*   **Proton at C3 (H-C3):**\n    *   It is adjacent to the **H** at C4 (1 neighbor → **doublet**).\n    *   It is adjacent to the C2-**CH₂** group (2 neighbors → **triplet**).\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** of its own ethyl group (2 neighbors → **triplet**).\n    *   The combined splitting pattern is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n*   Conclusion: This structure perfectly accounts for both of the complex signals described in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃-CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n*   The proton at C3 is coupled to the C2-H (1H), the C3-ethyl's CH₂ (2H), and the C4-CH₂ (2H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n*   However, there is no proton in the molecule that is coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and a 3H group. Thus, there is no **dtq** signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   The proton at C3 is coupled to the C4-H (1H), the C3-CH₃ (3H), and the C2-CH₂ (2H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n*   Similar to option A, there is no environment that would produce a **dtt** signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure B, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has protons in the correct chemical environments to produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
