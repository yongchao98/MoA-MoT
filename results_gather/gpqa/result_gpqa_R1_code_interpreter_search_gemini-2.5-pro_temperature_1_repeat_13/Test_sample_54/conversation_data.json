    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n        *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** A chemical shift around 2.0-2.2 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n        *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** This indicates that these three protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This signal is highly indicative of an acetate group (CH₃-COO-). All four possible options contain an acetate group, so this is consistent.\n\n    *   **Analyze the remaining signals:** The other signals at 7.0 ppm, 5.5 ppm, and 1.6 ppm must describe the rest of the molecule (the \"propenyl\" or \"butenyl\" part).\n\n2.  **Determine the Number of Protons in the Alkene Chain:**\n    *   Let's sum the integration of the remaining signals: 1H (at 7.0 ppm) + 1H (at 5.5 ppm) + 3H (at 1.6 ppm) = 5 protons.\n    *   This means the alkyl/alkenyl group attached to the acetate oxygen has a total of 5 protons.\n\n3.  **Eliminate Incorrect Structures based on Proton Count:**\n    *   **Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃):** This group has 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 protons. This matches our data.\n    *   **Butenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃):** This group has 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7 protons. This does not match our data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate, not a butenyl acetate. This eliminates options B) Cis-butenyl acetate and D) Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n4.  **Distinguish Between Cis and Trans Isomers:**\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n    *   The key to distinguishing between cis and trans isomers on a double bond is the coupling constant (J-value) between the vinylic protons (the H atoms on the C=C bond).\n    *   The general rules for vinylic coupling constants are:\n        *   **J_trans ≈ 12-18 Hz** (for protons in a trans relationship)\n        *   **J_cis ≈ 6-12 Hz** (for protons in a cis relationship)\n    *   Let's look at the signals corresponding to the vinylic protons: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). These two protons are coupled to each other.\n    *   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   This value (16.0 Hz) falls squarely within the typical range for a trans coupling.\n\n5.  **Final Assignment and Confirmation:**\n    *   The structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Let's confirm that all signals match this structure.\n        *   **Structure:** CH₃(a)-COO-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d) (with H(b) and H(c) in a trans configuration).\n        *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** Corresponds to the acetate methyl protons (a).\n        *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** Corresponds to the terminal methyl protons (d), which are split into a doublet by the adjacent vinylic proton (c).\n        *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** Corresponds to the vinylic proton (c). It is split into a quartet by the three methyl protons (d) and further split into a doublet by the trans vinylic proton (b), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** Corresponds to the vinylic proton (b), which is attached to the electronegative oxygen atom, making it the most deshielded (highest ppm). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinylic proton (c) with a large trans coupling constant of 16.0 Hz.\n\nAll parts of the 1H NMR spectrum are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
