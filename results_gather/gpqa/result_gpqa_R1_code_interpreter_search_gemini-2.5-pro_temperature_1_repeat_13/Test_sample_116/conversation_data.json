    "An organic moiety shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from the presence of a chiral center or from specific structural constraints that lead to axial or planar chirality. A molecule is achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl compound. In biphenyls, if the four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are occupied by bulky groups, free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted by bulky nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). This steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar, locking the molecule in a twisted conformation.\n    *   To be chiral, the molecule must not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Each ring is asymmetrically substituted (a -COOCH3 group at one ortho position and a -NO2 group at the other). This lack of symmetry in the substitution pattern of the rings ensures that the molecule as a whole is chiral. It is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism due to atropisomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This molecule is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   The central carbon atom (C2, the one attached to the -OH group) is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is a chiral center (or stereocenter). The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is (C6H5)2CO, which is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The central carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and is bonded to only three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl groups), so it cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole possesses a C2 axis of rotation passing through the C=O bond. It also possesses a plane of symmetry that includes this axis. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Since it is achiral, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself), which makes it achiral. This molecule also possesses a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   Since it is achiral, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not. Thus, the correct choice includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
