    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition:**\n    The problem asks about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to the final state $|n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$ (the 1s or ground state). This transition involves a change in the principal quantum number $\\Delta n = 1 - 3 = -2$ and no change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$.\n\n2.  **Recall Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    Electric dipole transitions are the most common type of radiative transitions in atoms. The selection rules for an E1 transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer.\n\n3.  **Check for a Single-Step Transition:**\n    A direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ would have $\\Delta l = 0$. This violates the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. Therefore, a single-photon electric dipole transition is forbidden.\n\n4.  **Consider a Two-Step Transition (Cascade):**\n    The problem states that the decay occurs via *two* dipole transitions. This implies a cascade process through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    The process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{photon 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{photon 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    We must apply the E1 selection rules to both steps of the cascade.\n\n    *   **Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Energy conservation: For a decay (photon emission), the energy must decrease. The energy of a state is $E_n \\propto -1/n^2$. So, the intermediate state must have lower energy than the initial state ($E_{n'} < E_3$), which means $n' < 3$.\n        *   Also, the intermediate state must be able to decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$, so its energy must be higher than the ground state ($E_{n'} > E_1$), which means $n' > 1$.\n        *   Combining these, the only possible value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule: $l' = l \\pm 1 = 0 \\pm 1 = 1$. So, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule: $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0 + (0, \\pm 1)$. So, the possible values for the magnetic quantum number are $m' = -1, 0, 1$.\n        *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are the three states of the 2p subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Step 2: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   Let's verify that this second transition is allowed for all possible intermediate states.\n        *   Initial state: $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. Final state: $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible values of $m'$ (i.e., for $m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n        *   So, all three states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are valid intermediate states.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. Since there are three possible routes (via $m'=-1$, $m'=0$, or $m'=1$), we need to find the relative probability of each path. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first step of the decay.\n\n    The probability of a transition from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\vec{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d}=-e\\vec{r}$ is the electric dipole operator.\n\n    We are interested in the relative probabilities of the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   The three final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate in the absence of external fields.\n    *   Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state and the isotropy of space (no external fields), there is no reason for the atom to prefer decaying to one $m'$ state over another.\n    *   More formally, using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, one can show that the transition matrix elements for the transitions $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$ have a magnitude that is independent of $m'$. This means the transition rates to each of the three $m'$ states are equal.\n\n    Let $P$ be the transition rate to one specific state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$. Then the rates to $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ are also $P$. The total transition rate from the 3s state to the 2p subshell is $P_{total} = P + P + P = 3P$.\n\n    The probability (or branching ratio) for the decay to proceed through the specific intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is the ratio of the rate for that path to the total rate:\n    $$ \\text{Prob(via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{P}{P_{total}} = \\frac{P}{3P} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n    Similarly, the probability for the decay to proceed via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is $1/3$, and via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is also $1/3$.\n\n7.  **Match with the Given Options:**\n    Let's examine the options provided:\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n\n    Our calculation shows that the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is a valid cascade, and the probability of this specific path being taken is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option A perfectly. The other options list valid routes but with incorrect probabilities.\n\n<<<A>>>"
