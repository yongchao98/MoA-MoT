    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   The substituents are an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The numbering indicates that if the acetyl group is at position 1, the bromo group is at position 3, and the nitro group is at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A meta-director and strongly deactivating.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** An ortho,para-director and weakly deactivating.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A meta-director and strongly deactivating.\n\n**3. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the order of reactions is crucial. We must consider the directing effects at each step.\n\nA critical constraint is the Friedel-Crafts acylation (adding the -COCH3 group). This reaction does not work on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a -NO2 group. Therefore, the acylation step must be performed before nitration, or on a ring that is not strongly deactivated.\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on this understanding.\n\n**Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Reduction gives aniline.\n*   iii) Diazotization gives a diazonium salt.\n*   iv) Deamination (reaction with H3PO2) removes the diazonium group, regenerating benzene. Steps i-iv are a long and pointless synthesis of benzene from benzene.\n*   Even if we ignore the first four steps and start from step v) with benzene -> bromobenzene.\n*   vi) Acylation of bromobenzene. The -Br group is an o,p-director, so this would yield a mixture of 2-bromoacetophenone and 4-bromoacetophenone, not the desired 3-bromo isomer.\n*   Therefore, Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3. This is Friedel-Crafts acylation. The amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and preventing the acylation reaction. The sequence is chemically flawed.\n*   Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene -> Bromobenzene.\n*   ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4. The -Br group is an o,p-director, yielding a mixture of 2-bromonitrobenzene and 4-bromonitrobenzene. Neither has the required meta relationship.\n*   iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 on bromonitrobenzene. The ring is deactivated by both a bromo and a nitro group. Friedel-Crafts acylation under these conditions is not feasible.\n*   Therefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nLet's analyze the first three steps, which represent a complete synthesis pathway.\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The resulting acetyl group (-COCH3) is a meta-director.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3. This step is correct.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** At this stage, the ring has an acetyl group at C1 (meta-director, strong deactivator) and a bromo group at C3 (o,p-director, weak deactivator).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   The directing effects are conflicting. However, the position meta to the strongly deactivating group (C5) is the least deactivated position on the ring and is the major site of substitution. Thus, nitration occurs at C5 to yield the desired product.\n\nThis three-step sequence (i, ii, iii) successfully produces the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically nonsensical as they would modify the already-formed product into something else. In the context of a multiple-choice question, it's common for incorrect options to be entirely wrong, while the correct option contains the right core sequence, even with extraneous or erroneous later steps. The initial sequence in Option D is the only chemically viable route among the choices provided to synthesize the target compound with high yield and correct regiochemistry.\n\n<<<D>>>"
