    "*   **Analysis of the Reaction**\n    The reagents used are sodium nitrite (NaNO2), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and water (H2O). The combination of NaNO2 and HCl generates nitrous acid (HONO) *in situ*.\n    The overall transformation is the conversion of a starting material into a diketone. Specifically, the products are α-diketones (or 1,2-diones), where two carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbon atoms.\n    The reaction of a ketone containing an α-methylene group (-CH2-) with nitrous acid is a well-known method for synthesizing α-diketones. The reaction proceeds through the following general steps:\n    1.  Acid-catalyzed enolization of the ketone to form an enol.\n    2.  The enol attacks the nitrosonium ion (NO+), which is formed from nitrous acid in the acidic medium. This step is called nitrosation and occurs at the α-carbon.\n    3.  This forms an α-nitroso ketone, which is in equilibrium with its tautomer, an α-oximino ketone (an oxime).\n    4.  Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the oxime group yields the second carbonyl group, resulting in the final α-diketone product.\n    The net reaction is the oxidation of a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl group into a new carbonyl group:\n    R-C(=O)-CH₂-R' → R-C(=O)-C(=O)-R'\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction A**\n    *   **Product:** 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione.\n    *   This is an α-diketone with carbonyl groups at positions C1 and C2 of a cyclohexane ring, and an isopropyl group at C4.\n    *   Based on the reaction mechanism described above, the starting material (A) must be a ketone that has a carbonyl group at either C1 or C2, and a methylene (-CH₂) group at the adjacent position.\n    *   Let's consider **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one** as the starting material A.\n        *   The carbonyl group is at C1.\n        *   The α-positions are C2 and C6. Both are methylene groups.\n        *   The reaction with NaNO₂/HCl will introduce a carbonyl group at one of these α-positions (e.g., C2).\n        *   This will yield 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione, which is the desired product.\n    *   Let's consider the other option for A given in the choices: **4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol**. This is a methoxy-alcohol, not a ketone. The given reagents are not standard for converting this compound into a diketone. Therefore, 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one is the correct starting material for A.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction B**\n    *   **Product:** 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.\n    *   This is a linear α-diketone with carbonyl groups at positions C2 and C3, and a methyl group at C5. The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   Following the same logic, the starting material (B) must be a ketone with a carbonyl group at C2 or C3, and an adjacent methylene group.\n    *   Let's consider **5-methylhexan-2-one** as the starting material B.\n        *   Its structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₃.\n        *   The carbonyl group is at C2.\n        *   The α-positions are C1 (a methyl group, -CH₃) and C3 (a methylene group, -CH₂).\n        *   The nitrosation reaction preferentially occurs at the more substituted α-carbon that can form an enol, which is the methylene group at C3.\n        *   Oxidation of the C3 methylene group will result in a carbonyl group at C3.\n        *   This yields 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione, the desired product.\n    *   Let's consider the other option for B given in the choices: **5-methylhexane-2,3-diol**. This is a diol. While diols can be oxidized to diketones, NaNO₂/HCl is not the standard reagent for this oxidation. This reaction would require a stronger oxidizing agent. Therefore, 5-methylhexan-2-one is the correct starting material for B.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    *   Starting material A is **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n    *   Starting material B is **5-methylhexan-2-one**.\n    *   This combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
