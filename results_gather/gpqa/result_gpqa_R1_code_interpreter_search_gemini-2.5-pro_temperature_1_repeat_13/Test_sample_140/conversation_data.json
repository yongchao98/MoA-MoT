    "This problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an isotopically labeled aryl halide with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This set of reagents is a classic condition for the reaction to proceed via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reagents:**\n    *   Reactant: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where a bromine atom is at position 1 and a deuterium atom (d), an isotope of hydrogen, is at position 2. A normal hydrogen atom (H) is at position 6.\n    *   Reagents: Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). The amide ion (NH2-) is a very strong base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction proceeds via a two-step elimination-addition mechanism.\n    *   **Step 1 (Elimination):** The strong base, NH2-, abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br-) to form a highly reactive intermediate called benzyne, which contains a formal triple bond within the benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:**\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1: C2 and C6.\n    *   Position C2 has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   Position C6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The amide base can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2.\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6.** The base removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of Br- from C1 results in a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is retained in this intermediate.\n        `1-bromo-2-d-benzene --(-HBr)--> 3-d-benzyne` (The deuterium is at position 3 relative to the new triple bond).\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2.** The base removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of Br- from C1 results in a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. This benzyne intermediate has no deuterium.\n        `1-bromo-2-d-benzene --(-DBr)--> benzyne` (non-deuterated).\n    *   **Kinetic Isotope Effect:** The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. Therefore, Pathway A (abstraction of H) is kinetically favored and will be the major pathway. However, Pathway B (abstraction of D) is still possible and will occur to a lesser extent. Consequently, **two different benzyne intermediates** will be formed in the reaction mixture.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Addition Step for Each Intermediate:**\n    *   **Step 2 (Addition):** The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2-), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-d-benzyne):**\n        *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2- attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation of this carbanion yields **2-deuterioaniline** (the NH2 group is at C1 and the D is at C2, which are ortho to each other).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2- attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation of this carbanion yields **3-deuterioaniline** (the NH2 group is at C6 and the D is at C2; relative to the NH2 group, the D is in the meta position).\n        *   So, Pathway A produces two distinct deuterated products.\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate B (non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack by NH2- at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, will lead to the same single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   So, Pathway B produces one non-deuterated product.\n\n5.  **Count the Total Number of Possible Products:**\n    *   Combining the products from both possible pathways, we get a mixture of three different organic molecules:\n        1.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n        2.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        3.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
