    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. The general formula is YF_n.\n    The formula for mass fraction is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    Using the molar mass of F ≈ 19.00 g/mol:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    Rearranging for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    M(Y) = (n * 19.00 / 0.3196) - (n * 19.00)\n    M(Y) = 59.45n - 19.00n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n\n    We need to find an element Y and an integer n (the number of fluorine atoms) that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca, Ar)\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br, Se)\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Sb, Antimony, M=121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no common element)\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Hg, Au)\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (very close to Pu-242, Am-243)\n\n    Let's check the most promising candidates by calculating the theoretical mass fraction:\n    *   For Y=Sb (Antimony) and n=3, A2 = SbF3.\n        M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 0.3188 (31.88%). This is very close to 31.96%.\n    *   For Y=Pu (Plutonium, isotope 242) and n=6, A2 = PuF6.\n        M(PuF6) = 242.06 + 6 * 19.00 = 356.06 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (6 * 19.00) / 356.06 = 0.3201 (32.01%). Also very close.\n\n    Both Sb and Pu are strong candidates for element Y.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues for A1 and A3.**\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and F2. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of Y (YF_m -> YF_n + F2, where m > n).\n    *   If Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. Then A1 must be SbF5. However, SbF5 is a colorless liquid and decomposes at much higher temperatures (>400 °C). This is a major contradiction.\n    *   If Y=Pu, A2=PuF6. Then A1 must be a higher fluoride like PuF8. Such a compound is not known to be stable, but for a problem, its existence might be assumed. Being extremely unstable, decomposition at 293 K would be plausible. Its color is unknown, so \"bright-red\" cannot be immediately refuted. PuF6 itself is reddish-brown.\n    *   Both SbF5 and PuF6 are extremely strong oxidizing agents and would react with Xenon, fitting the description for A1 and A3.\n\n    There are inconsistencies in both scenarios, which is common in complex chemistry problems. However, we have enough information to proceed by analyzing the second part of the problem concerning A4.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    The key information is:\n    *   A5 is obtained by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4.\n    *   The reaction is: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\n    *   The molecular weight of A4 falls into one of the given ranges.\n\n    The reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` where Y is a metallic or metalloid element suggests a redox reaction where A4 is an oxidizing agent. Since the problem's context is fluorine chemistry, A4 is likely a fluoride. A4 must also form a colorless solution.\n\n    Let's consider the xenon fluorides as potential candidates for A4, as they are strong fluorinating oxidizers and are colorless.\n    *   **XeF2**: Molar mass = 131.29 + 2 * 19.00 = 169.29 g/mol.\n    *   **XeF4**: Molar mass = 131.29 + 4 * 19.00 = 207.29 g/mol.\n    *   **XeF6**: Molar mass = 131.29 + 6 * 19.00 = 245.29 g/mol.\n\n    Now, let's compare these molecular weights with the given ranges:\n    *   A) 220-240\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 110-130\n    *   D) 160-180\n\n    Only XeF2 (169.3 g/mol) fits perfectly into one of the ranges: **D) 160-180**. XeF4 and XeF6 do not fit into any of the ranges. This provides very strong evidence that **A4 is XeF2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Rest of the Clues with A4 = XeF2.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Let's see if the reaction `Y + XeF2 -> A5` (1:1) is chemically sound.\n        A plausible reaction is `Y + XeF2 -> YF2 + Xe`. This is a 1:1 reaction between Y and A4. Substance A5 would be YF2.\n    *   **A5 Decomposition:** The problem states A5 decomposes in water into two substances.\n        *   If Y=Sb, A5=SbF2. Antimony(II) fluoride would hydrolyze in water, for example: `SbF2 + H2O -> SbO + 2HF`. This produces two substances. This is consistent.\n        *   If Y=Pu, A5=PuF2. Plutonium(II) fluoride would also hydrolyze. This is also consistent.\n    *   **Conclusion on A4:** The identification of A4 as XeF2 is consistent with the reaction chemistry regardless of whether Y is Sb or Pu, and it is the only plausible candidate whose molecular weight fits the given options.\n\n5.  **Final Answer.**\n    The substance A4 is identified as Xenon difluoride (XeF2). Its molecular weight is approximately 169.3 g/mol. This value falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>"
