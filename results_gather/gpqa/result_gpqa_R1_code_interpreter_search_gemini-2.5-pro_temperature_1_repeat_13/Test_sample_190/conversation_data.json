    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), and an alkene (the isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-21). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the primary alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    \n    R-CH₂OH + NaH → R-CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    \n    The resulting alkoxide is a good nucleophile. It then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis, which is an S_N2 reaction. The alkoxide attacks the benzylic carbon, displacing the bromide ion. This process \"protects\" the alcohol group as a benzyl ether. The ketone and alkene groups are unreactive under these conditions.\n    \n    R-CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph (a benzyl ether, ROBn) + NaBr\n    \n*   **Product 1:** The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard formation of a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The ketone's carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the hydrazide in a condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water. The acid catalyst activates the carbonyl group for nucleophilic attack.\n    \n    R₂C=O + H₂N-NHTs --(H⁺)--> R₂C=N-NHTs + H₂O\n    \n*   **Product 2:** The product is the tosylhydrazone of product 1: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene. The mechanism involves the use of at least two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi):\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the α-proton on the less sterically hindered carbon adjacent to the C=N bond. In this case, the original ketone was at C1. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. C6 is less substituted (it has two protons), so deprotonation occurs there.\n    3.  The resulting dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (p-toluenesulfinate anion, Ts⁻), to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond is formed between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The final step is quenching the reaction with a mild proton source, aqueous ammonium chloride, which protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone at C1 has been converted to a C=C double bond between C1 and C6. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This powerful reducing condition has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds in the molecule will be reduced to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be saturated with hydrogen.\n        - The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n        - The isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] becomes an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl protecting group is cleaved under these conditions. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, and the oxygen is replaced with a hydrogen atom, regenerating the primary alcohol. The benzyl group becomes toluene.\n        - The benzyloxymethyl group [-CH₂OBn] becomes a hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂OH].\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Their relative 1,3-positions on the ring are maintained throughout the synthesis. The systematic name for this structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's compare our derived final product with the given options:\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. The benzyl ether is cleaved, and there is no butyl group or alcohol on the ring.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This is a benzyl ether, which would have been cleaved in the final step.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This structure still contains the tosylhydrazone moiety, which was eliminated in the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This structure matches the final product obtained after hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of product 3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
