    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Core Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring) and contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. A benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum shows the presence of:\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X), meaning a halogen atom is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Goal:** Identify the correct 1H NMR spectrum from the four options provided.\n\n**2. Propose a Plausible Chemical Structure**\n\n*   Based on the information, we have a benzene ring with two substituents: a halogen (-X) and another group containing two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n*   The most straightforward and common chemical group that fits the \"2 carbons and a carbonyl\" description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n*   Therefore, the most likely structure is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n*   The total number of protons is 4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group, for a total of 7 protons.\n\n**3. Analyze the Effect of Substitution Pattern on the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4).\n\n*   ***Ortho* and *Meta* Isomers:** In these arrangements, all four protons on the aromatic ring are in different chemical environments. This would lead to a complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region (typically four separate multiplets).\n*   ***Para* Isomer (1,4-disubstituted):** This isomer has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other. This results in a much simpler spectrum in the aromatic region, typically consisting of two distinct doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the *para*-Haloacetophenone**\n\nLet's assume the structure is the *para* isomer (4-haloacetophenone) and predict its spectrum:\n\n*   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** These three protons are on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group. They have no neighboring protons to couple with.\n    *   **Signal:** A singlet (s).\n    *   **Integration:** 3H.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm for a methyl ketone.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are two sets of equivalent protons.\n    *   **Signal:** Two doublets (d).\n    *   **Integration:** Each doublet will integrate to 2H.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Both the acetyl group (-COCH₃) and the halogen (-X) are electron-withdrawing groups, which de-shield the aromatic protons, shifting them downfield (to a higher ppm value) compared to benzene (7.26 ppm). The carbonyl group has a stronger de-shielding effect on its adjacent (ortho) protons. Therefore, we expect one doublet to be further downfield than the other. A reasonable range would be ~7.5-8.0 ppm.\n\n**5. Compare the Predicted Spectrum with the Given Options**\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum:** A singlet (3H) around 2.3 ppm, and two doublets (2H each) between 7.5 and 8.0 ppm.\n\nNow let's examine the options:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: A 3-proton singlet at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: Two 2-proton doublets in the downfield aromatic region. This perfectly matches the pattern for a *para*-substituted benzene ring with two different electron-withdrawing groups. The signal at 7.8 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the more strongly de-shielding carbonyl group, and the signal at 7.6 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the halogen.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts of 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are too low for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would imply a different structure, like 4-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), which also has 8 carbons. However, in this structure, the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl is insulated from the ring by a -CH₂- group. The aromatic protons would appear at a much lower chemical shift (typically ~7.2-7.4 ppm), not at 7.6 and 7.8 ppm. Therefore, this data is internally inconsistent.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This pattern does not match any plausible structure and contains unusual signals (e.g., a 2H singlet at 1.3 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only option that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a compound fitting the given criteria is A. The compound is a 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>"
