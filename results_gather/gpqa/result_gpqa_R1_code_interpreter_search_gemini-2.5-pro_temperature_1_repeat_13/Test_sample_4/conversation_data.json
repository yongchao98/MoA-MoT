    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$, which is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$. The components are given in terms of the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$):\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector:**\n    The problem specifies an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector in 3D can be represented in spherical coordinates as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$. For a vector in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ is 0.\n    So, the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos(0), \\sin\\theta \\sin(0), \\cos\\theta) = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n    Here, $\\theta$ is the angle the vector $\\vec{n}$ makes with the positive z-axis.\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y (0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n    Substituting the matrix representations:\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta$\n    Combine the matrices:\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. Let the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalue equation is $P_{\\vec{n}}|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve the Equation System:**\n    We can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's work with the first equation:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    Now, we find the ratio $b/a$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    To simplify this expression, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Substituting these into the ratio:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    So, we have the relationship $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The unnormalized eigenvector can be written as:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    To simplify the form and make normalization easier, we can multiply the vector by $\\cos(\\theta/2)$. This is valid since the eigenvector is defined up to a constant multiplicative factor.\n    $|\\psi\\rangle \\propto \\cos(\\theta/2) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\cos(\\theta/2)\\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, we need to normalize this vector. The normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$. The squared norm is:\n    $(\\cos(\\theta/2))^* \\cos(\\theta/2) + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^* \\sin(\\theta/2) = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    The norm is $\\sqrt{1} = 1$. The vector is already normalized.\n\n    Thus, the normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The elements of the eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Comparing our result with the given options:\n    A) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - This matches our result.\n    B) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$ - Incorrect form and includes $\\phi$.\n    C) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect form, incorrect coefficients, and has units of $\\hbar$.\n    D) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Incorrect for the same reasons as C.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
