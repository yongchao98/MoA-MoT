    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and its States:**\n    The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n    Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n    The total number of possible states (configurations) for the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^3 = 8.\n\n2.  **Define the Energy of the System:**\n    The energy for any given state is defined by the formula:\n    E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\n3.  **Define the Partition Function:**\n    The partition function, Z, is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\n    Z = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy for Each State:**\n    We need to list all 8 possible states and calculate the energy for each one. A systematic way to do this is to group states by the number of positive spins.\n\n    *   **State 1: All spins up (+1, +1, +1)**\n        S1=1, S2=1, S3=1\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n    *   **State 2: Two spins up, one spin down**\n        There are three such configurations:\n        a) (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        b) (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        c) (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        All three states have the same energy, E = J.\n\n    *   **State 3: One spin up, two spins down**\n        There are three such configurations:\n        a) (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        b) (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        c) (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        All three states have the same energy, E = J.\n\n    *   **State 4: All spins down (-1, -1, -1)**\n        S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n        E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n5.  **Summarize Energy Levels and Degeneracies:**\n    From the calculations above, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels for this system.\n    *   **Energy Level 1 (E1):** E1 = -3J\n        This energy level corresponds to the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n        The degeneracy (number of states with this energy) is g1 = 2.\n    *   **Energy Level 2 (E2):** E2 = J\n        This energy level corresponds to all other six states (the three states with two spins up and the three states with one spin up).\n        The degeneracy is g2 = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Partition Function Z:**\n    The partition function can now be calculated by summing the contributions from each energy level, weighted by their degeneracy.\n    Z = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\n    Z = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (J))\n    Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated expression for the partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ).\n    Let's compare this with the given choices:\n    A) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n    B) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n    C) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n    D) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\n    Our result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
