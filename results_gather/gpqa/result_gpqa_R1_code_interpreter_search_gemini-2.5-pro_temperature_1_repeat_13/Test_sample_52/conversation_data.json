    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This is a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   **FTIR Data:** An absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-) is present.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are *two signals* for the aromatic protons. In a di-substituted benzene ring, this pattern strongly suggests a **1,4- (para) substitution**. A para-substituted ring with two different substituents gives two signals (often two doublets) for the four aromatic protons due to symmetry. This gives us a `p-disubstituted C6H4` core.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (-CH=CH-):** There are *two signals* for vinyl protons. This indicates a double bond with a hydrogen on each carbon.\n        *   Signal 1: A **doublet**. This means the corresponding proton is adjacent to (coupled with) only one other proton.\n        *   Signal 2: A **doublet of quartets (dq)**. The \"doublet\" part arises from coupling to one proton. The \"quartet\" part arises from coupling to three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   This splitting pattern (d + dq) is a classic fingerprint for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to another group (in this case, the aromatic ring).\n            *   Let's verify: In `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`, proton H(a) is split only by H(b), giving a doublet. Proton H(b) is split by H(a) (giving a doublet) and by the adjacent -CH3 group (giving a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This perfectly matches the data.\n            *   So, one substituent is a propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are *two signals* for methyl groups.\n        *   Signal 1: We have already identified one methyl group as part of the propenyl substituent (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   Signal 2: The second methyl group must be part of the other substituent, which we know is an ester. The simplest ester group containing a methyl group is a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)**. The protons of this methyl group would appear as a singlet, as they have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** The spectrum shows **no signals** for -CH2- groups. This is a crucial piece of information. Our proposed substituents, propenyl (-CH=CH-CH3) and methyl ester (-COOCH3), do not contain any -CH2- groups, which is consistent with the data.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure and Determine the Formula**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can assemble the molecule:\n*   **Core:** A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring (`C6H4`).\n*   **Substituent 1:** A propenyl group (`-C3H5`).\n*   **Substituent 2:** A methyl ester group (`-COOCH3`).\n\nThe most likely structure is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\nNow, let's count the atoms to find the chemical formula:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (in the benzene ring) + 3 (in the propenyl group) + 1 (in the carbonyl C=O) + 1 (in the methoxy -OCH3) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (on the benzene ring) + 5 (in the propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3) + 3 (in the methoxy -OCH3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (in the ester group, -COO-) = **2 oxygens**.\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option A. Let's briefly consider why the other options are incorrect:\n*   **C11H14O2:** Has two more hydrogens. This would imply the absence of the C=C double bond in the propenyl group (i.e., it would be a propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3). This would eliminate the vinyl-H signals and introduce -CH2- signals, both of which contradict the data.\n*   **C12H14O2:** Has one more carbon and two more hydrogens. This could correspond to a structure like ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. However, the ethyl group (-CH2CH3) contains a -CH2- group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n*   **C12H12O2:** Has one more carbon but the same number of hydrogens. This would require an additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., another double bond or ring), which is difficult to reconcile with the provided NMR data without violating the \"no -CH2-\" rule or the specific splitting patterns.\n\nThe evidence strongly and consistently points to the formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
