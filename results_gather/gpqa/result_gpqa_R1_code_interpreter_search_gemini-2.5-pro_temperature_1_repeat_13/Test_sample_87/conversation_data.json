    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on an experimental scenario.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the experiment:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (a viral antigen).\n    *   **Route:** Oral gavage, which targets the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n    *   **Location:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine, crucial for initiating mucosal immunity.\n    *   **Cells of Interest:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. In a secondary lymphoid organ, following antigen exposure, rapid proliferation of lymphocytes occurs in structures called germinal centers. This is characteristic of an adaptive immune response.\n    *   **Key Observation:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" from these cells shows \"high variability\". The variable region of an antibody (or B-cell receptor) is what binds to the antigen.\n\n2.  **Analyze the options in the context of the observation:**\n\n    *   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that generates the initial, vast diversity of B-cell receptors (antibodies) and T-cell receptors. However, it occurs in *developing* lymphocytes (B-cells in the bone marrow, T-cells in the thymus) *before* they encounter an antigen. The scenario describes a response in a *secondary* lymphoid organ to an antigen that has already been introduced. VDJ recombination has already happened in these cells before they migrated to the Peyer's patch.\n\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which alters the antibody's function and location (e.g., IgA is important for mucosal immunity). It does *not* alter the *variable* region, so it does not account for the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene.\n\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs specifically in activated B-cells that are proliferating within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the genes encoding the *variable* regions of the antibody heavy and light chains. This creates a pool of B-cells with slightly different antigen-binding sites. Those B-cells whose mutations lead to higher affinity for the antigen are preferentially selected to survive and proliferate (a process called affinity maturation). This directly explains the \"high variability\" found in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of the \"proliferating cell population\".\n\n    *   **D) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, a cascade of plasma proteins that helps clear pathogens. It does not involve genetic changes in lymphocytes and is unrelated to the variability of antibody genes.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and conclude:** The experiment describes a classic germinal center reaction in a mucosal lymphoid tissue (Peyer's patch) in response to a viral antigen. The key finding of high variability specifically in the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating B-cells is the defining characteristic of somatic hypermutation, which is the mechanism for affinity maturation of the antibody response.\n\n<<<C>>>"
