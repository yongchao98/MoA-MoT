    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the factors influencing product distribution.**\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring (C6H5-X). The substituent 'X' on the ring determines where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will attack. This is known as the directing effect. The key factors are:\n1.  **Directing Effect:** Substituents are classified as either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*.\n2.  **Steric Hindrance:** Bulky substituents can block the *ortho* positions, favoring substitution at the less hindered *para* position.\n3.  **Electronic Effects:** The interplay of inductive and resonance effects influences the reactivity of the ortho, meta, and para positions.\n\nThe question asks for the order of increasing weight fraction of the *para*-isomer. The weight fraction is directly proportional to the mole fraction (percentage) of the para-isomer formed.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents for each substance.**\n\n*   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is electron-donating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. It is electron-withdrawing and a **meta-director**.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is deactivating but **ortho, para-directing**.\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a nitro group. It is strongly electron-withdrawing and a **meta-director**.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is electron-donating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It is electron-withdrawing and a **meta-director**.\n\n**Step 3: Separate substances into two groups based on their directing effects.**\n\n*   **Group 1 (low para-yield):** The *meta*-directors will produce the *meta*-isomer as the major product, with only trace amounts of the *ortho* and *para* isomers.\n    *   4) Nitrobenzene (-NO2)\n    *   6) Benzoic acid (-COOH)\n    *   2) Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5)\n*   **Group 2 (high para-yield):** The *ortho, para*-directors will produce a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers as the major products.\n    *   1) Toluene (-CH3)\n    *   5) Ethylbenzene (-C2H5)\n    *   3) Chlorobenzene (-Cl)\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances within Group 1 (meta-directors).**\nFor these substances, the para-yield is extremely low. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group will favor the meta position more strongly, leading to an even smaller percentage of para-isomer.\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 (strongest) > -COOH (strong) > -COOC2H5 (moderate)\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\n\n**Step 5: Order the substances within Group 2 (ortho, para-directors).**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the factors that favor para-substitution over ortho-substitution.\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference for the ortho/para ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders attack at the adjacent *ortho* positions, thus increasing the proportion of the product formed by attack at the *para* position. So, the para-yield for ethylbenzene will be higher than for toluene.\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** Halogens are a special case. Although the -Cl group is deactivating overall, it is an ortho, para-director. Its high electronegativity exerts a strong negative inductive effect (-I), which deactivates all positions but falls off with distance. This effect is strongest at the ortho positions and weaker at the para position. This electronic effect makes the para position significantly more favorable for attack than the ortho positions, leading to a very high para/ortho ratio. The para-selectivity for halogens is typically higher than for alkyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene will have the highest percentage of para-isomer in this group.\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for Group 2 is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\n\n**Step 6: Combine the ordered groups.**\nThe substances in Group 1 have a much lower para-yield than those in Group 2. By combining the orders from Step 4 and Step 5, we get the final sequence.\n(4 < 6 < 2) << (1 < 5 < 3)\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
