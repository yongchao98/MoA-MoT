    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br₂).**\nThis is the α-halogenation of a ketone. In the presence of an acid or base catalyst (often implicitly assumed or present as an impurity), one of the α-hydrogens of cyclohexanone is substituted by a bromine atom. The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Product 1: 2-Bromocyclohexanone**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).**\nThis step involves an α-halo ketone and a strong base (NaOH) with heating. While E2 elimination is a possibility, the reaction conditions are classic for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This rearrangement is common for α-halo ketones that have at least one α'-hydrogen (a hydrogen on the other side of the carbonyl group).\n1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) acts as a base and removes a proton from the α'-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n2.  The enolate anion then performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a strained bicyclic intermediate: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one.\n3.  The hydroxide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of the bicyclic ketone. This forms a tetrahedral intermediate.\n4.  To relieve the high strain of the three-membered ring, the intermediate collapses. The C1-C6 bond breaks, forming a more stable carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n5.  Protonation of the resulting carboxylate anion (during the reaction or work-up) yields a carboxylic acid. The six-membered ring has contracted to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**\n\nThe reason we favor the Favorskii rearrangement over a simple elimination reaction (which would form cyclohex-2-en-1-one) is the nature of the next step.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.**\nThis is a standard and highly efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). The thionyl chloride reacts with the carboxylic acid, and pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**\nIf Product 2 had been cyclohex-2-en-1-one, its reaction with SOCl₂ would not be a standard, predictable textbook reaction. The fact that this step works cleanly strongly supports the formation of a carboxylic acid in Step 2.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).**\nThis is a specific reducing agent. It is a bulky and mild hydride donor. Unlike the much more reactive LiAlH₄, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is known for selectively reducing acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reduction at the aldehyde stage without proceeding to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\n**Analysis of the Final Product (Product 4): Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. \"Chemically distinct\" means the hydrogens are in different chemical environments, which would give rise to separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule. There is a plane of symmetry that passes through the C-H and C=O bonds of the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon of the ring, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n\nLet's count the distinct types of hydrogens based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-CHO):** This proton is attached to the carbonyl carbon. Its environment is unique. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the proton on the carbon of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group. Its environment is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, there are two protons. These two protons are diastereotopic because C1 is a chiral center (even though the product is a racemate, this local asymmetry makes the adjacent protons non-equivalent). Therefore, the two protons on C2 are distinct from each other. The same applies to C5. The \"upper\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent, and the \"lower\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent. This gives us two more distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The same is true for C4. This gives us another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n**Total number of chemically distinct hydrogens = 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = 6.**\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
