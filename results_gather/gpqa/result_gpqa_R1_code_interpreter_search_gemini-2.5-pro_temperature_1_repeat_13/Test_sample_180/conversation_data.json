    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Scenario:** The pp-III (proton-proton III) branch of solar fusion stops abruptly.\n    *   **Timing:** This event happened ~8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, and the Sun-Earth travel time is about 8.3 minutes, the effects of this change are just arriving at Earth now.\n    *   **Unaffected Reactions:** All other reactions, including pp-I, pp-II, and the CNO cycle, continue as normal.\n    *   **Question:** What is the approximate ratio of the neutrino flux in the 700-800 keV energy band (Band 1) to the flux in the 800-900 keV energy band (Band 2)?\n        Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)\n\n2.  **Identify Neutrino Sources by Energy Band:**\n    First, let's identify which solar fusion reactions produce neutrinos in these energy ranges under normal conditions. We can refer to the Standard Solar Model (SSM) for neutrino sources and their energies.\n\n    *   **pp neutrinos:** Continuous spectrum up to 420 keV. **Not in either band.**\n    *   **pep neutrinos:** Monoenergetic line at 1440 keV (1.44 MeV). **Not in either band.**\n    *   **⁷Be neutrinos (from pp-II chain):** Monoenergetic lines at 861 keV (90% of the time) and 384 keV (10% of the time). The strong 861 keV line falls squarely **in Band 2 (800-900 keV)**.\n    *   **⁸B neutrinos (from pp-III chain):** Continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV. This spectrum covers both **Band 1 and Band 2**.\n    *   **CNO neutrinos (from CNO cycle):** Continuous spectra from ¹³N and ¹⁵O decay, with endpoints at 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. This spectrum also covers both **Band 1 and Band 2**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Hypothetical Change:**\n    The problem states that the **pp-III branch stops**. The key reaction in the pp-III branch that produces neutrinos is the beta decay of Boron-8 (⁸B).\n    *   ⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νₑ\n    Therefore, the flux of ⁸B neutrinos drops to zero.\n\n4.  **Re-evaluate Fluxes in Each Band (After the Change):**\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   The contribution from ⁸B is now zero.\n        *   The only remaining source of neutrinos in this band is the **CNO cycle**.\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   The contribution from ⁸B is now zero.\n        *   The strong 861 keV line from **⁷Be decay** (part of the pp-II chain, which is unaffected) remains.\n        *   The continuous spectrum from the **CNO cycle** also remains.\n\n5.  **Compare the Magnitudes of the Remaining Fluxes:**\n    Now we need to compare the size of the fluxes. We can use the total flux values predicted by the Standard Solar Model as a guide.\n    *   **Total Flux from ⁷Be decay:** ~ 5.0 x 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm²·s)\n    *   **Total Flux from CNO cycle (¹³N + ¹⁵O):** ~ 5.2 x 10⁸ neutrinos / (cm²·s)\n\n    Notice a crucial point: the total flux from ⁷Be is about **10 times larger** than the total flux from the CNO cycle.\n\n6.  **Formulate and Calculate the Ratio:**\n    *   Flux(Band 1) = Flux from CNO in the 700-800 keV range.\n    *   Flux(Band 2) = Flux from ⁷Be (861 keV line) + Flux from CNO in the 800-900 keV range.\n\n    The ratio is:\n    Ratio = [Flux_CNO(700-800 keV)] / [Flux_⁷Be(861 keV) + Flux_CNO(800-900 keV)]\n\n    Let's analyze the components:\n    *   **Flux_⁷Be(861 keV):** About 90% of the total ⁷Be flux is in this single, narrow line. So, Flux_⁷Be ≈ 0.9 * (5.0 x 10⁹) = 4.5 x 10⁹. This is a massive contribution concentrated entirely in Band 2.\n    *   **Flux_CNO:** The total CNO flux (~5.2 x 10⁸) is spread over a wide energy range (up to 1.73 MeV). The flux in any given 100 keV slice will be only a small fraction of this total. Because the two bands are adjacent and the CNO spectrum is smooth, we can assume Flux_CNO(700-800 keV) ≈ Flux_CNO(800-900 keV).\n\n    Since the ⁷Be flux (~4.5 x 10⁹) is so much larger than the CNO flux in that band (which will be a small fraction of 5.2 x 10⁸), we can approximate the denominator:\n    Denominator = Flux(Band 2) ≈ Flux_⁷Be(861 keV)\n\n    Now the ratio simplifies to:\n    Ratio ≈ Flux_CNO(700-800 keV) / Flux_⁷Be(861 keV)\n\n    Let's make a reasonable estimation. The total ⁷Be flux is ~10 times the total CNO flux.\n    Flux_⁷Be(861 keV) ≈ 0.9 * (Total ⁷Be Flux) ≈ 0.9 * (10 * Total CNO Flux) = 9 * (Total CNO Flux).\n\n    The flux in Band 1 is the fraction of the total CNO flux that falls within the 700-800 keV range. This energy range is near the peak of the CNO spectrum, so it contains a significant, but not overwhelming, portion of the CNO neutrinos. A reasonable estimate for this fraction (`k`) would be around 10% (k≈0.1).\n    Flux_CNO(700-800 keV) ≈ 0.1 * (Total CNO Flux).\n\n    Now, substitute these into the ratio:\n    Ratio ≈ [0.1 * Total CNO Flux] / [9 * Total CNO Flux]\n    Ratio ≈ 0.1 / 9 ≈ 0.0111\n\n    This value is extremely close to 0.01.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The flux in the 800-900 keV band is dominated by the intense and monoenergetic ⁷Be neutrino line, which is about an order of magnitude stronger in total flux than the entire CNO contribution. The flux in the 700-800 keV band consists only of a small fraction of the total CNO flux. The ratio of the two is therefore approximately 0.01.\n\n<<<B>>>"
