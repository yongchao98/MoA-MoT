    "This problem involves the concept of time dilation in special relativity and exponential decay of particles.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Exponential Decay:** The number of particles, `N`, that have not decayed after a time `t` in the laboratory frame is given by the formula:\n    N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)\n    where:\n    *   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n    *   `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particles in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a relativistic particle is longer in the laboratory frame than in its own rest frame (proper lifetime, `τ`). This phenomenon is called time dilation and is described by:\n    τ_lab = γ * τ\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Survival Fraction:** The fraction of particles that survive to reach the detector walls is `N(t_travel) / N₀`. The time it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the wall (a distance `R`) is `t_travel`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n    t_travel ≈ R / c\n    Substituting these into the decay formula, the fraction `F` of particles reaching the wall is:\n    F = exp(-t_travel / τ_lab) = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))\n\n4.  **Analyze the Initial Condition:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁` is 20, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the wall.\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   `F₁ = 1/3`\n    Let's plug these values into our equation:\n    1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20 * τ))\n    The term `(R / (c * τ))` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`.\n    1/3 = exp(-K / 20)\n    To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -K / 20\n    -ln(3) = -K / 20\n    K = 20 * ln(3)\n\n5.  **Solve for the New Condition:** We want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which two-thirds (2/3) of the particles reach the wall.\n    *   `F₂ = 2/3`\n    *   `γ₂ = ?`\n    The equation for this new condition is:\n    2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)\n    Again, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂\n    -ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂\n    ln(3/2) = K / γ₂\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the expression for `K` that we found in step 4:\n    γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n    Using the properties of logarithms, `ln(3/2) = ln(3) - ln(2)`.\n    γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\nNow, let's compute the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the new Lorentz factor using the derived formula\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(3/2)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe calculation yields approximately 54.18. This value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, to the exponential decay of particles.\n\n**1. The Survival Equation**\n\nThe fraction of particles, `F`, that survive after a time `t` in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n`F = N(t) / N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\nwhere:\n*   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n*   `N(t)` is the number of particles remaining after time `t`.\n*   `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory frame.\n\n**2. Time Dilation**\n\nThe mean lifetime of the particles in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to their proper lifetime (`τ`, the lifetime in their own rest frame) by the time dilation formula:\n`τ_lab = γ * τ`\nwhere `γ` is the Lorentz factor (`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`).\n\n**3. Travel Time**\n\nThe particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to travel from the center to the detector wall of radius `R` is:\n`t ≈ R / c`\n\n**4. Combining the Equations**\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `t` and `τ_lab` into the survival equation, we get:\n`F = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\nThis can be rewritten as:\n`F = exp(- (R / (c * τ)) / γ)`\n\nThe term `(R / (c * τ))` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to:\n`F = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n**5. Using the Initial Conditions**\n\nWe are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the survival fraction `F₁ = 1/3`.\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTo solve for the constant `K`, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**6. Solving for the New Lorentz Factor**\n\nNow, we need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the survival fraction `F₂ = 2/3`.\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n`ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n\nSolving for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for `K` we found earlier:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n**7. Calculation**\n\nLet's calculate the value of `γ₂`.\nln(3) ≈ 1.0986\nln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n`γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.185`\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 54. This corresponds to option D. The code execution provided a more precise value of 54.19, which confirms this result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
