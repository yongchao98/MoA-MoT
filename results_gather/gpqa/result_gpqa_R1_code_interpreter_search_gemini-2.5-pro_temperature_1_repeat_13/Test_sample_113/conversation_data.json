    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type of reaction:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a strong nucleophile from NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃.\n        3.  This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final neutral product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion) represents an acidic medium or an acidic workup step, which provides the necessary protons (H⁺). NaHSO₃ is used for forming bisulfite addition products and is not suitable for this step. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type of reaction:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically requiring heat. The presence of H₂O indicates a hydrolysis reaction.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) and water, the nitrile is protonated, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n        *   **HCl** is a strong acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis.\n        *   **CH₃COOH** (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction to a very small extent, it is generally not strong enough to perform this hydrolysis efficiently. Standard procedures call for a strong acid or strong base.\n    *   Therefore, B = HCl is the suitable reagent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, reagent B is HCl.\n    *   Combining these, the correct option is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<A>>>"
