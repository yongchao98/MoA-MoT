    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A \"grounded\" sphere means its electric potential is held constant at zero (V=0).\n\nThe electric field and potential outside the sphere, created by the interaction between the charge `q` and the sphere, can be calculated using the **method of images**. This method replaces the complex charge distribution induced on the sphere's surface with a single, imaginary point charge (an \"image charge\") placed inside the sphere.\n\nThe value and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) becomes zero, satisfying the boundary condition for a grounded sphere.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Position\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin (0,0,0) and the real charge `q` be on the z-axis at `z = d`.\n\nThe image charge, let's call it `q'`, must also lie on the z-axis at some position `z = b` inside the sphere (`b < R`) for symmetry.\n\nThe standard results from the method of images (derived by setting the potential V=0 at the sphere's surface) are:\n\n*   **Position of the image charge (`b`):**\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge (`q'`):**\n    `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nSo, the system of the real charge `q` and the grounded sphere is electrostatically equivalent (for the region outside the sphere) to a system of two point charges: the real charge `q` at `z = d` and the image charge `q'` at `z = b`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at `d`. As the charge `q` is brought closer, it induces charges on the sphere. The work is done against the force exerted by these induced charges.\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system can be calculated as:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of `1/2` is crucial because the induced charge distribution is not fixed; it is created by the presence of `q` itself. The energy is stored in the interaction between `q` and the charges it has induced.\n\nUsing the method of images, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q` (`z = d`).\n\n1.  **Calculate the distance between the real charge and the image charge:**\n    Distance = `d - b`\n    Distance = `d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential `V_induced` at `z=d` due to `q'`:**\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-q * R/d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the total potential energy `U`:**\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated potential energy is `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nLet's compare this with the given options:\n\n*   A) `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   B) `U = -kq^2 d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   C) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n*   D) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur result perfectly matches option A. The energy is negative because the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\n<<<A>>>"
