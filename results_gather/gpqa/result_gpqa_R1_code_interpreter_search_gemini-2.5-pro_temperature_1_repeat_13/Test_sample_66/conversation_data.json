    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1`. The system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state given by `|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    *   `l_1 = 1`: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   `l_2 = 1`: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   `l = 2`: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system.\n    *   `m = -1`: The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum (`L_z`). The eigenvalue of `L_z` is `mħ = -ħ`.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:** A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, `L_{1z}` and `L_{2z}`, is performed.\n\n3.  **Identify the Target Outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of the measurement yielding:\n    *   Eigenvalue of `L_{1z}` as `-ħ`. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number `m_1 = -1`.\n    *   Eigenvalue of `L_{2z}` as `-ħ`. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number `m_2 = -1`.\n    So, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state `|l_1=1, m_1=-1> |l_2=1, m_2=-1>`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta.\n    *   `L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}`\n    *   In terms of their corresponding quantum numbers: `m = m_1 + m_2`.\n\n5.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    *   The initial state is defined by a total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome corresponds to `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n    *   Let's calculate the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers for the target outcome: `m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Result:** The sum of the z-components of the target outcome (`-2`) does not match the z-component of the initial state (`-1`).\n    *   `m ≠ m_1 + m_2`\n    *   `-1 ≠ -2`\n\n7.  **Relate to Quantum Mechanics Formalism (Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients):** The probability of measuring the outcome `(m_1, m_2)` when the system is in the state `|l, m>` is given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: `P(m_1, m_2) = |<l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m>|^2`.\n    *   The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m>` is non-zero only if `m = m_1 + m_2`. This is a fundamental selection rule.\n    *   In our case, we want the probability for the outcome `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1` for an initial state with `m = -1`. Since `-1 ≠ (-1) + (-1)`, the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1>` is zero.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Because the condition `m = m_1 + m_2` is not satisfied, the state `|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>` is not a component of the state `|l=2, m=-1>`. Therefore, it is impossible to obtain this measurement result. The probability is 0.\n\nTo be explicit, the state `|1, 1, 2, -1>` expands in the uncoupled basis as:\n`|1, 1, 2, -1> = (1/√2)|1, 0>|1, -1> + (1/√2)|1, -1>|1, 0>`\nAs you can see from the expansion, the basis state `|1, -1>|1, -1>` (which corresponds to `m_1=-1, m_2=-1`) is not part of this superposition. Its coefficient is zero. The probability is the square of this coefficient, which is also zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
