    "*   **Analysis of Compound X from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   `3400–2500 cm-1 (broad)`: This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, where the broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n        *   `1720 cm-1`: This strong peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   `1610 cm-1` and `1450 cm-1`: These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: The compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a benzene ring.\n\n    2.  **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: A broad singlet this far downfield is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded by the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the protons at 7.2 ppm are shielded by an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`, `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`, `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`, `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: These signals describe the alkyl substituent. Let's piece them together:\n            *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This is a `CH3-CH2-` fragment.\n            *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). This is a `CH3-CH<` fragment.\n            *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2 protons is the methylene group (-CH2-). It is adjacent to the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and the methine group at 2.9 ppm.\n            *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton is the methine group (-CH-). It is attached to the benzene ring (which explains its downfield shift), the methyl group at 1.4 ppm, and the methylene group at 1.7 ppm.\n        *   Assembling the alkyl group: The fragments `CH3-CH2-` and `CH3-CH<` are connected through the methine and methylene groups. The structure is `CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-`, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    3.  **Structure of Compound X:**\n        *   Combining all the pieces, Compound X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para (4) position.\n        *   The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option D. However, the question asks for the final product of the reaction.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n    1.  **Reagents:** Compound X reacts with **red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    2.  **Transformation:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH3). Other functional groups like alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones are also reduced to the corresponding alkanes.\n    3.  **Applying to Compound X:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a methyl group. The sec-butyl group and the benzene ring will remain unchanged.\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Identifying the Final Product**\n\n    *   The calculated product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n    *   Let's compare this to the given options:\n        *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n        *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our derived product.\n        *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer.\n        *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
