    "This problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The core principle connecting the lifetime of a state and its energy is the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state (τ).\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n*   **Energy Linewidth:** For an unstable state with a finite lifetime τ, its energy is not perfectly defined. Instead, it has an energy spread or \"linewidth\" (ΔE) given by the uncertainty principle. As a common and good approximation, we can use:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n*   **Resolving Two Energy Levels:** To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two separate energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E2 - E1|) must be larger than their energy uncertainties. A standard criterion is that the energy difference should be at least as large as the sum of their individual linewidths (ΔE1 + ΔE2). However, a simpler and often sufficient condition is that the energy difference must be significantly larger than the larger of the two individual linewidths. The state with the *shorter* lifetime will have the *larger* energy uncertainty, which will be the dominant factor.\n\n*   **Step-by-step Calculation:**\n    1.  **Identify the lifetimes:**\n        *   τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    2.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state:**\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n    3.  **Determine the condition for resolution:** The energy levels of the two states have widths of about 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV and 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV. The total width of the combined system is dominated by the larger uncertainty, ΔE1. To resolve them, the energy separation |E2 - E1| must be greater than this dominant uncertainty.\n        |E2 - E1| > ΔE1\n        |E2 - E1| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    4.  **Compare with the given options:** We need to find an energy difference that satisfies this condition.\n        *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (<< 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n        *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV   (<< 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n        *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV   (<< 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n        *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV   (>> 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n    Only option D provides an energy difference large enough to ensure the two energy levels, with their inherent uncertainties, can be clearly distinguished. The other options represent energy differences that are smaller than the natural linewidth of the first state, meaning the two levels would significantly overlap and be unresolvable.\n\n*   **Python Code for Verification:**\n\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 10e-9\ntau2 = 10e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using Delta_E ~ h_bar / tau\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The minimum energy separation required to resolve the levels should be\n# greater than the individual linewidths. The larger linewidth is the limiting factor.\nmin_separation = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\n# For clear resolution, the energy difference should be significantly larger than the sum of the half-widths,\n# which is on the order of the larger linewidth.\n# Let's calculate the sum of the linewidths for a more stringent condition (Rayleigh criterion).\ntotal_linewidth = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Linewidth of state 1 (Delta_E1): {delta_E1:.2e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Linewidth of state 2 (Delta_E2): {delta_E2:.2e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The energy difference must be greater than the larger linewidth, which is ~{min_separation:.2e} eV.\")\nprint(f\"For clearer resolution, the difference should be greater than the sum of linewidths: {total_linewidth:.2e} eV.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 1e-11 eV -> Too small\")\nprint(f\"B) 1e-9 eV  -> Too small\")\nprint(f\"C) 1e-8 eV  -> Too small\")\nprint(f\"D) 1e-4 eV  -> Sufficiently large\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The relationship between the lifetime of an energy state (Δt or τ) and the uncertainty or \"spread\" in its energy (ΔE) is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. A common form of this principle is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ\n    where ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant. For this problem, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\n2.  **State the condition for resolution:** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be clearly distinguishable or \"resolved,\" the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be larger than their respective energy uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy uncertainty, and this larger uncertainty is the limiting factor for resolution. Therefore, the energy difference must be significantly greater than the larger of the two energy linewidths (ΔE1 and ΔE2).\n    |E1 - E2| > max(ΔE1, ΔE2)\n\n3.  **List the given values:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ1) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ2) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n4.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state:**\n    *   For state 1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   For state 2: ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the minimum required energy difference:**\n    The larger of the two energy uncertainties is ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. To clearly resolve the two states, their energy difference must be greater than this value.\n    |E1 - E2| > 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare this requirement with the given options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Only option D provides an energy difference that is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<D>>>"
