    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and reaction.**\n    The problem involves the calcium-EDTA complex, denoted as $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex is formed from the reaction between a calcium ion ($Ca^{2+}$) and an EDTA ion ($EDTA^{4-}$). The formation reaction is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n2.  **Understand the given equilibrium constant.**\n    The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for this reaction, which is a measure of how strongly the complex is formed.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    A large $K_f$ value indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the complex is very stable and does not readily dissociate.\n\n3.  **Consider the dissociation of the complex.**\n    Since we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, it is more convenient to work with the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the dissociation constant ($K_d$).**\n    The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction, $K_d$, is the reciprocal of the formation constant, $K_f$.\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n5.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    We can use an ICE table to track the concentrations of the species as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n6.  **Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x.**\n    Using the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table and the value of $K_d$:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n7.  **Apply a simplifying assumption.**\n    Because the dissociation constant ($K_d = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$) is extremely small, we can assume that the amount of complex that dissociates (x) is negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). Therefore, we can approximate the equilibrium concentration of the complex as:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n8.  **Calculate the concentration of Calcium ions.**\n    Substituting the approximation into the equilibrium expression:\n    $\\frac{x^2}{0.02} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n    Now, solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-2})$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
