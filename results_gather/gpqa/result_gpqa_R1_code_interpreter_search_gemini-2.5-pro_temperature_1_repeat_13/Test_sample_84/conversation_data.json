    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   R_star is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that the star is the same for both planets (so T_star and R_star are constant) and that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((1 / a1) / (1 / a2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n    The problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2 / a1.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data:** The radial velocity (RV) method provides information about the star's wobble caused by the orbiting planet. For a circular orbit, the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by:\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, G is the gravitational constant, and `a` is the semi-major axis.\n    *Note: This formula assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star) and that we are viewing the system edge-on (sin(i) = 1), which gives the maximum possible RV shift.*\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We need to rearrange the formula to express `a` in terms of K.\n    K^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\n    K^2 = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)\n    a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n7.  **Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\n    a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]\n    The terms G and M_star are the same for both planets and cancel out.\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n8.  **Determine the Ratios of Mass and RV Amplitude:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n        M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):** The radial velocity (v_r) is related to the Doppler shift (Δλ) by v_r = c * (Δλ / λ_0). The RV amplitude (K) is proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max).\n        K ∝ Δλ_max\n        Therefore, K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2.\n        Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n        K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n9.  **Calculate the Ratio a2 / a1:** Substitute the mass and RV amplitude ratios into the equation from step 7.\n    a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into the equation from step 4.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n11. **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given ratios\n# Mass ratio of planet 2 to planet 1\nMp2_over_Mp1 = 5.0 / 7.0\n\n# The radial velocity amplitude K is proportional to the Doppler shift delta_lambda.\n# Ratio of the radial velocity amplitude of star due to planet 1 to that due to planet 2\nK1_over_K2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is equal to sqrt(a2 / a1),\n# where 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n# The semi-major axis 'a' is proportional to (Mp/K)^2.\n# Therefore, a2 / a1 = (Mp2 / Mp1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes\nratio_a2_over_a1 = (Mp2_over_Mp1)**2 * (K1_over_K2)**2\n\n# The temperature ratio is the square root of the semi-major axis ratio\nratio_Teq1_over_Teq2 = math.sqrt(ratio_a2_over_a1)\n\nprint(ratio_Teq1_over_Teq2)\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`).\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]`\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are the same) and have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`), the formula simplifies to:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((1 / a1) / (1 / a2))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`. We can determine this from the radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, K, is given by:\n\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)` (assuming `M_p << M_star`)\n\nRearranging for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\n`K^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)`\n`a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n\n`a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out:\n\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2)`\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (`M_p1`) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet2 (`M_p2`) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (`Δλ_1`) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (`Δλ_2`) = 0.04 Å\n\nThe RV amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the Doppler shift `Δλ`. Therefore, `K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n*   `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n*   `K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\nNow, calculate `a2 / a1`:\n`a2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784`\n\nFinally, calculate the temperature ratio:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28`\n\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
