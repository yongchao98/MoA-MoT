    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between acid molecules. An alcohol O-H is also in this region but is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically observed around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C). This means it is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of the alkene group, which was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a plausible chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group, -COOH.\n        *   Mass = (1 x Carbon) + (2 x Oxygen) + (1 x Hydrogen)\n        *   Mass ≈ (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The [COOH]⁺ fragment is a very common and stable fragment observed in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids. This piece of data provides strong confirmation for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we have concluded that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B) C6H12O and C) C6H10O, which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with A) C6H10O2 and D) C6H12O2. To distinguish between these, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    *   Our molecule has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means it must have a total of **2 degrees of unsaturation**.\n\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For D) C6H12O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n            This formula corresponds to a molecule with only one degree of unsaturation. This would represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), where the only pi bond is the C=O. This contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n            This formula corresponds to a molecule with two degrees of unsaturation. This perfectly accommodates one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond, consistent with all the spectral evidence. An example structure would be hexenoic acid.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The evidence from all three characterization techniques points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid. Only the formula C6H10O2 has the required two oxygen atoms and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl and the alkene functional groups.\n\n<<<A>>>"
