    "An object appears to be the color of the light it reflects or transmits, while it absorbs the other colors. The color it absorbs is the complementary color of the color it appears. In this case, the dye emits light, which is the color we see. We need to find the color of this emitted light and then determine its complementary color, which will be the color of the absorbed light.\n\n1.  **Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light.**\n    The relationship between the energy (E) of a photon and its wavelength (λ) is given by the formula:\n    λ = hc / E\n    where:\n    *   h is Planck's constant\n    *   c is the speed of light\n    *   E is the energy of the photon\n\n    A convenient formula for converting energy in electron volts (eV) to wavelength in nanometers (nm) is:\n    λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\n    Given the energy of the emitted light is E = 2.3393 eV:\n    λ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV\n    λ ≈ 530.1 nm\n\n2.  **Determine the color of the emitted light.**\n    We need to find where a wavelength of approximately 530 nm falls within the visible light spectrum.\n    *   Violet: 380–450 nm\n    *   Blue: 450–495 nm\n    *   Green: 495–570 nm\n    *   Yellow: 570–590 nm\n    *   Orange: 590–620 nm\n    *   Red: 620–750 nm\n\n    A wavelength of 530.1 nm falls squarely in the **green** part of the spectrum. Therefore, the dye emits green light.\n\n3.  **Find the complementary (absorbed) color.**\n    The color of light a substance absorbs is the complementary color to the color it reflects or emits. We need to find the complementary color of green.\n\n    Using a color wheel:\n    *   The complementary color of Red is Cyan.\n    *   The complementary color of Green is Magenta (or often simplified to Red in introductory chemistry).\n    *   The complementary color of Blue is Yellow.\n\n    A more precise look at complementary colors for light absorption/emission:\n    *   Violet light is absorbed -> substance appears Yellow-Green.\n    *   Blue light is absorbed -> substance appears Yellow.\n    *   Green-Blue light is absorbed -> substance appears Orange.\n    *   Blue-Green light is absorbed -> substance appears Red.\n    *   **Green light is absorbed -> substance appears Magenta/Red-Violet.**\n    *   Yellow-Green light is absorbed -> substance appears Violet.\n    *   Yellow light is absorbed -> substance appears Blue.\n    *   Orange light is absorbed -> substance appears Green-Blue.\n    *   **Red light is absorbed -> substance appears Blue-Green/Cyan.**\n\n    Since the dye *emits* **green** light, it must be *absorbing* the complementary color, which is in the **red** region of the spectrum. The absorbed energy corresponds to a different transition than the emitted energy (due to Stokes shift), but the question asks what color of light is absorbed by the compound to produce this emission. The color an object absorbs is complementary to the color it appears. The dye appears green (emits green light), so it absorbs red light.\n\nTherefore, the color of light absorbed by the organic compound is Red.\n\n<<<C>>>"
