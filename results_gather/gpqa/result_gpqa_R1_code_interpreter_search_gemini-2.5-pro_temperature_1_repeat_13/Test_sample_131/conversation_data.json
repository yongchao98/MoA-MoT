    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given the following information about a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nFirst, let's confirm that all proposed tetramethylbenzene isomers and 1,4-diethylbenzene have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 * C4H12 = C10H14. This is correct.\n*   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4 * C4H10 = C10H14. This is correct.\n\nNext, we predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound based on its molecular symmetry. The number of signals corresponds to the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. These two sets are not equivalent to each other. This will produce **two singlets**, each for 6H (a 1:1 ratio between them).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyls) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl and a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon C5, which has a methyl) are in different environments. This will produce **two singlets**, each for 1H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** Detailed analysis (or looking up reference spectra) shows three sets of equivalent protons. Two methyl groups are accidentally equivalent. This results in **three singlets** with an integration of 6H:3H:3H (or a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The alkyl protons will show splitting. The -CH2- group will be a **quartet** and the -CH3 group will be a **triplet**. The problem states all signals are singlets in the alkyl region, so we can immediately eliminate this compound and **Option D**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixtures (Options A, B, C)**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Total Aromatic Protons** in the 1:1 mixture = 2 (from compound 1) + 2 (from compound 2) = 4H. The observed spectrum has two signals in a 1:1 ratio. This means the signals must correspond to 2H and 2H.\n*   **Total Methyl Protons** in the 1:1 mixture = 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24H. The observed spectrum has three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. This corresponds to integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H (since 12 + 6 + 6 = 24, and 12:6:6 = 2:1:1).\n\nLet's test the remaining options against these requirements.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-) and two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-). This would give three signals (2H:1H:1H) unless the two 1H signals from 1,2,3,5- accidentally overlap perfectly to give a 2H signal. This is possible but relies on coincidence.\n    *   Alkyl signals: Two 6H singlets (from 1,2,3,4-) and three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H (from 1,2,3,5-). This gives a total of five signals. To get the required three signals (12H, 6H, 6H) would require multiple, complex overlaps. This is highly unlikely.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-) and two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-). This again gives three signals unless there is an accidental overlap of the two 1H signals.\n    *   Alkyl signals: One 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-) and three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H (from 1,2,3,5-). This gives four signals. It could be reduced to three if the two 3H signals overlap, but the resulting integrations would be 12H, 6H, 6H (a 2:1:1 ratio). This fits the alkyl region but relies on two separate coincidental overlaps (one in the aromatic, one in the alkyl).\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, these two non-equivalent compounds will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to 2H. The ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4- gives two singlets, each for 6H. Combining these gives a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR data without requiring any coincidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<C>>>"
