    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n        *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically and magnetically equivalent vinylic protons. The chemical shift is downfield due to electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Maleic acid is *cis*-butenedioic acid, and its dehydration yields the five-membered cyclic anhydride. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent.\n\n    *   **Reactant 2:** **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene. The structure has a five-membered ring with double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4. Methyl groups are attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. Carbon 5 is a CH₂ group. The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is typically the major product, formed under kinetic control. The *exo* product is the minor product.\n    *   Major product = *endo* adduct.\n    *   Minor product = *exo* adduct.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula of the product: C₄H₂O₃ (maleic anhydride) + C₉H₁₄ (diene) → C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Products and Assign Protons:**\n    Let's draw the product and use standard bicyclic numbering.\n    *   The diene's C1-C4 and the dienophile's two carbons form a new six-membered ring.\n    *   A new C=C double bond is formed between the diene's C2 and C3 positions. These carbons each bear a methyl group.\n    *   The diene's C1 and C4 become the bridgehead carbons. These carbons also each bear a methyl group.\n    *   The diene's C5 (the CH₂ group) becomes the C7 bridge of the bicyclic system.\n    *   The maleic anhydride carbons become C5 and C6, with the anhydride ring fused to the structure. The two protons from the maleic anhydride are on C5 and C6.\n\n    Let's predict the ¹H NMR signals for the product:\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). These are shielded and should appear upfield. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Vinyl Methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the new C=C double bond (C2, C3). These are deshielded compared to the bridgehead methyls. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (Hₐ):** Two equivalent protons on C5 and C6. They are alpha to carbonyl groups, so they are significantly deshielded. The adjacent bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) are quaternary, so these protons will not be split. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridge Protons (C7-H):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C=C double bond, one is *anti*). They will couple to each other (geminal coupling) but not to the quaternary bridgehead carbons. They should appear as two doublets. The problem mentions a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, which is one of these protons.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra to Distinguish *Endo* and *Exo* Isomers:**\n    *   **NOESY** (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find a pair of protons that are uniquely close in the *endo* isomer.\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** In the *endo* configuration, the anhydride ring (and its protons, Hₐ) is tucked underneath the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge. This brings the anhydride protons (Hₐ on C5/C6) into close proximity with the protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** In the *exo* configuration, the anhydride ring points away from the C7 bridge. The Hₐ protons are now far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n    Therefore, the NOE cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product is between the **anhydride protons (Hₐ)** and the **C7 bridge protons**.\n\n5.  **Match the Protons to the Resonances in the Options:**\n    *   The anhydride protons (Hₐ) give the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   One of the C7 bridge protons gives the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n    The NOESY cross-peak in the major product will connect these two signals.\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 bridge proton). These are not uniquely close in the endo isomer.\n    B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). These would be close in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product.\n    C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. These are two different methyl groups. An NOE between them would likely exist in both isomers.\n    D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). This matches our analysis perfectly. This spatial proximity is the defining characteristic of the *endo* isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
