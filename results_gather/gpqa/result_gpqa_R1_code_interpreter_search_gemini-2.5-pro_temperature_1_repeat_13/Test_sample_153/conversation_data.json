    "*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of about 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%).\n    *   The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a hallmark signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (³⁵Cl isotope is ~75% abundant, ³⁷Cl isotope is ~25% abundant, giving a ~3:1 ratio).\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight for the proposed structures using the most common isotopes (C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35). The formula for all options except A (which is an isomer) is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   MW = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   This molecular weight matches the M+ peak. The MS data confirms the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded in a dimeric form.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This frequency is typical for a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Together, these two peaks are definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (deshielded) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It is a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons and integrates to one proton (1H).\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and they split each other into doublets.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Lacks a carboxylic acid group. It would not show the broad O-H IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted benzoic acid. While it is a carboxylic acid and has the correct molecular formula, the four protons on the benzene ring would be in unique chemical environments, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted benzoic acid.\n        *   It has the correct molecular formula (C₇H₅ClO₂) and contains chlorine, matching the MS data.\n        *   It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR data (broad O-H and C=O stretch).\n        *   It has a carboxylic acid proton, matching the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n        *   It is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) ring, which would produce the observed pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum. The two protons next to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the two protons next to the -Cl atom are slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm). This structure perfectly fits all the provided data.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have the characteristic broad O-H IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm. Instead, it would have an aldehyde proton signal around 9-10 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:** All spectroscopic evidence points unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
