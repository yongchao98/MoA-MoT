    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Principle:** The problem describes the population of atoms in different energy levels within the photospheres of stars. Since the stars are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms across energy states is governed by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in a higher energy state (`N_j`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (`N_i`) as a function of temperature (`T`):\n\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `N_j / N_i` is the ratio of the number of atoms in state `j` to state `i`. This ratio is a measure of the \"excitation\".\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the respective energy levels. These are intrinsic properties of the iron atom and are the same for both stars.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels (`E_j - E_i`).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately `1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars:** We can write the Boltzmann equation for each star. Let the excitation ratio (`N_j / N_i`) for star_1 be `R_1` and for star_2 be `R_2`. The temperatures are `T_1` and `T_2` respectively.\n\n    *   For star_1: `R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n    *   For star_2: `R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n4.  **Use the Information from the Problem:** The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This translates to the mathematical relationship:\n\n    `R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** Now, substitute the expressions for `R_1` and `R_2` into this relationship:\n\n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Equation:** The term for the statistical weights, `(g_j / g_i)`, is a constant for the specific energy levels of iron, so it's the same on both sides and can be canceled out:\n\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n7.  **Solve for the Temperatures:** To deal with the exponents, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides of the equation:\n\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n8.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the equation to get `ln(2)` on one side:\n\n    `ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n    `(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parentheses by finding a common denominator (`T_1 * T_2`):\n\n    `(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n9.  **Substitute the Given Numerical Values:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is a fundamental physical constant with the value `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\n    Let's compute the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n\n    `ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n\n    The numerical values were chosen specifically to make this ratio equal to 1.\n\n10. **Final Equation:** Substitute this value back into our derived equation:\n\n    `1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n    This simplifies to:\n\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
