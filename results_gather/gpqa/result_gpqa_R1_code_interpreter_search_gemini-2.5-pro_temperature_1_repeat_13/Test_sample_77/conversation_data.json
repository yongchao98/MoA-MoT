    "This question is asking for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge. These are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a point charge moving along a specified trajectory.\n\n**1. Understanding the Setup**\n\n*   A point charge `q` is moving along a path `s(t)`.\n*   We want to find the potentials `V` and `A` at a specific point in space `r` and at a specific time `t`.\n*   Due to the finite speed of light `c`, the fields (and thus potentials) at `(r, t)` are not determined by the charge's position at time `t`, but by its position at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, `tr`.\n*   The retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r` is exactly `t - tr`.\n*   Let `s(tr)` be the position of the charge at the retarded time. The distance the light travels is `|r - s(tr)|`.\n*   Therefore, the defining equation for `tr` is: `|r - s(tr)| = c(t - tr)`.\n\n**2. Notation from the Question**\n\n*   `d` is the vector from the source at `tr` to the observation point `r`. So, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n*   `d` is the magnitude of this vector, `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   `v` is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   Using this notation, the retarded time condition becomes `d = c(t - tr)`.\n\n**3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\n\nThe standard formulas for the retarded potentials of a point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. They are derived by solving the inhomogeneous wave equations for V and A with the source terms for a point charge (a charge density `ρ` and current density `J` represented by Dirac delta functions).\n\nThe derivation involves a careful evaluation of the retarded potential integrals:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\nThe key result of this evaluation is that the motion of the source introduces a correction factor in the denominator. The potentials are not simply the static potentials evaluated at the retarded position.\n\nThe resulting potentials are:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (|r - s(tr)| * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c))]`\nwhere `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the field point.\n\nLet's rewrite the denominator in terms of the variables given in the question:\nDenominator = `|r - s(tr)| * (1 - (d / |r - s(tr)|) ⋅ v / c)`\n= `d * (1 - (d ⋅ v) / (d * c))`\n= `d - (d ⋅ v) / c`\n= `(dc - d ⋅ v) / c`\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for V:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((dc - d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n`V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\nThe derivation for the vector potential is analogous. The source `J` is just `ρv`, so the resulting potential is simply `v` times the scalar potential part (with appropriate constants).\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (|r - s(tr)| * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c))]`\n\nUsing the same denominator simplification:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / ((dc - d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**4. Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n*   `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n*   `A(r,t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nThese expressions perfectly match option C.\n\nLet's check the relationship `A = (v/c²)V` which is often a useful shortcut.\n`(v/c²) * V = (v/c²) * [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))]`\nUsing `c² = 1/(μ₀ε₀)`, we have `1/c² = μ₀ε₀`:\n`= v * μ₀ε₀ * [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))]`\n`= (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\nThis is exactly the expression for `A(r,t)`. Option C also satisfies this relationship.\n\n*   **Option A & B** use the static potential `1/r`, which is incorrect as it ignores retardation.\n*   **Option D** has the wrong sign (`+`) in the denominator. The minus sign is crucial and arises from the Doppler-like effect of the moving source. If the source moves towards the observer (`d ⋅ v > 0`), the denominator becomes smaller, leading to a stronger potential, which is physically correct.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>"
