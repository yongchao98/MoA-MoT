    "The user wants to determine which stars from a given list can be observed by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the W. M. Keck Observatory.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n**1. Define the Observability Criteria**\n\nFor a star to be observable by *both* instruments, it must meet two conditions:\n*   **Visibility:** It must be visible from the location of both observatories.\n*   **Brightness:** Its apparent V magnitude (m_V) must be brighter than the limits of both instruments.\n\n**2. Analyze the Visibility Criterion**\n\nA celestial object is visible from a given latitude if its declination (DEC) is greater than the latitude minus 90 degrees.\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):**\n    *   Latitude: ~24.6° S = -24.6°\n    *   Visibility condition: DEC > -24.6° - 90° => DEC > -114.6°\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):**\n    *   Latitude: ~19.8° N = +19.8°\n    *   Visibility condition: DEC > 19.8° - 90° => DEC > -70.2°\n\nFor a star to be visible from *both* locations, it must satisfy the stricter of the two conditions, which is **DEC > -70.2°**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Brightness Criterion**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit:** Apparent V magnitude (m_V) < 17.0 mag\n*   **HIRES Limit:** Apparent V magnitude (m_V) < 16.0 mag\n\nFor a star to be observable by *both* instruments, it must satisfy the stricter condition, which is **m_V < 16.0 mag**.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Star**\n\nNow, we will calculate the apparent V magnitude (m_V) for each star and check if it meets both the visibility (DEC > -70.2°) and brightness (m_V < 16.0) criteria.\n\nThe relationship between apparent magnitude (m_V), absolute magnitude (M_V), distance (d in parsecs), and absorption (A_V) is given by the distance modulus formula:\nm_V = M_V - 5 + 5 * log10(d) + A_V\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   RA = 15 deg, **DEC = -75 deg**\n    *   M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, A_V = 0\n    *   **Visibility:** The declination (-75°) is less than -70.2°. Therefore, Star 1 is **not visible** from the Keck Observatory.\n    *   *Conclusion: Cannot be observed by both.*\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   RA = 30 deg, DEC = 55 deg\n    *   **m_V = 16.5 mag**\n    *   **Brightness:** The apparent magnitude (16.5) is not less than 16.0. Therefore, Star 2 is too faint for HIRES.\n    *   *Conclusion: Cannot be observed by both.*\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   RA = 11 h, **DEC = 48 deg**\n    *   **m_V = 15.5 mag**\n    *   **Visibility:** The declination (48°) is greater than -70.2°. It is visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** The apparent magnitude (15.5) is less than 16.0. It is bright enough for both instruments.\n    *   *Conclusion: Can be observed by both.*\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   RA = 85 deg, **DEC = -48 deg**\n    *   M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc\n    *   Absorption A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   **Visibility:** The declination (-48°) is greater than -70.2°. It is visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** m_V = 15.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) + 1.24 = 15.5 - 5 + 5 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**. This is not less than 16.0, making it too faint for HIRES.\n    *   *Conclusion: Cannot be observed by both.*\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   RA = 10 h, **DEC = 60 deg**\n    *   M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc, A_V = 0\n    *   **Visibility:** The declination (60°) is greater than -70.2°. It is visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** m_V = 16.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(5) = 11.5 + 5 * (0.699) ≈ 11.5 + 3.495 = **14.995 mag**. This is less than 16.0, making it bright enough for both instruments.\n    *   *Conclusion: Can be observed by both.*\n\n**Final Result**\nThe stars that satisfy all conditions for observation by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
