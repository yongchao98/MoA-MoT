    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial reaction to identify product 1.**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. This is a norbornadiene derivative, which is an excellent dienophile (it has two reactive C=C double bonds).\n*   **Reactant 2:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n\nThe reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with NaI is a known method to generate a highly reactive diene in situ. The reaction proceeds via debromination to form 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene, more commonly known as *o*-xylylene or *o*-quinodimethane.\n\n*o*-Xylylene is a planar molecule containing a conjugated system of three double bonds. It is a potent diene for Diels-Alder reactions. The reactive diene part is the s-cis configured system formed by the two exocyclic double bonds and the two ring carbons they are attached to.\n\nThe problem states that 2 equivalents of the *o*-xylylene precursor are used for every one equivalent of the norbornadiene derivative. Since norbornadiene has two double bonds, it will undergo two successive Diels-Alder reactions, one with each molecule of the generated *o*-xylylene.\n\nThe Diels-Alder reaction between *o*-xylylene (diene) and a dienophile (C=C) results in a remarkable transformation. A new six-membered ring is formed, and the six-membered ring of the *o*-xylylene becomes aromatic (a benzene ring) due to the rearrangement of double bonds. This aromatization provides a strong thermodynamic driving force for the reaction.\n\nSo, product **1** is the bis-adduct, formed by the addition of two *o*-xylylene molecules to the two double bonds of the 7-(tert-butoxy)norbornadiene. The resulting structure is a central, now saturated, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core, fused on two sides to complex polycyclic systems, each containing a benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of product 2.**\n\n*   Product **1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n\nAqueous acid is used to cleave tert-butyl ethers. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) at the C7 position is protonated, and the stable tert-butyl cation departs, leaving a hydroxyl group (-OH).\nSo, product **2** is the same as **1**, but with a hydroxyl group at C7.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of product 3.**\n\n*   Product **2** is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n\nThis set of reagents corresponds to the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing alcohols. The secondary alcohol at C7 in product **2** is oxidized to a ketone (C=O).\nSo, product **3** is the same as **2**, but with a ketone group at C7. The central core is now a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-7-one derivative.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the final product 4.**\n\n*   Product **3** is heated to 150°C.\n\nComplex molecules formed via Diels-Alder reactions often undergo a retro-Diels-Alder reaction upon heating. Product **3** was formed from two Diels-Alder reactions. Heating it will cause it to break apart into its constituent components.\n\n**3** → [7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene] + 2 × [*o*-xylylene]\n\nThe central fragment, 7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, is known to be thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, losing a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form benzene. This is an irreversible step that drives the entire retro-cycloaddition process.\n\n[7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene] → Benzene + CO\n\nThe other fragments are two molecules of the highly reactive *o*-xylylene. They cannot be isolated and will react with each other. The most common reaction of *o*-xylylene is dimerization. The thermal dimerization typically proceeds via a diradical mechanism or a formal [4+4] cycloaddition to yield **5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene**. This is the final stable organic product, **4**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.**\n\nThe structure of product **4** is 5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene. This molecule consists of two benzene rings fused to a central eight-membered ring. The eight-membered ring adopts a stable, non-planar \"tub\" conformation.\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. The tub conformation possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry, which passes through the midpoints of the two bonds connecting the benzene rings.\n\nThe presence of a C₂ axis means that any atom on one side of the axis is equivalent to a corresponding atom on the other side. Therefore, we only need to count the number of distinct protons in one half of the molecule.\n\nLet's analyze one half, which consists of one benzene ring and one -CH₂-CH₂- bridge connecting to the other half.\n*   **Aromatic Hydrogens:** The benzene ring has 4 hydrogen atoms. Since there are no other symmetry elements (like a mirror plane) passing through this half of the molecule, all four of these protons are in chemically distinct environments. This gives **4 signals** for the aromatic region.\n*   **Aliphatic Hydrogens:** The bridge consists of a -C₅H₂-C₆H₂- fragment.\n    *   The C₂ axis does not relate C₅ to C₆. So, the two methylene (-CH₂-) groups are chemically distinct.\n    *   On each methylene group, the two geminal protons are diastereotopic because the molecule is chiral (due to the C₂ symmetry) and non-planar. This means the two hydrogens on C₅ are distinct from each other, and the two hydrogens on C₆ are distinct from each other.\n    *   Therefore, all four protons on the -CH₂-CH₂- bridge are chemically distinct. This gives **4 signals** for the aliphatic region.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is the sum of the distinct aromatic and aliphatic hydrogens: 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = **8**.\n\nThis analysis assumes a static conformation. Even if we consider the alternative chair conformation (which has Cₛ symmetry), the number of distinct signals also comes out to be 8. At very high temperatures, rapid conformational changes might average some signals, but the question implies a standard NMR analysis of the static structure, for which 8 distinct types of hydrogens are present.\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product **4** is 8.\n\n<<<B>>>"
