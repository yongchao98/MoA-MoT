    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe formula for DoU is: C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\nDoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\nDoU = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1\nDoU = 5\nA DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) and one additional double bond, likely a C=O bond.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂ group). One band corresponds to the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other to the symmetric N-H stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. The frequency is too high for a typical amide (which would be <1700 cm⁻¹) but is perfect for an ester, especially an α,β-unsaturated or aromatic ester.\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester group (-COO-).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\nLet's analyze each signal:\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet (t) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is the upfield part of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet (q) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) next to the methyl group (-CH₃) identified above, confirming the presence of an ethyl group. The chemical shift is significantly downfield (4.5 ppm), which indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. The broadness is typical for exchangeable protons, and the chemical shift and integration are consistent with the primary amine (-NH₂) protons identified in the IR spectrum. The position suggests it's attached to an aromatic ring.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Having two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is a highly characteristic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split only by their single ortho neighbor, resulting in two doublets. The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group, while the upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is ortho to an electron-donating group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure:**\nFrom the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   An ethyl ester group: -COOCH₂CH₃\n*   A primary amine group: -NH₂\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring\n\nThe two substituents on the benzene ring are the amine (-NH₂) and the ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The -NH₂ group is electron-donating, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield. This corresponds to the doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n*   The -COOCH₂CH₃ group is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the ortho protons, shifting them downfield. This corresponds to the doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\nPlacing these groups at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The molecular formula for this compound is C₉H₁₁NO₂, which matches the given information.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options:**\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Has a secondary amide (-NH-), inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR.\n*   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Matches all IR and NMR data perfectly.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Has a meta-substitution pattern, which would produce a more complex NMR signal in the aromatic region, not two doublets.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate (H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃): This is an isomer, but it's a phenyl ester. The -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl would appear around 2.5 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. The signal at 4.5 ppm is characteristic of a -CH₂- attached to an ester oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the data unambiguously points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
