    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **System Properties:** We are dealing with four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**. Identical fermions are indistinguishable and must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**.\n\n2.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For an electron in a potential well, a quantum state is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and its spin projection (quantum number `ms`). Since `ms` can be +1/2 (spin up) or -1/2 (spin down), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles.\n\n3.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by:\n    E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\n    The problem defines a base energy unit E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2).\n    Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n    E_n = n^2 * E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n    *   n=1 level: E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n    *   n=2 level: E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n    *   n=3 level: E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n    *   n=4 level: E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n    *   and so on.\n\n4.  **Ground State (E_gs) Configuration and Energy:**\n    To find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy up, placing the four particles while respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle (max 2 particles per level).\n    *   The lowest energy level is n=1. We place two particles here.\n    *   The next lowest energy level is n=2. We place the remaining two particles here.\n    *   **Configuration:** Two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=2.\n    *   **Total Energy Calculation:**\n        E_gs = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2)\n        E_gs = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n5.  **First Excited State (E_1st) Configuration and Energy:**\n    The first excited state is the lowest possible energy state above the ground state. It is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (LUMO) of the ground state configuration.\n    *   Ground state HOMO: n=2\n    *   Ground state LUMO: n=3\n    *   We promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   **Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   **Total Energy Calculation:**\n        E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n        E_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n6.  **Second Excited State (E_2nd) Configuration and Energy:**\n    The second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n    *   Ground State Energy: 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy: 15E\n    *   Let's consider other possible single-particle excitations from the ground state configuration (two in n=1, two in n=2):\n        *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n            *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n            *   Energy = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n        *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n            *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n            *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n        *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n            *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n            *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\n    Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E,...), the second-lowest energy is 18E.\n    *   **Energy of the second excited state:** E_2nd = **18E**\n\n### Summary\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nTo be absolutely certain, we can use a small program to systematically generate all possible configurations for the 4 particles and calculate their energies.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# We want to find the 3 lowest unique energies for a system of 4 fermions.\n# A state is defined by the occupation numbers [o1, o2, o3, ...], where oi is\n# the number of particles in the energy level n=i.\n# Constraints: sum(oi) = 4 and oi is in {0, 1, 2} (Pauli exclusion).\n\n# Let's consider the first 6 energy levels.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are classified as **fermions**.\n\n2.  **Key Principle for Fermions:** Identical fermions must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For particles in a potential well, a quantum state is defined by both its spatial quantum number (in this case, the energy level `n`) and its spin quantum number (`m_s`). Since the particles are spin-1/2, `m_s` can be either +1/2 (spin-up) or -1/2 (spin-down). Therefore, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n3.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** For a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the energy for a single particle in the `n`-th level is given by:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n    The problem defines the base energy unit as E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²).\n    So, the single-particle energy levels can be written as:\n    *   E₁ = 1² * E = 1E\n    *   E₂ = 2² * E = 4E\n    *   E₃ = 3² * E = 9E\n    *   E₄ = 4² * E = 16E\n    *   and so on for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\n\n4.  **Calculating the Total Energy of the System:** The total energy of the four-particle system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.\n\n    *   **Ground State (Lowest Energy State):**\n        To find the ground state energy, we must fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n        -   Place the first two particles in the n=1 level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n        -   Place the remaining two particles in the next available level, n=2 (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n        -   The configuration is: two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n        -   The total ground state energy (E_gs) is:\n            E_gs = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n    *   **First Excited State:**\n        The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level of the ground state (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n        -   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n        -   The total energy of the first excited state (E_1st) is:\n            E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n    *   **Second Excited State:**\n        The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state and find the second-lowest energy increase.\n        -   **Possibility 1 (already found):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E. This is the first excited state.\n        -   **Possibility 2:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n            -   Configuration: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n            -   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n        -   **Possibility 3:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n            -   Configuration: two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n            -   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n        -   **Possibility 4:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n            -   Configuration: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=4.\n            -   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\n        Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (first excited state) and the second-lowest is 18E.\n        -   The total energy of the second excited state (E_2nd) is **18E**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    -   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    -   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    -   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis matches option B. The previous code execution confirmed these values.\n\n<<<B>>>"
