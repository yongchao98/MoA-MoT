    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star = Star's temperature\n    *   R_star = Star's radius\n    *   a = Planet's semi-major axis (orbital radius for a circular orbit)\n    *   A = Planet's albedo\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a4))^(1/2) * (1 - A4)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, so A4 = A2. The term (1 - A)^(1/4) cancels out.\n    *   The factor of 2 in the denominator also cancels out.\n\n    The simplified expression becomes:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1 / a4)^(1/2) / (1 / a2)^(1/2)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2)\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n    P² ∝ a³  or  P²/a³ = constant\n\n    Therefore, for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    (P2)² / (a2)³ = (P4)² / (a4)³\n\n    Rearranging to find the ratio (a2 / a4):\n    (a2)³ / (a4)³ = (P2)² / (P4)²\n    (a2 / a4)³ = (P2 / P4)²\n    a2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute the Semi-Major Axis Ratio into the Temperature Ratio Equation:**\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P2 / P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Use the Given Orbital Period Ratios:** The problem gives the orbital period ratios as P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we can find the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the period ratio into the equation from step 6.\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet 2 and Planet 4.\nP2_ratio_val = 2\nP4_ratio_val = 3.5\nperiod_ratio = P2_ratio_val / P4_ratio_val\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is equal to (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.8296766467364177\n</execute_output>\nThe calculation gives approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.83\nC) ~0.69\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its semi-major axis (a) by the formula:\nT_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) for planets orbiting the same star:\nP² ∝ a³  or  a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nWe can express the ratio of the semi-major axes in terms of the ratio of their orbital periods:\na_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\nNow, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\nFrom the problem statement, the ratio of orbital periods is given as P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nSo, the ratio P_2 / P_4 is 2 / 3.5.\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.83\nC) ~0.69\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
