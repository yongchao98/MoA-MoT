    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. If the size of the distribution is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation, it can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The problem states the spheroid oscillates along the z-axis, which means we can model this system as an electric dipole with its moment `p` oscillating along the z-axis.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\nwhere:\n*   `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis in this case).\n*   `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency of oscillation and the amplitude of the dipole moment, but not on the angle `θ`.\n\nThe radiated power is a function `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`. We are given that the maximum power radiated is `A`. The maximum power occurs when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (or `π/2` radians).\nSo, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * (1)² = C`.\n\nNow, we need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We substitute this angle into the power formula:\n`P_30 = (dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°) = C * sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nTherefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nSo, the power radiated at 30° is:\n`P_30 = C * (1/4)`\n\nSince we found that `A = C`, we can write:\n`P_30 = A / 4`\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is:\n`Fraction = P_30 / A = (A / 4) / A = 1/4`.\n\nTo be certain of the numerical calculation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Angle in degrees\ntheta_deg = 30\n\n# Convert angle to radians for numpy's sin function\ntheta_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\n\n# Calculate sin^2(theta)\nsin_squared_theta = np.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\n# The maximum value of sin^2(theta) is 1. The fraction is sin_squared_theta / 1.\nfraction = sin_squared_theta\n\nprint(f\"The value of sin^2(30 degrees) is {sin_squared_theta}\")\nprint(f\"The fraction of the maximum power is {fraction}\")\n```\n> The value of sin^2(30 degrees) is 0.24999999999999997\n> The fraction of the maximum power is 0.24999999999999997\n\nThe calculation confirms the fraction is 1/4.\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nNow let's consider the form of the function `f`, specifically its dependence on the wavelength `λ`. The full expression for the power per unit solid angle from an electric dipole is:\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀² * ω⁴) / (32 * π² * ε₀ * c³) * sin²(θ)`\nwhere:\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`.\nLet's look at the dependence of `dP/dΩ` on `λ`. All terms except `ω⁴` are independent of `λ` (assuming the dipole moment `p₀` does not depend on the oscillation frequency).\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nSubstituting `ω = 2πc/λ`, we get:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴`\n\nSo, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`. This is a characteristic feature of dipole radiation and is also the basis for Rayleigh scattering.\n\nTherefore, a possible form for the function `f(λ, θ)` includes a factor of `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining our two findings:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n*   A possible form of the function `f` has a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An oscillating spheroid-shaped charge distribution can be approximated as an oscillating electric dipole, especially when its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation it emits. Let's analyze the radiation from such a dipole.\n\n### 1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is given by the Larmor formula for a dipole:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n*   `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency of oscillation and the amplitude of the dipole moment, but not on the angle `θ`.\n\nThe radiated power is a function `f(λ, θ)`, so `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`.\n\nThe maximum radiated power, denoted by `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n\nSo, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`.\n\nWe are asked to find the fraction of `A` radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We calculate the power at this angle:\n\n`P_30 = (dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°) = C * sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nTherefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n`P_30 = C * (1/4)`\n\nSince `A = C`, the power at 30° is `P_30 = A / 4`.\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is:\n`Fraction = P_30 / A = (A / 4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n### 2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nNow, let's determine the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength `λ`. The constant `C` in the formula above is not truly a constant but depends on the frequency of oscillation. The full expression for the power per unit solid angle is:\n\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀² * ω⁴) / (32 * π² * ε₀ * c³) * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n\nThe function `f(λ, θ)` is `dP/dΩ`. We are interested in its dependence on `λ`. The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by:\n\n`ω = 2π * (frequency) = 2π * (c / λ)`\n\nLooking at the formula for `dP/dΩ`, we can see its dependence on `ω`:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nNow, we substitute the relation for `ω` in terms of `λ`:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThus, a possible form for the function `f` includes a factor of `λ⁻⁴`. This inverse fourth power dependence is characteristic of dipole radiation and is famously known from Rayleigh scattering.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the two results:\n1.  The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n2.  A possible form for the function `f` shows a dependence of **λ⁻⁴** on the wavelength.\n\nMatching these findings with the given options, we find that option B fits both conclusions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
