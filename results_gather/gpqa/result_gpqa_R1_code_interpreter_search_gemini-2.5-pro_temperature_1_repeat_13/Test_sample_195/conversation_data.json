    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\n    For a conservative force like the one described by Hooke's Law ($F=-kx$), the total mechanical energy of the system is conserved. In the context of special relativity, the mechanical energy ($E_{mech}$) is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy ($K$) and the potential energy ($U$).\n    $E_{mech} = K + U = \\text{constant}$\n\n2.  **Define Kinetic and Potential Energy:**\n    *   The potential energy of a spring system is given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving with speed $v$ is given by $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n3.  **Set up the Conservation of Energy Equation:**\n    The total mechanical energy is conserved throughout the oscillation. We can equate the energy at two specific points: the point of maximum displacement (amplitude) and the equilibrium position.\n\n    *   **State 1: At maximum amplitude ($x=A$)**\n        At the maximum amplitude, the mass momentarily comes to a stop.\n        *   Position: $x = A$\n        *   Velocity: $v = 0$\n        *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$\n        *   Kinetic Energy: $K_1 = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$\n        *   Potential Energy: $U_1 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n        *   Total Mechanical Energy: $E_1 = K_1 + U_1 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **State 2: At the equilibrium position ($x=0$)**\n        At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, and the mass reaches its maximum speed.\n        *   Position: $x = 0$\n        *   Velocity: $v = v_{max}$\n        *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n        *   Kinetic Energy: $K_2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n        *   Potential Energy: $U_2 = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$\n        *   Total Mechanical Energy: $E_2 = K_2 + U_2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    By equating the total energy at these two points ($E_1 = E_2$), we get:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:**\n    Now, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$. First, let's isolate $\\gamma_{max}$.\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we can square both sides:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\n    Now, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for the $v_{max}^2/c^2$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, take the square root of both sides and multiply by $c$ to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    This result matches option C. For a check, in the non-relativistic limit ($c \\to \\infty$), the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$ becomes very small, and the expression correctly reduces to the classical result $v_{max} = \\sqrt{kA^2/m}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
