    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester. The structure is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom. It has an ethyl group at position 4, and the stereocenter at this position has the (R) configuration. Such a lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid, specifically (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is the enantiomer of Product 1, with the stereocenter at position 4 having the (S) configuration. It is formed from (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone.\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the different selectivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It selectively reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones to alcohols. It is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It is generally unreactive towards esters.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provided are all mono-isobutyl esters of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid). This molecule has two different carboxylic acid functional groups that can be modified. One end can be a free carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the other can be an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu).\n\nThe parent diacid is HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COOH(5). The chiral center is at C3.\n\nFor the reaction to produce a 6-membered lactone (a pyranone ring), the starting material must be a derivative of a 5-hydroxypentanoic acid. Let's analyze the structure of the starting material. The name in the options, \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid,\" although non-standard, implies a 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid at C1 and an isobutyl ester at C5.\nStructure: **HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COO-iBu(5)**\n\nLet's see if this structure works for both reactions:\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 1: Starting Material A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester** group at C5, leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 untouched.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu  + LiBH₄  →  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n*   The product of the reduction is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the 6-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5, which are not the stereocenter (C3). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained throughout the process. To obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration at C3.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Analyze Reaction 2: Starting Material B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group at C1, leaving the ester group at C5 untouched.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu\n*   The product of the reduction is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The alcohol at C5 attacks the ester carbonyl at C1, displacing isobutanol and forming the same 6-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reactions do not affect the stereocenter at C3. To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
