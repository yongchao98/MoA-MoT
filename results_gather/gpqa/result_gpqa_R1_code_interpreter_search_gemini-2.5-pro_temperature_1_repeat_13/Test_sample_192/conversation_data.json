    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars, let's call it `N`, varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. The phrasing \"varies with\" in this context refers to the number density, meaning the number of stars per unit interval of parallax. We can write this as a proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`) per unit range of distance. This is the number density with respect to distance, which can be written as `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Establish the Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    Distance and parallax are fundamentally related. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The standard formula is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    (where `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds). For the purpose of finding the proportionality, we can use this simple inverse relationship.\n\n4.  **Relate the Number Densities:**\n    To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative of Parallax with Respect to Distance:**\n    We need to find `d(plx)/dr` from the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    Since we are dealing with proportionality and number counts (which are positive), we can consider the magnitude of this change:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| ∝ 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Combine the Proportionalities:**\n    Now, substitute the proportionalities for `dN/d(plx)` and `|d(plx)/dr|` into the chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express the Final Relationship in Terms of Distance (r):**\n    The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. To get the final answer, we must express everything in terms of `r`. Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r²)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nThis result means that the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the cube of the distance.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ r²\nB) ~ r⁴\nC) ~ r³\nD) ~ r⁵\n\nThe calculated relationship matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
