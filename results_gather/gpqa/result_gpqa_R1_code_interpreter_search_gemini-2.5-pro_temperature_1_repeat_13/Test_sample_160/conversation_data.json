    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area that a target particle presents to an incoming particle for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1 (λ1):** This describes the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n        *   Moving particle: Gas molecule.\n        *   Target particles: Other gas molecules.\n        *   The number density of gas molecules is `n`.\n        *   The collision cross-section is σ1. This is the **gas-kinetic cross-section**. It's determined by the physical size of the molecules. For two identical molecules of diameter `d`, the cross-section is roughly σ1 ≈ πd². This type of collision is like two billiard balls hitting each other.\n        *   Therefore, λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1).\n\n    *   **Scenario 2 (λ2):** This describes the mean free path of an electron from the beam colliding with the gas molecules.\n        *   Moving particle: Electron.\n        *   Target particles: Gas molecules.\n        *   The number density `n` of the target gas molecules is the same as in Scenario 1, since the temperature and pressure are constant.\n        *   The collision cross-section is σ2. This is the **electron scattering cross-section**.\n        *   Therefore, λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2).\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2):**\n    *   The crucial difference lies in the nature of the collision.\n    *   **Gas-Gas Collision (σ1):** This is a collision between two neutral particles. The interaction is very short-range, essentially a \"hard-sphere\" or physical contact collision. The effective area (σ1) is based on the physical radii of the molecules.\n    *   **Electron-Gas Collision (σ2):** An electron is a charged particle. A gas molecule, while neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The incoming electron interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron doesn't need to physically \"hit\" the nucleus or an orbital electron to be deflected (scattered). It can be scattered by the atom's electric field from a much larger distance.\n    *   Because of this long-range interaction, the effective target area a gas molecule presents to an electron (σ2) is significantly larger than the physical target area it presents to another neutral gas molecule (σ1).\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude: **σ2 > σ1**.\n\n4.  **Compare the Mean Free Paths (λ1 vs. λ2):**\n    *   We have λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1) and λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2).\n    *   Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), and we have established that σ2 > σ1, it must follow that λ2 < λ1.\n    *   A larger collision cross-section (σ2) means a higher probability of collision per unit distance, which results in a shorter average distance traveled between collisions (a smaller mean free path, λ2).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The mean free path of the electrons (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1) because the electron-gas scattering cross-section is larger than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section. Mike's observation is consistent with fundamental physics.\n\nThe options are:\nA) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation - Incorrect.\nB) λ2 < λ1 - Correct.\nC) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 - Incorrect.\nD) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 - Incorrect.\n\nThe value `1.22` in options C and D is a distractor, likely borrowed from the Rayleigh criterion for optical resolution, and is not relevant to this problem.\n\n<<<B>>>"
