Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?

    "To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). The total mass of a binary star system can be determined using the information from its orbital period and the radial velocities of its components.\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M = m1 + m2) is given by the formula:\n\nM = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))\n\nWhere:\n*   `M` is the total mass of the system.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This implies that we are viewing the systems nearly edge-on, so the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin^3(i) = 1. We will assume this is the case for both systems, which simplifies the formula to:\n\nM ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3\n\nThe constant factors (2 * π * G) will cancel out when we take the ratio of the two masses.\n\nLet's list the given values for each system:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star 1 (K1a) = 10 km/s\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star 2 (K1b) = 5 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K1_total) = K1a + K1b = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star 1 (K2a) = 15 km/s\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star 2 (K2b) = 10 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K2_total) = K2a + K2b = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2):\n\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1_total)^3] / [P2 * (K2_total)^3]\n\nSubstitute the values into the equation:\n\nM1 / M2 = (2 years * (15 km/s)^3) / (1 year * (25 km/s)^3)\n\nThe units (years and km/s) will cancel out, so we can work with the numerical values:\n\nM1 / M2 = (2 * 15^3) / (1 * 25^3)\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15 / 25)^3\n\nSimplify the fraction 15 / 25:\n15 / 25 = 3 / 5\n\nNow substitute this back into the ratio equation:\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)^3\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\nTo verify the calculation:\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_total = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_total = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the mass ratio M1/M2\n# M1/M2 = (P1 * K1_total^3) / (P2 * K2_total^3)\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * ((K1_total / K2_total)**3)\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculation are as follows:\n\nThe total mass `M` of a double-lined eclipsing binary system is proportional to the orbital period `P` and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (`K1 + K2`). The formula is derived from Kepler's third law and the definition of the mass function. For an eclipsing binary, we can assume the inclination angle `i` is 90°, so sin(i) = 1.\n\nThe relationship is:\nM ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\nLet's denote the parameters for system_1 with a subscript 1 and for system_2 with a subscript 2.\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of RV amplitudes (K1_total) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of RV amplitudes (K2_total) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2):\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1_total)³] / [P2 * (K2_total)³]\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\nM1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4. The Python code execution confirmed this result.\n\n<<<C>>>"
