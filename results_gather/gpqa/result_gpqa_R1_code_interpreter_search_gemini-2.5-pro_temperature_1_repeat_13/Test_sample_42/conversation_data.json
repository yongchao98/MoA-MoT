    "1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:**\n    The first step in naming a polysubstituted benzene ring is to identify the principal functional group, which will determine the parent name and the numbering of the ring. The functional groups present are:\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix: formyl)\n    *   Cyano (-CN, prefix: cyano)\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH, prefix: hydroxy)\n    *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2, prefix: dimethylamino)\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH3, prefix: methoxy)\n\n    According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the priority order for these groups is:\n    Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Nitrile > ... > Hydroxyl > Amino\n\n    Therefore, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the principal functional group. The parent name of the molecule will be **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is assigned position 1.\n\n2.  **Draw and Number the Structure:**\n    Let's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description:\n    *   **Position 1:** Carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **Ortho to -COOH (Positions 2 and 6):** A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are ortho to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Para to -COOH (Position 4):** A methoxy (-OCH3) group is para to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Meta to -COOH (Positions 3 and 5):** A carbaldehyde (-CHO) and a cyano (-CN) group are meta to the carboxylic acid.\n\n    Now, let's use the other positional information to place the substituents unambiguously:\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 4 is also *ortho* to the nitrile (-CN). This means the nitrile must be at position 3 or 5.\n    *   The alcohol (-OH) is also *ortho* to the nitrile (-CN). The alcohol is at position 2 or 6. If the nitrile is at position 3, the alcohol must be at position 2. If the nitrile is at position 5, the alcohol must be at position 6.\n\n    Let's try assigning the nitrile to position 3:\n    *   **Position 1:** -COOH\n    *   **Position 3:** -CN (meta to -COOH, ortho to -OCH3 at 4)\n    *   **Position 4:** -OCH3 (para to -COOH)\n    *   The alcohol (-OH) must be ortho to the nitrile, so it is at **Position 2**. This is consistent with it being ortho to the -COOH.\n    *   The remaining ortho position to -COOH is 6. This must be where the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) goes.\n    *   The remaining meta position is 5. This is where the carbaldehyde (-CHO) must go. This is consistent with it being meta to -COOH.\n\n    So, the substitution pattern is:\n    *   1: -COOH\n    *   2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n3.  **Assemble the IUPAC Name:**\n    Now we list the substituents (other than the principal group) in alphabetical order, preceded by their position numbers.\n    *   Cyano (C)\n    *   Dimethylamino (D)\n    *   Formyl (F)\n    *   Hydroxy (H)\n    *   Methoxy (M)\n\n    Let's assemble the name based on this order and their positions:\n    3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n    *   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\n    *   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n    Our constructed name, \"3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid,\" matches option D perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
