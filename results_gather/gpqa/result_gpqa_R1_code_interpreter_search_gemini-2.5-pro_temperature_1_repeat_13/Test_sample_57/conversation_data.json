    "*   **Analysis of the Options:**\n    *   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is the quantum field theory (QFT) of the strong interaction. Like other QFTs describing fundamental forces (except gravity), it suffers from ultraviolet (UV) divergences in calculations involving loop diagrams (virtual particles). To handle these infinities, a two-step process is used: 1) **Regularization**, where the divergent integrals are mathematically modified to become finite by introducing a parameter (e.g., an energy cutoff), and 2) **Renormalization**, where these infinities are systematically absorbed into a redefinition of the theory's parameters (like mass and coupling constants). Therefore, QCD requires regularization.\n    *   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, while not a quantum theory, has its own high-energy/short-distance problem. The self-energy of a classical point charge is infinite. If you calculate the energy stored in the electric field of an electron modeled as a point, the integral diverges as the distance from the point approaches zero. This is a classical manifestation of a high-energy divergence, indicating the breakdown of the theory at very small scales.\n    *   **D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum field theory of the electromagnetic interaction. It was the first successful renormalizable QFT. Calculations of physical quantities like the Lamb shift or the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron involve divergent loop integrals that must be regularized and then renormalized to produce finite, physically meaningful results. Therefore, QED requires regularization.\n    *   **C) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for string theory is to resolve the problem of UV divergences that plague quantum field theories, especially when trying to incorporate gravity. In string theory, fundamental particles are not point-like but are instead one-dimensional vibrating strings. Interactions are therefore not at a single point in spacetime but are \"smeared out.\" This smearing effectively provides a natural cutoff at the string scale, preventing the short-distance/high-energy divergences from ever appearing in calculations. As a result, scattering amplitudes in superstring theory are believed to be UV-finite to all orders of perturbation theory, and the theory does not require the artificial procedure of regularization.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    QCD, QED, and even Classical Electrodynamics all exhibit divergences at high energies (short distances) that require some form of regularization or indicate a breakdown of the theory. Superstring Theory is specifically constructed in a way that is believed to be free from these ultraviolet divergences, thus not requiring regularization.\n\n<<<C>>>"
