    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Details:** The peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is 1H. Spin-spin coupling is ruled out.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This indicates the presence of two different chemical species in the sample in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Because the chemical shifts are similar, the two species are structurally very similar. Since they are not due to coupling, they must represent two different, but closely related, molecules or conformations that are stable on the NMR timescale.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two clearly defined peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n    *   **Details:** The peaks have equal intensities.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This confirms the presence of two distinct species that can be physically separated by chromatography. The equal intensities corroborate the ~1:1 ratio seen in the NMR. The fact that they can be separated on a standard LC column is a crucial piece of information.\n    *   **Observation:** Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This tells us that the two species are isomers â€“ they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass. This rules out impurities like precursors or side-products with different molecular weights.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Combined Data:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is incorrect. A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight, which would be detected by the mass spectrometer. The data shows both peaks have the *same* mass as the target compound.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.\n        *   **NMR Properties:** Diastereomers are different chemical compounds and are expected to have different NMR spectra. It is very common for corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers to have slightly different chemical shifts, which would result in two peaks, as observed.\n        *   **Chromatographic Properties:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard chromatographic techniques like LC. This is consistent with observing two LC peaks.\n        *   **Mass Properties:** As isomers, they have the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n        *   **Plausible Causes:** This situation could arise in two common ways in peptide synthesis:\n            1.  **Use of a non-enantiomerically pure amino acid:** If one of the chiral amino acids used in the synthesis was a racemic (D/L) mixture, the final product would be a mixture of diastereomers (e.g., L-Ala-L-Phe and L-Ala-D-Phe).\n            2.  **Cis/trans isomerism:** The amide bond, particularly one preceding a proline residue (an X-Pro bond), has restricted rotation and can exist as both *cis* and *trans* isomers. These isomers are a form of diastereomer (specifically, rotational isomers or rotamers) and often exist in significant quantities at room temperature. They interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale, giving two sets of peaks, and are often separable by LC.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This option is fully consistent with all the experimental observations.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is incorrect. A \"double coupled\" product, where an extra amino acid was added, would have a higher molecular weight. This is contradicted by the MS data.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **Properties:** In an achiral environment, enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties. A standard NMR solvent and a standard LC column are both achiral environments. Therefore, a mixture of enantiomers would give only a *single* peak in the NMR spectrum and a *single* peak in the LC trace. To separate them, you would need a chiral reagent or a chiral column.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This option is inconsistent with both the NMR (two peaks) and LC (two peaks) data.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the evidence is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers. They are isomers (same mass), but are distinct molecules that can be distinguished by NMR and separated by LC.\n\n<<<B>>>"
