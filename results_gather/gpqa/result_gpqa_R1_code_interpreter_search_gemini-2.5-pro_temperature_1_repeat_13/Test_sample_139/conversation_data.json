    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This points towards compounds containing isotopes like Deuterium (D), Carbon-13, Nitrogen-15, etc.\n    *   **Clue 2 & 6: Reaction with liquid Y releases B, and B has a melting point near 277 K.** 277 Kelvin is approximately 3.85 °C. The melting point of pure water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier isotope of hydrogen (Deuterium, D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a very strong match. Therefore, substance **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 4 & 5: A precipitate G is formed, which releases B (D₂O) upon heating.** This suggests that G is a deuterated hydrate or hydroxide that decomposes upon heating to release D₂O. For example, a metal hydroxide Al(OH)₃ decomposes to Al₂O₃ and H₂O upon heating. Its deuterated analog, Al(OD)₃, would decompose to Al₂O₃ and D₂O.\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W with an equal number of protons and neutrons.** Since the system clearly involves deuterium, let's consider the reaction of a reactive substance X with liquid Y. If B (D₂O) is released from a product of the reaction, it is likely that the reactant liquid Y is also D₂O. Let's assume **Y is D₂O**. Now, what gas W could be produced?\n        *   Let's check simple gases where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons:\n            *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n            *   Nitrogen gas (N₂): Each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. So, an N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. This fits.\n            *   Carbon monoxide (CO): C has 6p, 6n. O has 8p, 8n. CO has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. This fits.\n        *   A violent reaction of a substance X with D₂O producing D₂ gas is very plausible (e.g., a metal deuteride reacting with heavy water).\n    *   **Clue 7: X and its analog are used in organic chemistry.** This is a crucial clue. We need a reagent, likely containing deuterium.\n    *   **Clue 8: Reaction of a keto acid with X gives a product with 2 oxygen atoms.** A keto acid has the structure R-C(=O)-R'-COOH. It contains a ketone group (1 oxygen) and a carboxylic acid group (2 oxygens), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms. The product having only 2 oxygens implies a reduction reaction where one oxygen atom is removed.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues to Identify X:**\n    *   Let's consider a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry that can be deuterated: **Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Its deuterated analog is **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues.\n    *   **Analog in Organic Chemistry:** LiAlH₄ is a staple reagent. LiAlD₄ is its common deuterated analog used for introducing deuterium atoms. This fits perfectly.\n    *   **Reaction with Y (D₂O):** The reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O is:\n        `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n    *   **Violent Reaction:** This reaction is famously violent and explosive. This fits.\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂. As established, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the `protons = neutrons` condition.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** The products are LiOD (soluble in D₂O) and Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide). Aluminum hydroxide is a gelatinous precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would be the precipitate G. This fits.\n    *   **Heating G:** Heating aluminum hydroxide (or deuteroxide) causes dehydration (or its equivalent): `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. The substance released is D₂O (B), which has a melting point of ~277 K. This fits perfectly.\n    *   **Keto Acid Reaction:** LiAlH₄ (and LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n        *   Ketone: `R-C(=O)-R' → R-CD(OH)-R'` (1 oxygen → 1 oxygen)\n        *   Carboxylic acid: `R'-COOH → R'-CD₂OH` (2 oxygens → 1 oxygen)\n        *   So, a keto acid `R-C(=O)-R'-COOH` (3 oxygens) would be reduced to a diol `R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH` (2 oxygens). The product has 2 oxygen atoms. This final clue also fits perfectly.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest **elements** present in X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (represented by the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The problem states: \"...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   We need to sum the mass of all hydrogen atoms and all aluminum atoms in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule is LiAlD₄.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of D is 2 (1 proton + 1 neutron). Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the most common isotope of Al is 27 (13 protons + 14 neutrons). Total mass = 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Mass from H atoms) + (Mass from Al atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# The problem can be solved through logical deduction, but let's confirm the components.\n# Substance X is identified as LiAlD4.\n# The elements are Li, Al, H.\n# Lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen (H).\n# Heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminum (Al).\n# The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of these elements in the molecule.\n# We will use integer mass numbers (protons + neutrons) as the options are integers.\n\n# Mass number of Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen) = 2\n# Mass number of Aluminum (Al) = 27\n\n# The formula is LiAlD4.\n# Number of Hydrogen (as D) atoms = 4\n# Number of Aluminum atoms = 1\n\n# Cumulative mass from Hydrogen atoms = 4 * 2 = 8\n# Cumulative mass from Aluminum atoms = 1 * 27 = 27\n\n# Total cumulative mass = 8 + 27\ntotal_mass = 8 + 27\nprint(total_mass)\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user's question is a chemical riddle that requires identifying a substance, \"X\", based on a series of clues about its properties and reactions. Once Substance X is identified, a calculation must be performed based on its chemical formula.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue about Melting Point:** The substance B, released from heating a precipitate G, has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains deuterium (D), a heavier isotope of hydrogen, is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clues about the Reaction:**\n    *   Substance X contains a \"heavier isotope\". Since we've identified D₂O, it's highly likely this isotope is Deuterium (D).\n    *   X reacts violently with liquid Y. Given that the system involves deuterium, it's logical to assume that **Y is also D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction produces a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's check potential gases:\n        *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n        *   Nitrogen gas (N₂): Each ¹⁴N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. An N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. This fits.\n        *   Given the context of a reaction with D₂O, the production of D₂ gas is more plausible.\n    *   A precipitate G is formed, and heating G releases B (D₂O). This indicates G is a deuterated hydroxide, M(OD)ₙ, which decomposes upon heating to form a metal oxide and D₂O. For example: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clues from Organic Chemistry:**\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-R'-COOH. It contains 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group, two in the carboxylic acid group). A product with 2 oxygen atoms implies a reduction reaction has occurred, specifically the reduction of the carboxylic acid group to an alcohol (`-COOH → -CH₂OH`), which removes one oxygen atom.\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" We are looking for a powerful reducing agent, capable of reducing carboxylic acids, that has a common deuterated form.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n    *   The premier reducing agent in organic chemistry capable of reducing carboxylic acids is **Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄)**.\n    *   Its \"very close analog\" which incorporates a heavier isotope is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all clues:\n        *   **Reaction with Y (D₂O):** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n        *   **Violent Reaction?** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ (or LiAlD₄) with water (or D₂O) is extremely violent.\n        *   **Gas W?** D₂ is produced, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Fits.\n        *   **Precipitate G?** Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate. Fits.\n        *   **Heating G to get B?** Heating Al(OD)₃ produces Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). Fits.\n        *   **Keto Acid Reaction?** LiAlD₄ reduces the keto acid `R-C(=O)-R'-COOH` (3 oxygens) to the diol `R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH` (2 oxygens). Fits.\n\n    *   All clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1, represented by its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum**.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula unit. We will use the mass number (protons + neutrons) for the calculation.\n        *   Mass of Deuterium (D) = 2 amu.\n        *   Mass of the most common isotope of Aluminum (Al) = 27 amu.\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): There are 4 'D' atoms. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 'Al' atom. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n```python\n# The substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n# The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n# The heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n# The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n# We use the mass number (protons + neutrons) for the calculation.\n\n# Mass number of Deuterium (D): 1 proton + 1 neutron = 2\n# Mass number of Aluminum (Al): 13 protons + 14 neutrons = 27\n\n# In the formula LiAlD4:\n# There are 4 atoms of the lightest element (as D).\n# There is 1 atom of the heaviest element (Al).\n\n# Mass from all Hydrogen atoms = 4 * (mass of D) = 4 * 2 = 8\n# Mass from all Aluminum atoms = 1 * (mass of Al) = 1 * 27 = 27\n\n# Cumulative mass = (Mass from Hydrogen) + (Mass from Aluminum)\ncumulative_mass = 8 + 27\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<C>>>",
