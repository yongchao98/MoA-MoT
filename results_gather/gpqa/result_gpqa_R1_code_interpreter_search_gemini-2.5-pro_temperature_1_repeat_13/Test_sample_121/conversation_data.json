    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O) with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The purpose is the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid, and pyridine acts as a catalyst/base. The bromine will substitute one of the alpha-hydrogens.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide leaving group from the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is the most complex step.\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the carbon alpha to both the nitrile (-CN) and the ester (-COOEt) groups. These protons are acidic due to resonance stabilization of the resulting carbanion.\n    2.  The resulting enolate ion is a nucleophile.\n    3.  The presence of a difunctional electrophile (1,5-dibromopentane) and \"excess\" base suggests a double alkylation reaction. Two molecules of the ethyl cyanoacetate enolate will react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end.\n    *   First, one enolate attacks one end of the dibromopentane:\n        (EtOOC)(NC)CH- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(NC)CH-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    *   Then, a second enolate (formed using the excess NaH) attacks the other end of this intermediate:\n        (EtOOC)(NC)CH- + (EtOOC)(NC)CH-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(NC)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt) + Br-\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is diethyl 2,7-dicyanononanedioate.\n    *   Structure: `EtOOC-CH(CN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CN)-COOEt`\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n1.  **Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two chiral centers at the carbons bearing the cyano groups (C2 and C7 of the nonane chain). This means the product will be a mixture of diastereomers:\n    *   A racemic pair: (2R, 7R) and (2S, 7S).\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 7S), which is identical to (2S, 7R).\n    The NMR spectrum of the final product will be a superposition of the spectra of the racemate and the meso compound.\n\n2.  **Symmetry and Signal Counting for a Single Diastereomer:**\n    *   Let's analyze one of the diastereomers (e.g., the meso form or one enantiomer of the racemate). Both have an element of symmetry (a center of inversion for the meso, a C2 axis for the racemate) that makes the two halves of the molecule chemically equivalent.\n    *   This symmetry means we only need to count the unique protons on one half of the molecule.\n    *   Let's count the distinct proton environments, assuming that geminal protons on a flexible chain are not resolved into separate signals (a common simplification for such problems).\n        *   **Signal 1:** The ethyl -CH3 protons.\n        *   **Signal 2:** The ethyl -OCH2- protons.\n        *   **Signal 3:** The methine -CH(CN) protons.\n        *   **Signal 4:** The -CH2- protons adjacent to the methine group.\n        *   **Signal 5:** The next -CH2- protons in the chain.\n        *   **Signal 6:** The central -CH2- group of the pentane linker, which lies on the element of symmetry.\n    *   This gives a total of **6 distinct signals** for a single diastereomer.\n\n3.  **Signal Counting for the Mixture:**\n    *   The product \"4\" is a mixture of the racemate and the meso compound.\n    *   Diastereomers are different chemical compounds and will have different NMR spectra. Therefore, the signal for each of the 6 proton types in the racemate will have a different chemical shift from the corresponding signal in the meso compound.\n    *   As a result, each of the 6 proton environments will give rise to two distinct signals in the spectrum of the mixture.\n    *   Total number of signals = (Number of signals per diastereomer) × (Number of diastereomers)\n    *   Total number of signals = 6 × 2 = 12.\n\nTherefore, there will be 12 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>"
