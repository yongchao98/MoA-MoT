    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away. The magnitude of this shift in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight. The maximum observed shift, $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n\n    Therefore, we can establish a ratio of the velocity amplitudes of the two stars based on the given wavelength shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} = \\frac{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:** The formula for the radial velocity amplitude $K$ for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{(M_{star} + M_p)^{2/3}} $$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $i$ is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:** The problem provides several key pieces of information that simplify this relationship:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $M_{p1} = M_{p2}$.\n    *   The problem does not specify the orbital inclinations ($i_1$, $i_2$). For a solvable problem of this type, we make the standard assumption that the unknown factors are the same, i.e., $i_1 = i_2$. This implies $\\sin(i_1) = \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n    Under these conditions, all terms in the formula for $K$ are constant for both systems except for the period, $P$. The relationship simplifies to:\n    $$ K \\propto P^{-1/3} $$\n\n4.  **Derive the Period Ratio:** From the proportionality $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can establish a relationship between the ratios of $K$ and $P$.\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n    We need to find the ratio of the orbital periods, $P_2/P_1$. Let's solve for it:\n    First, raise both sides to the power of 3:\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2} $$\n    Now, take the reciprocal of both sides to get the desired ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the known ratio of the velocity amplitudes ($K_1/K_2 = 5/7$) into the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 $$\n\nTo get the numerical value, we perform the calculation:\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio (5/7)^3\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n```output\n0.3644314868804665\n```\nThe result is approximately 0.364. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
