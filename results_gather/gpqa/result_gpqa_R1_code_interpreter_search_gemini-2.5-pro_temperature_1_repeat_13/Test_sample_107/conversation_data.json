    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to compare the magnitude of two distinct energy values related to a Hydrogen atom:\n1.  **The Paramagnetic Coupling Energy (⟨H⟩):** This is the energy shift experienced by an atomic energy level due to the interaction of the electron's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the Zeeman effect.\n2.  **The Transition Energy (ΔE):** This is the energy difference between two atomic energy levels, corresponding to the absorption or emission of a photon with a specific wavelength.\n\n### **2. Calculating the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy (⟨H⟩)**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic interaction (orbital Zeeman effect) is given by:\n$$ H = - \\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B} $$\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic moment of the electron and $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$$ \\vec{\\mu}_L = - \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} $$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the mass of the electron.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian expression, we get:\n$$ H = \\left( \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\right) \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} $$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = B \\hat{k}$. The dot product simplifies to $\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$.\n$$ H = \\left( \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\right) L_z B $$\n\nThe eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. The expectation value of the energy, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$, which represents the energy shift, is therefore:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\left( \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\right) m B $$\n\nThe term in the parenthesis is a fundamental physical constant known as the **Bohr magneton**, $\\mu_B$.\n$$ \\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T} $$\n\nSo, the energy shift is:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\mu_B \\, m \\, B $$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$\n*   $m$ is a \"small value\". For a non-zero effect, we can take the smallest non-zero integer value, $m=1$.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV} $$\n\nThe order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy is $\\approx 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$$ \\Delta E = h f = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\nwhere $h$ is the Planck constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nWe are given:\n*   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$\n\nA convenient formula to calculate the energy in electron-volts (eV) from the wavelength in nanometers (nm) is:\n$$ \\Delta E (\\text{eV}) \\approx \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{\\lambda (\\text{nm})} $$\n\nPlugging in the value of the wavelength:\n$$ \\Delta E \\approx \\frac{1240}{486.1} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV} $$\n\nThe order of magnitude of the transition energy is $\\approx 1 \\, \\text{eV}$.\n(Note: This wavelength corresponds to the Balmer series H-β transition in the Hydrogen atom, from energy level $n=4$ to $n=2$).\n\n### **4. Comparing the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nTo compare them, we can look at their ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $$\n\nThis ratio is a very small number, which means that the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E $$\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe energy splitting due to a typical laboratory magnetic field (like 1 T) is extremely small compared to the energy differences between the principal electronic energy levels of an atom.\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
