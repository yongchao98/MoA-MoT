    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for 1. This matches our calculated DBE of 5.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-), which has 2 protons (n+1 = 2+1 = 3 peaks, a triplet).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (n+1 = 1+1 = 2 peaks, a doublet). This confirms the `-CH2-CHO` fragment, as the CH2 group is coupled to the CHO proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for an amine group (-NH2).\n\n*   **Putting the pieces together:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an amino group (-NH2), and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO). The only way to assemble these fragments is to have the amino group and the acetaldehyde group at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring.\n    The starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    Structure of Starting Material:\n     \n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is the standard set of reagents for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2⁺Cl⁻).\n    The product after this step is **4-(diazoniomethyl)phenylacetaldehyde chloride**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to an aromatic diazonium salt, usually with gentle warming, results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This is a hydrolysis reaction that forms a phenol. Nitrogen gas (N2) is evolved.\n    The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    Structure of Intermediate:\n     \n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat, applied to an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) that possesses α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an α-hydrogen to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product. In this case, the addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option A).\n\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"condensation\" implies the loss of a small molecule, in this case, water. The presence of **heat** strongly favors the dehydration of the initial aldol adduct. A proton is removed from the α-carbon (C2), and the hydroxyl group is eliminated from the β-carbon (C3). This elimination forms a double bond between C2 and C3, resulting in a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The conjugation of the newly formed C=C bond with the C=O group and the adjacent aromatic ring makes this product thermodynamically favored.\n\n    The final product is the dehydrated condensation product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n    Let's trace the formation:\n    1.  **Aldol Adduct (matches Option A):**\n         \n    2.  **Dehydration under heat:**\n         \n    3.  **Final Product (matches Option B):**\n         \n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This intermediate then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. Because the reaction is heated, it proceeds beyond the initial aldol addition product (A) to the final, dehydrated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde (B). Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
