    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2     H\n                   \\   /\n                    C=C\n                   /   \\\n                  H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent is used for epoxidation. The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid is a **syn-addition**, meaning both C-O bonds form on the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent is used for the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction proceeds via an **anti-addition** mechanism, where the nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-hydrolysis) results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:**\n    There's a well-established stereochemical rule for this type of reaction:\n    *   **Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound**\n\n    Let's verify this: The anti-addition of two -OH groups to a trans-alkene creates two chiral centers. For (E)-oct-4-ene, this process yields **meso-octane-4,5-diol**, which is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a single, achiral compound.\n\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** One compound: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is also achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2     CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\   /\n                    C=C\n                   /   \\\n                  H     H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used: mCPBA followed by H3O+. This is again an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:**\n    The stereochemical rule for this case is:\n    *   **Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture**\n\n    Let's verify this: The anti-addition of two -OH groups to a cis-alkene also creates two chiral centers. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, this process yields a mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the chiral products must be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n\n    *   **Products of Reaction 2:** Two compounds that are enantiomers of each other (a racemic pair).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   meso-diol and (4R,5R)-diol are **diastereomers**.\n*   meso-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are also **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of peaks observed on two types of HPLC columns, assuming perfect resolution.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral stationary phase interacts identically with enantiomers. Therefore, it **cannot** separate them. The racemic pair of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will have the same retention time and elute as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties (like polarity, shape, etc.) and will interact differently with the stationary phase. Therefore, an achiral column **can** separate diastereomers. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the (R,R)/(S,S) pair, so it will have a different retention time and elute as a separate peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved racemic pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment. It interacts differently with enantiomers, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different energies. Therefore, a chiral column **can** separate enantiomers. The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   Since a chiral column can also separate diastereomers, the meso-diol will also be separated from the other two isomers. As the meso compound is achiral, it will give only one peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers present in the mixture. It will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-diol, and one for the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
