    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Principle of Mass Dimension in Quantum Field Theory**\n\nIn natural units, where $\\hbar = c = 1$, the action $S$ is dimensionless. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ over four-dimensional spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\n\nThe mass dimension of the spacetime differential element $d^4x$ is $[M]^{-4}$ (since length has dimension $[M]^{-1}$). For the action $S$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of 4.\n$[\\mathcal{L}] = [M]^4$\n\nAny term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n### **2. Determining the Mass Dimensions of the Fields**\n\nWe need to find the mass dimensions of the fermion field $\\psi$ and the field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$. We can deduce these from their standard kinetic terms.\n\n*   **Fermion Field ($\\psi$):**\n    The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{fermion}} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu)\\psi$.\n    For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we must have:\n    $[\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\gamma^\\mu] + [\\partial_\\mu] + [\\psi] = 4$\n    The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless constant matrices, so $[\\gamma^\\mu] = 0$.\n    The derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has a mass dimension of 1, so $[\\partial_\\mu] = 1$.\n    The fermion field and its adjoint have the same mass dimension: $[\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi]$.\n    Substituting these into the equation:\n    $[\\psi] + 0 + 1 + [\\psi] = 4$\n    $2[\\psi] + 1 = 4$\n    $2[\\psi] = 3$\n    $[\\psi] = \\frac{3}{2}$\n    So, the mass dimension of the fermion field $\\psi$ (and $\\bar{\\psi}$) is $3/2$.\n\n*   **Field Strength Tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$):**\n    The kinetic term for a gauge field (like the photon) is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{gauge}} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    For this term to have a mass dimension of 4:\n    $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4$\n    $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4$\n    $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 2$\n    So, the mass dimension of the field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$ is 2.\n\n*   **Sigma Tensor ($\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$):**\n    The tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$. Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless, and $i/2$ is a constant, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless.\n    $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = 0$.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Mass Dimension of $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we analyze the given interaction Lagrangian term:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\n\nThe mass dimension of this term must be 4:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4$\n\nSubstitute the mass dimensions we found for each component:\n$[\\kappa] + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa] + 3 + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa] + 5 = 4$\n$[\\kappa] = -1$\n\nThus, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### **4. Assessing Renormalizability**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the interaction is called **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant is **dimensionless** (mass dimension 0), the interaction is **renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the interaction is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn this case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of -1. Since the mass dimension is negative, the theory described by this interaction term is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nThis type of interaction is what is known as an \"irrelevant operator\" in the language of the Renormalization Group. Higher-order loop corrections in perturbation theory would require an infinite number of counter-terms to cancel all divergences, making the theory lose its predictive power at high energies.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
