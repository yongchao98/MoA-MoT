    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the given metric**\n\nThe line element is given by the metric:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\nThis describes the geometry of a 2-dimensional surface. The metric tensor $g_{ij}$ can be read from this expression. In Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$, the metric tensor is a 2x2 matrix:\n$g_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{xx} & g_{xy} \\\\ g_{yx} & g_{yy} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nComparing with the general form $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + 2g_{xy}dxdy + g_{yy}dy^2$, we can identify the components:\n$g_{xx} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n$g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n$g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\nSo the metric tensor is:\n$g_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**2. Determine the area element**\n\nThe area element $dA$ on a surface with a given metric is calculated using the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor:\n$dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\nLet's calculate the determinant of our metric tensor:\n$\\det(g_{ij}) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right) - 0^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, we find the area element:\n$dA = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2} \\, dx \\, dy = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\nWe take the positive root as the area element must be positive. The denominator $4-x^2-y^2$ is positive in the domain of interest.\n\n**3. Define the domain of integration**\n\nThe problem asks for the area of the \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\". The metric becomes singular when the denominator is zero, i.e., $4 - x^2 - y^2 = 0$, which corresponds to a circle $x^2 + y^2 = 4$. This circle of radius 2 defines the boundary of our space. Therefore, the domain of integration is the open disk $D$ defined by $x^2 + y^2 < 4$.\n\n**4. Set up and calculate the area integral**\n\nThe total area $A$ is the integral of the area element $dA$ over the domain $D$:\n$A = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\nTo evaluate this integral, it's convenient to switch to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where:\n$x = r \\cos\\theta$\n$y = r \\sin\\theta$\n$x^2 + y^2 = r^2$\nThe differential area element in Cartesian coordinates $dx \\, dy$ is replaced by $r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$ in polar coordinates.\n\nThe domain $D$ ($x^2+y^2 < 4$) in polar coordinates is described by:\n$0 \\le r < 2$\n$0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral, we get:\n$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-r^{2}} \\cdot r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$\n\nWe can separate the integrals over $\\theta$ and $r$:\n$A = \\left(\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta\\right) \\left(\\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4-r^{2}} \\, dr\\right)$\n\nThe integral over $\\theta$ is straightforward:\n$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = [\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi$\n\nNow we focus on the integral over $r$. Notice that the integrand $\\frac{32r}{4-r^2}$ is undefined at $r=2$, so this is an improper integral which must be evaluated using a limit:\n$I_r = \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4-r^{2}} \\, dr = \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\int_{0}^{b} \\frac{32r}{4-r^{2}} \\, dr$\n\nWe can solve this integral using a u-substitution. Let $u = 4 - r^2$. Then $du = -2r \\, dr$, which implies $r \\, dr = -\\frac{1}{2} \\, du$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$\\int \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\, du\\right) = -16 \\int \\frac{1}{u} \\, du = -16 \\ln|u| + C = -16 \\ln|4-r^2| + C$\n\nNow we evaluate the definite integral using the limit:\n$I_r = \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\left[ -16 \\ln(4-r^2) \\right]_{0}^{b}$\n$I_r = \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\left( -16 \\ln(4-b^2) - (-16 \\ln(4-0^2)) \\right)$\n$I_r = \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\left( -16 \\ln(4-b^2) + 16 \\ln(4) \\right)$\n$I_r = 16 \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\left( \\ln(4) - \\ln(4-b^2) \\right)$\n$I_r = 16 \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{4-b^2}\\right)$\n\nAs $b$ approaches $2$ from below, the term $4-b^2$ approaches $0$ from the positive side ($0^+$).\nThe fraction $\\frac{4}{4-b^2}$ therefore approaches $+\\infty$.\nThe natural logarithm of a number approaching $+\\infty$ also approaches $+\\infty$.\nSo, $I_r = 16 \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$.\n\n**5. Final conclusion**\n\nThe integral over $r$ diverges to infinity. The total area is:\n$A = 2\\pi \\times I_r = 2\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nThe area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite. This is a characteristic result for such hyperbolic-type geometries where the boundary is at an infinite distance from any interior point, as measured by the metric.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) $+\\infty$\nB) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)$ (Incorrect, area is a number, not a function)\nC) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)$ (Incorrect, area is a number, not a function)\nD) $0$ (Incorrect, the integrand is strictly positive)\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
