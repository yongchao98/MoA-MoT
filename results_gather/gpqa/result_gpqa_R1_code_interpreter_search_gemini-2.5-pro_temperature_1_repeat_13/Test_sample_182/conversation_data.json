    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the reactant's structure and its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its IHD.\n    *   `cyclohex`: This indicates a six-membered carbon ring. A ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `-3-ene`: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. A double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `formyl` (-CHO): This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `vinyl` (-CH=CH2): This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\n    So, the total IHD of the reactant is the sum of contributions from all these features:\n    IHD(reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in COOH) + 1 (C=O in CHO) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n    This corresponds to option A, but the question asks for the IHD of the *product*.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and the effect of the reagents.**\n    The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI). This combination is a very strong reducing agent. Its primary function is to carry out the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and any carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n    *   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to the corresponding alkane parts (i.e., -CH3 groups).\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   Essentially, it removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all pi bonds.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\n    Applying the effects of Red P + HI to our reactant:\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring will be reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C becomes C-C). The ring structure itself remains.\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group will be reduced to a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   The `formyl` group will be reduced to a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl (-CH2-CH3) group.\n\n    The final product will be a saturated substituted cyclohexane. All the double bonds (both C=C and C=O) will be gone. The only feature contributing to the IHD will be the cyclohexane ring itself.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The IHD is defined as the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   Number of rings in the product = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Number of pi bonds in the product = 0 (all double and triple bonds have been reduced to single bonds).\n\n    Therefore, the IHD of the product is:\n    IHD(product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n    Alternatively, we can determine the molecular formula. The reactant has a carbon skeleton of C10 (6 in the ring, 1 in COOH, 1 in CHO, 2 in vinyl). The product, being a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane), will have the general formula CnH2n. Since n=10, the formula is C10H20.\n    Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the IHD of the final product is 1.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 5\nB) 0\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
