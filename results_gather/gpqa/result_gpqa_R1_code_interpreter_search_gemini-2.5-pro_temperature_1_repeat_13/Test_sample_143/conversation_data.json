    "The user has asked for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance ($L$) of the particle in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall Relevant Physical Principles:**\n    *   The mean lifetime of an unstable particle in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, $\\tau$) is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma$). This relationship is given by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   In the laboratory frame, where the particle is moving, its lifetime is longer due to relativistic time dilation. The lab-frame lifetime, $\\tau'$, is given by $\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The mean decay distance ($L$) is the distance the particle travels in the lab frame during its lab-frame lifetime. It is calculated as $L = v \\cdot \\tau'$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation Strategy:**\n    *   First, we combine the equations: $L = v \\cdot \\tau' = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau) = v \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$.\n    *   The term $v\\gamma$ can be more conveniently expressed using the particle's momentum ($p$) and mass ($m$). From the definition of relativistic momentum $p = \\gamma m v$, we can write $v\\gamma = p/m$. To work with energy units (which are given), we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c^2$: $v\\gamma = \\frac{pc^2}{mc^2}$. Actually, it's simpler: $v\\gamma = c \\beta \\gamma$, and $pc = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m c \\beta \\implies \\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{mc^2}$. So, $v\\gamma = c \\frac{pc}{mc^2}$.\n    *   Let's substitute this back into the formula for $L$:\n        $L = \\left(c \\frac{pc}{mc^2}\\right) \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n    *   This formula is very convenient as we are given energies and can use the well-known value of the constant $\\hbar c$ in units of MeV·fm.\n\n4.  **List Given Values and Constants:**\n    *   Total energy: $E_{X} = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Rest mass energy: $m_{X}c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Decay width: $\\Gamma_{X} = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Physical constant: $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (a standard value for this constant)\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculations:**\n    *   **Step a: Calculate the momentum term ($pc$).**\n        Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$:\n        $pc = \\sqrt{E_{X}^2 - (m_{X}c^2)^2}$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{(8000 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (1200 \\text{ MeV})^2}$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} \\text{ MeV}$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    *   **Step b: Substitute all values into the formula for $L$.**\n        $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}} \\times \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n\n    *   **Step c: Use a Python script for a precise calculation.** The script will calculate the value of $L$ and convert it from femtometers (fm) to meters (m), noting that $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values in MeV\nE_X = 8000.0  # Total energy in MeV\nm_X_c2 = 1200.0  # Rest mass energy in MeV\nGamma_X = 320.0  # Decay width in MeV\n\n# Physical constant hbar*c in MeV*fm (CODATA 2018 value)\nhbar_c = 197.3269804\n\n# Calculate pc = sqrt(E^2 - (mc^2)^2)\npc = math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X_c2**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay distance L in femtometers (fm)\n# L = (pc / m_X_c2) * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\nL_fm = (pc / m_X_c2) * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\n\n# Convert the result from femtometers (fm) to meters (m)\n# 1 fm = 10^-15 m\nL_m = L_fm * 1e-15\n\nprint(L_m)\n```\n```output\n4.0644671309483915e-15\n```\n6.  **Final Analysis and Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated value is $L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n    *   Let's compare this to the given options:\n        A) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n        B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n        C) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n        D) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n    *   The calculated result is extremely close to option B.
