    "1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let's break down the name to draw its structure.\n    *   \"nona\": A 9-carbon parent chain.\n    *   \"diene\": There are two double bonds.\n    *   \"2,6-\": The double bonds start at carbons 2 and 6. So, C2=C3 and C6=C7.\n    *   \"5-butyl\": A butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n\n    The structure is:\n    CH₃(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(5)(C₄H₉)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₃(9)\n\n    Let's verify the total number of atoms.\n    *   Carbons: 9 from the nonane chain + 4 from the butyl group = 13 carbons.\n    *   The molecular formula for an acyclic diene is CₙH₂ₙ₋₂. For n=13, the formula is C₁₃H₂₄.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Conditions:**\n    The molecule is heated. The structure `C=C-C-C-C=C` (specifically C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7) is a 1,5-diene system. Heating a 1,5-diene is the classic condition for a **Cope rearrangement**, which is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.\n\n3.  **Perform the Cope Rearrangement:**\n    The Cope rearrangement involves the breaking of the sigma bond between carbons 3 and 4 of the [3,3] system and the formation of a new sigma bond between carbons 1 and 6, with a corresponding shift of the two pi bonds.\n\n    Let's number the atoms of the 1,5-diene system for clarity of the mechanism:\n    *   `c1` = C2 (of the IUPAC chain)\n    *   `c2` = C3\n    *   `c3` = C4\n    *   `c4` = C5\n    *   `c5` = C6\n    *   `c6` = C7\n\n    The rearrangement proceeds as follows:\n    *   **Bond breaks:** The sigma bond between `c3` and `c4` (which is the C4-C5 bond) breaks.\n    *   **Bond forms:** A new sigma bond forms between `c1` and `c6` (the C2-C7 bond).\n    *   **Pi bonds shift:** The double bond from `c1=c2` moves to `c2=c3` (i.e., C2=C3 becomes C3=C4). The double bond from `c5=c6` moves to `c4=c5` (i.e., C6=C7 becomes C5=C6).\n\n4.  **Determine the Product Structure:**\n    Let's trace the connectivity of the atoms in the product. It's helpful to think of the molecule splitting into two allylic fragments at the breaking C4-C5 bond and then rejoining at the new C2-C7 bond.\n\n    *   **Fragment 1 (from C1 to C4):** `CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-`. After the rearrangement, this becomes `CH₃-CH-CH=CH₂`, with a connection point at the original C2.\n    *   **Fragment 2 (from C5 to C9 plus the butyl group):** `-(C₄H₉)CH-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃`. After the rearrangement, this becomes `-(C₄H₉)CH=CH-CH-CH₂CH₃`, with a connection point at the original C7.\n\n    Now, let's connect these two fragments by forming a bond between the original C2 and C7.\n    `CH₃-CH - CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH=CH-C₄H₉`\n          |\n         `CH=CH₂`\n\n    Let's write this out as a single linear structure to make it easier to name:\n    `CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃`\n\n5.  **Name the Product:**\n    *   **Find the parent chain:** We need to find the longest continuous carbon chain that contains both double bonds.\n        The chain is `CH₂(1)=CH(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH(5)=CH(6)-CH₂(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₂(9)-CH₃(10)`.\n        This is a 10-carbon chain, so the parent name is \"deca\".\n    *   **Number the chain:** We number the chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants.\n        - Numbering from the left gives the double bonds at positions 1 and 5 (`deca-1,5-diene`).\n        - Numbering from the right would give positions 5 and 9 (`deca-5,9-diene`).\n        The lowest locant set is 1,5, so we number from the left.\n    *   **Identify and name substituents:**\n        - There is a methyl group (-CH₃) on carbon 3.\n        - There is an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) on carbon 4.\n    *   **Assemble the full IUPAC name:** Following the alphabetical order for substituents, the name is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    *   B) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n    *   C) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n    *   D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene (duplicate of A)\n\n    Our derived name, `4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene`, matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
