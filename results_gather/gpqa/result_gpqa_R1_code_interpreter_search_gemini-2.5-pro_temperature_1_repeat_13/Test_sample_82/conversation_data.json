    "This problem involves a titration of a weak acid (acetic acid, CH3COOH) with a strong base (NaOH). We need to calculate the pH at two specific points: at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial conditions after dilution.**\nFirst, the 0.05 M acetic acid solution is diluted.\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (HA):\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol\n*   The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.0200 L).\n*   It is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   The new total volume of the acid solution is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L).\n*   The concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution is:\n    Concentration (C_a) = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa).\nThe reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H₂O\n*   This means 25% of the acid is converted to its conjugate base (A⁻), and 75% remains as the acid (HA).\n*   The solution now contains a mixture of a weak acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate base (CH3COO⁻), which forms a buffer.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵)\n*   The ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base to the acid, [A⁻]/[HA], is equal to the ratio of their moles. At 25% titration, this ratio is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.256\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH3COONa).\n*   First, determine the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point (V_eq).\n    Moles of acid = Moles of base\n    (C_a × V_a) = (C_b × V_eq)\n    0.001 mol = 0.1 mol/L × V_eq\n    V_eq = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is the initial volume of the diluted acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n    V_total = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   The moles of acetate (A⁻) formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion [A⁻] at the equivalence point is:\n    [A⁻] = Moles / V_total = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water:\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion, which can be calculated from Ka and Kw (the ion product of water, 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C):\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can simplify:\n    5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² ≈ 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Now, calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. This matches option D.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05  # M\ninitial_vol_acid = 0.020  # L\ndilution_vol = 0.020 # L\nconc_base = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution ---\nmoles_acid = initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid\nfinal_vol_acid = initial_vol_acid + dilution_vol\nconc_acid_diluted = moles_acid / final_vol_acid\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% titration ---\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at equivalence point ---\n# Moles of base needed = initial moles of acid\nvol_base_eq = moles_acid / conc_base\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq = final_vol_acid + vol_base_eq\n# Concentration of conjugate base at equivalence point\nconc_A_minus = moles_acid / total_vol_eq\n# Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# [OH-]^2 / [A-] = Kb  => [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\n# We assume [A-] - x is approx [A-]\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus)\n# pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_at_eq = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_eq:.2f}\")\n\n```\n<execute_return>\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n</execute_return>\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a weak acid-strong base titration problem. We need to calculate the pH at two points: 25% of the way to the equivalence point and at the equivalence point itself.\n\n### **Step 1: Initial State after Dilution**\n\nFirst, the acetic acid solution is diluted. We calculate the new concentration.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    Moles = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol\n\n*   **New volume after adding water:**\n    Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n\n*   **Concentration of the diluted acetic acid:**\n    Concentration = Moles / New Volume\n    Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n### **Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base (acetate, CH₃COO⁻) by the NaOH, and 75% of the acetic acid remains. This creates a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**\n    pH = pKₐ + log( [A⁻] / [HA] )\n    where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\n\n*   **Calculate pKₐ:**\n    pKₐ = -log(Kₐ) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n*   **Determine the ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    At 25% titration, the ratio of moles of A⁻ to HA is 25:75, which simplifies to 1:3.\n    So, [A⁻] / [HA] = 1/3.\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.256\n    Rounding to two decimal places gives **pH = 4.26**.\n\n### **Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the weak base, acetate. The pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH needed:**\n    Moles of acid = Moles of base\n    0.001 mol = (0.1 mol/L) × Volume of NaOH\n    Volume of NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Total volume at the equivalence point:**\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([A⁻]):**\n    The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid (0.001 mol).\n    [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n*   **Hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    The acetate ion acts as a base, producing OH⁻ ions. We need to calculate the concentration of OH⁻.\n\n*   **Calculate Kₑ:**\n    Kₑ = Kₙ / Kₐ = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻]:**\n    Kₑ = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n    5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kₑ is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    x² ≈ (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n    Rounding to two decimal places gives **pH = 8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<D>>>"
