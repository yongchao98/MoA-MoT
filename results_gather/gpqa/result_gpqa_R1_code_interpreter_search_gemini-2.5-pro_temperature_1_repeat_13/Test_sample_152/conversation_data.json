    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, `CH2(COOCH3)2`. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-hydrogen between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `[CH(COOCH3)2]^-`. This is the nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH3`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon atom attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative.\n    *   The electrons from the C=C double bond shift to form another enolate intermediate, which is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to give the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Draw the Product Structure:**\n    *   The `CH(COOCH3)2` group (from the donor) forms a new bond with the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The original α-carbon of the acceptor gains a proton.\n    *   Donor fragment: `-CH(COOCH3)2`\n    *   Acceptor fragment: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)-CH(α)H-COOCH3`\n    *   Product (A): `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH2-COOCH3`\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):**\n    *   We need to find the correct IUPAC name for the structure `(MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH2-COOMe`.\n    *   Let's analyze the names given in the options.\n        *   `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate`: This name implies the structure `p-Tolyl-CH2-CH(COOMe)-CH(COOMe)2`. This would result from an attack on the α-carbon, which is incorrect for a Michael addition.\n        *   `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`: This name implies a propane chain (C1-C2-C3). Carboxylate groups are at positions 1, 1, and 3. A p-tolyl group is at position 2. Let's build this structure: `(MeOOC)2CH(C1)-CH(p-Tolyl)(C2)-CH2(C3)-COOMe`. This structure matches the product derived from the Michael addition.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which is a variation of the Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor (as enamine):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the α-carbon.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile, `CH3-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion and a carbanion, which is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    *   Finally, the acidic workup (`H3O+`) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a ketone.\n\n3.  **Draw the Product Structure:**\n    *   The net result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The group added is derived from the acceptor, `CH3-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The new bond is between C2 of the ketone and Cβ of the nitrile. Cα of the nitrile gets a proton.\n    *   The added fragment is `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with the `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN` group attached at the C2 position.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (B):**\n    *   The structure is 2-(1-methyl-2-cyanoethyl)cyclohexanone.\n    *   Let's check the names in the options.\n        *   `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`: This is the enol tautomer of the product.\n        *   `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`: This names the compound by treating the butanenitrile as the parent chain. The substituent at position 3 is the (2-oxocyclohexyl) group. This accurately describes the keto form of the product.\n    *   The keto form is generally the more stable and major product after an acidic workup that hydrolyzes the intermediate.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to find the Michael donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, `CH2=CH-CO-CH3`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structures (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   The Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   Let's identify the fragment that came from the acceptor. The acceptor is `CH2(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH3`. After reaction, it becomes the `-CH2(β)-CH2(α)-CO-CH3` group, which is a `(3-oxobutyl)` group.\n    *   The product shows this `(3-oxobutyl)` group attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring system.\n    *   This means the bond was formed between C2 of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   Therefore, the donor must have been the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The starting material (C) that forms this enolate upon treatment with base (KOH) is the dione itself.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   The methylene protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups. They are readily removed by KOH to form the nucleophilic enolate required for the Michael addition.\n    *   The alternative option, `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`, is the enol tautomer. While the enolate is the reactive species, the starting material is typically written as the diketone.\n    *   Therefore, **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nThese results correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
