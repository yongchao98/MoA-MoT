    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu). We can solve this by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\n`Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n\n**Given:**\n*   Rest mass of Pi+ (`m_pi * c^2`) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of mu+ (`m_mu * c^2`) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The initial Pi+ is stationary.\n*   The muon neutrino (nu) is considered to be massless (`m_nu * c^2` = 0).\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (`E_initial`):** Since the Pi+ is stationary, its total energy is its rest mass energy.\n    `E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n\n*   **Final Energy (`E_final`):** The final state consists of a muon and a neutrino, both of which are moving and thus have kinetic energy.\n    `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n    where `E_mu` is the total energy of the muon and `E_nu` is the total energy of the neutrino.\n    The total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy (KE):\n    `E_mu = m_mu * c^2 + KE_mu`\n    `E_nu = m_nu * c^2 + KE_nu`\n\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its rest mass energy is zero, so `E_nu = KE_nu`.\n\n*   **Applying Conservation:**\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `m_pi * c^2 = (m_mu * c^2 + KE_mu) + KE_nu`\n    The total kinetic energy released in the decay (also known as the Q-value) is:\n    `KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2`\n    `KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n*   **Initial Momentum (`p_initial`):** The Pi+ is stationary, so its momentum is zero.\n    `p_initial = 0`\n\n*   **Final Momentum (`p_final`):** The final momentum is the vector sum of the muon's momentum (`p_mu`) and the neutrino's momentum (`p_nu`).\n    `p_final = p_mu + p_nu`\n\n*   **Applying Conservation:**\n    `p_initial = p_final`\n    `0 = p_mu + p_nu`\n    This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude. Let `p` be the magnitude of their momentum:\n    `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n**3. Combining the Equations to Find the Energies:**\nWe can relate a particle's total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest mass (`m`) with the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n\n*   **For the massless neutrino:**\n    `E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + 0`\n    `E_nu = p*c`\n    So, `KE_nu = E_nu = p*c`\n\n*   **For the muon:**\n    `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nNow we have a system of equations. We can solve for the unknown energies.\nFrom the energy conservation equation:\n`E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu`\n\nSubstitute `E_nu = p*c`:\n`E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - p*c`\n\nNow substitute this expression for `E_mu` into the muon's energy-momentum relation:\n`(m_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nExpand the left side:\n`(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nThe `(p*c)^2` terms on both sides cancel out. Rearrange to solve for `p*c`:\n`2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n`p*c = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2*(m_pi*c^2) ]`\n\nNow, let's compute the value of `p*c`, which is also the kinetic energy of the neutrino (`KE_nu`).\n```python\nm_pi = 139.6  # MeV/c^2\nm_mu = 105.7  # MeV/c^2\n\n# Calculate p*c, which is the energy of the neutrino\npc = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The total energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt((pc)^2 + m_mu^2)\nE_mu = (pc**2 + m_mu**2)**0.5\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# Or using energy conservation:\n# Total KE = m_pi - m_mu\n# KE_mu = Total KE - KE_nu\nKE_mu_alt = (m_pi - m_mu) - KE_nu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (MeV): {KE_mu:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (MeV): {KE_nu:.2f}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\nKE of muon (MeV): 4.12\nKE of neutrino (MeV): 29.78\n</execute_output>\nThe calculations give:\n*   Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (`KE_nu`) ≈ 29.8 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of the muon (`KE_mu`) ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\nThe pair of kinetic energies is approximately (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV). This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu). We can solve this using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy of the system is the rest energy of the stationary pion. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n*   Initial Energy (`E_initial`) = `m_pi * c^2`\n*   Final Energy (`E_final`) = `E_mu + E_nu`\n    *   `E_mu` = Total energy of the muon = `m_mu * c^2 + KE_mu`\n    *   `E_nu` = Total energy of the neutrino = `KE_nu` (since the neutrino is considered massless)\n\nFrom conservation of energy:\n`m_pi * c^2 = (m_mu * c^2 + KE_mu) + KE_nu`\n`KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2`\n`KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial momentum is zero since the pion is at rest. Therefore, the final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum (`p`).\n*   `p_mu = p`\n*   `p_nu = p`\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nWe use the equation `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\n*   For the massless neutrino: `E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + 0`, which simplifies to `E_nu = p*c`.\n*   For the muon: `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`.\n\n**4. Solving for the Energies:**\nWe can substitute `p*c = E_nu` into the muon's energy equation:\n`E_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nFrom the energy conservation equation, we have `E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu`. Substituting this into the above equation:\n`(m_pi * c^2 - E_nu)^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nExpanding the left side:\n`(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*E_nu + E_nu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nThe `E_nu^2` terms cancel. Now, we solve for `E_nu`, which is the kinetic energy of the neutrino (`KE_nu`):\n`2*(m_pi*c^2)*E_nu = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n`KE_nu = E_nu = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2*(m_pi*c^2) ]`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n`KE_nu = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n`KE_nu = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n`KE_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n\nNow we can find the kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_mu`) using the total kinetic energy calculated earlier:\n`KE_mu = 33.9 MeV - KE_nu`\n`KE_mu = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. These values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
