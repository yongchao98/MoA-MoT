    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 3: Hydrolysis of C**\n    *   The reaction is `C + H₂O -> A + F(acid) + G(acid)`.\n    *   `F` is a strong acid, and `G` is a weak acid.\n    *   This is a hydrolysis reaction where the starting material `A` is reformed. This suggests that `A` is an element, and `C` is a compound of `A` with other groups that hydrolyze to form the two acids.\n    *   The groups that form acids must come from reactant `B` (from Reaction 1: `A + 8B -> C`). So, the hydrolysis of a single substance `B` must yield a strong acid and a weak acid.\n    *   Let's evaluate possible candidates for gas `B`:\n        *   `B = COCl₂` (phosgene): Hydrolysis is `COCl₂ + 2H₂O -> H₂CO₃ (weak acid, G) + 2HCl (strong acid, F)`. This is a perfect match.\n        *   `B = NOCl` (nitrosyl chloride): Hydrolysis is `NOCl + H₂O -> HNO₂ (weak acid, G) + HCl (strong acid, F)`. This is also a good match.\n        *   `B = PCl₃` (phosphorus trichloride): `PCl₃` is a liquid at STP (b.p. 76°C), but could be a gas if heated. Hydrolysis is `PCl₃ + 3H₂O -> H₃PO₃ (weak acid, G) + 3HCl (strong acid, F)`. This is a possible match.\n        *   `B = ClCN` (cyanogen chloride): Hydrolysis is `ClCN + H₂O -> HOCN (weak acid, G) + HCl (strong acid, F)`. This is a possible match.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 4: Formation of Solvent H**\n    *   The reaction is `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent)` in a `1:1` ratio. This is a very strong clue.\n    *   Let's test our candidates for `B`:\n        *   If `B = COCl₂`, we need a gas `D` that reacts with it 1:1 to form a solvent `H`. A known reaction is with sulfur trioxide (`SO₃`): `COCl₂ + SO₃ -> SO₂Cl₂ + CO₂`.\n            *   `D = SO₃` (sulfur trioxide, gas above 45°C).\n            *   `H = SO₂Cl₂` (sulfuryl chloride), which is a liquid solvent.\n            *   The reaction produces `H` (and a byproduct `CO₂`), and the reactant stoichiometry is 1:1. This is a very strong candidate.\n        *   If `B = NOCl`, `PCl₃`, or `ClCN`, finding a simple 1:1 gas-phase reaction that produces a common solvent is difficult. The `COCl₂`/`SO₃` pair is chemically the most plausible.\n\n3.  **Identify the Key Reactants and Products**\n    *   Based on the analysis so far, the most likely identities are:\n        *   `B` = `COCl₂` (Phosgene)\n        *   `F` = `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid)\n        *   `G` = `H₂CO₃` (Carbonic acid)\n        *   `D` = `SO₃` (Sulfur trioxide)\n        *   `H` = `SO₂Cl₂` (Sulfuryl chloride)\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2: Formation of Hazardous Product E**\n    *   The reaction is `C + 2D -> E`.\n    *   Substituting our identified `D`, we get: `C + 2SO₃ -> E`.\n    *   We know `C` is a \"bright red product\" formed from `A(s) + 8COCl₂(g)`. So, `C` contains element `A` and atoms from phosgene (C, O, Cl).\n    *   Therefore, `E` must be formed from the elements {A, C, O, Cl, S}.\n    *   `E` is described as \"extremely hazardous\".\n\n5.  **Determine the Identity and Symmetry of E**\n    *   The overall chemical system involves phosgene (`COCl₂`), sulfur trioxide (`SO₃`), and sulfuryl chloride (`SO₂Cl₂`). These are all hazardous, reactive inorganic compounds.\n    *   The most likely \"extremely hazardous\" products (`E`) in this context would be simple, volatile molecules made from the available elements.\n    *   Let's consider the simplest and most hazardous possibilities:\n        *   **Phosgene (`COCl₂`)**: It is extremely hazardous. It is already present as reactant `B`. It's possible that the reaction `C + 2SO₃ -> E` regenerates phosgene, perhaps by `SO₃` displacing it from the complex `C`.\n        *   **Sulfuryl Chloride (`SO₂Cl₂`)**: It is hazardous and corrosive. It is already identified as the solvent `H`. It's unlikely that `E` and `H` are the same, given the different formation reactions (`C+2D` vs `D+B`).\n        *   **Thiophosgene (`CSCl₂`)**: Extremely hazardous, but requires sulfur to replace oxygen in `COCl₂`. The reaction `C + 2SO₃` is an oxidation/sulfonation, not a thionation.\n\n    *   The most plausible scenario is that `E` is phosgene (`COCl₂`). The reaction `C + 2SO₃ -> COCl₂` would be a displacement, where `SO₃` replaces `COCl₂` ligands on the central element `A`. While the exact nature of `A` and `C` remains unknown (it's a very difficult part of the puzzle, likely involving an obscure reaction), identifying `E` is possible based on the context.\n\n    *   **Symmetry of Phosgene (`COCl₂`)**:\n        *   The molecule is planar.\n        *   There is a C₂ rotation axis that passes through the carbon and oxygen atoms.\n        *   There are two mirror planes (σᵥ):\n            1.  The plane containing all the atoms (`O, C, Cl, Cl`).\n            2.  The plane perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the `C=O` bond.\n        *   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes containing the axis belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n    *   This matches option A.\n\nFinal Check: The proposed set of compounds (A=unknown, B=COCl₂, C=A(COCl₂)₈-type complex, D=SO₃, E=COCl₂, F=HCl, G=H₂CO₃, H=SO₂Cl₂) is consistent with all the reaction descriptions, even if the exact structure of C is elusive. The identification of E as COCl₂ leads directly to the C₂ᵥ point group.\n\n<<<A>>>"
