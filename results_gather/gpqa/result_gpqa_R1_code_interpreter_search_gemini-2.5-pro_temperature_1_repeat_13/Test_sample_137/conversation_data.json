    "*   **Analysis of the initial conditions:** The reaction produces a product containing H+ ions, or is catalyzed by H+ ions. It is proceeding at pH 1. The pH is a measure of the concentration of H+ ions in a solution, defined as pH = -log[H+]. A pH of 1 corresponds to an H+ concentration of 10⁻¹ M.\n\n*   **Analysis of the changes after the accident:**\n    1.  **An unknown substance was added:** This substance interacts with the reaction mixture.\n    2.  **The rate of reaction became slower:** This is the key effect we need to explain.\n    3.  **The container got hot (exothermic reaction):** This means the temperature of the solution increased. According to chemical kinetics (Arrhenius equation), an increase in temperature generally *increases* the rate of reaction by providing more kinetic energy to the reacting molecules. Since the observed effect is a *slower* rate, the temperature increase must be a side effect, and another, more dominant factor must be causing the slowdown. Therefore, option (A) is unlikely to be the reason for the slowing.\n    4.  **The pH changed to 4:** A pH of 4 corresponds to an H+ concentration of 10⁻⁴ M.\n\n*   **Connecting the changes to the reaction rate:**\n    *   The pH increased from 1 to 4. This means the concentration of H+ ions [H+] *decreased* from 10⁻¹ M to 10⁻⁴ M, which is a 1000-fold decrease.\n    *   The problem states the reaction involves H+ ions. It's common for reaction rates to depend on the concentration of reactants or catalysts. The rate law for the reaction would likely include the concentration of H+ (Rate ∝ [H+]^n).\n    *   Since the concentration of H+ decreased significantly, it is highly probable that the reaction rate slowed down because a key reactant or catalyst (H+) was depleted. The unknown substance was likely a base that neutralized the H+ ions, causing both the pH to rise and the container to get hot (neutralization reactions are typically exothermic).\n\n*   **Evaluating the other options:**\n    *   **B) The increased pressure of the solution:** Pressure is primarily a factor for reactions involving gases. There is no information to suggest this is relevant.\n    *   **D) The increased volume of the solution:** While adding the substance would increase the volume and thus dilute all reactants (which could slow the rate), the change in pH is a much more specific and dramatic effect (a 1000-fold decrease in [H+]) that directly explains the slowdown, given the nature of the reaction. The pH change is the most direct and significant factor mentioned.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The most direct and compelling reason for the decrease in the reaction rate is the increase in pH, which signifies a drastic reduction in the concentration of the H+ ions required for the reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
