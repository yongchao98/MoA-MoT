    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Premise:** The problem assumes a uniform spatial distribution of stars. This means the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant number density `ρ`.\n\n2.  **Relating Distance and Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is given by:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n\n3.  **Counting Stars in a Volume:** We want to find the number of stars (`N`) within a certain volume of space. For a uniform distribution, the number of stars in a given volume (`V`) is simply the volume multiplied by the number density:\n    `N = ρ * V`\n\n4.  **Focusing on a Specific Parallax Range:** The question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*. This means we need to find how many stars are found in a small interval of parallax, from `plx` to `plx + d(plx)`. This parallax interval corresponds to a specific range of distances.\n\n5.  **Defining the Volume Element:** A small range of parallax `d(plx)` corresponds to a small range of distance `dd`. The stars within this distance range `dd` at a distance `d` will occupy a thin spherical shell.\n    *   The volume of a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd` is given by its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4 * π * d² * dd`.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Number of Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars (`dN`) in this thin shell is the volume of the shell (`dV`) multiplied by the constant star density (`ρ`):\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4 * π * d² * dd)`\n\n7.  **Expressing the Relationship in Terms of Parallax:** Now, we need to convert our expression from being in terms of distance (`d` and `dd`) to being in terms of parallax (`plx` and `d(plx)`).\n    *   We know `d = 1 / plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1/plx) = -1 / plx²`\n    *   So, `dd = - (1 / plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign just indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, so we can take the absolute value: `|dd| = (1 / plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n8.  **Substitution and Simplification:** Let's substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)² * (1 / plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1 / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n9.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4 * π * (1 / plx⁴)`\n\n10. **Final Conclusion:** Since `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants, we can see the relationship:\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN / d(plx)`) is proportional to `1 / plx⁴`.\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is `~ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
