    "*   **1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n    *   **CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n        *   Moles = Volume × Molarity = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n    *   **HCl (strong acid):**\n        *   Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol HCl\n        *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 mol of H+ ions.\n    *   **Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n        *   Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2\n        *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-), the moles of OH- are:\n        *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol OH-\n\n*   **2. Neutralization Reactions.**\n    The acids and bases will neutralize each other. The strong acid (H+) will react with the strong base (OH-) first.\n\n    *   **Step 2a: Strong Acid-Strong Base Reaction**\n        *   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n        *   Initial moles H+ = 0.080 mol\n        *   Initial moles OH- = 0.180 mol\n        *   H+ is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n        *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n    *   **Step 2b: Weak Acid-Strong Base Reaction**\n        Now, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n        *   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n        *   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n        *   Moles of OH- (from Step 2a) = 0.100 mol\n        *   CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n        *   Moles of excess OH- = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **3. Calculate the pH of the final solution.**\n    The final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess strong base (OH-). This excess OH- will determine the pH of the solution. The presence of the weak conjugate base (CH3COO-) will have a negligible effect on the pH compared to the strong base.\n\n    *   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n    *   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n        *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n        *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = 0.04167 M\n\n    *   **Calculate the pOH:**\n        *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n        *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n    *   **Calculate the pH:**\n        *   pH + pOH = 14\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH\n        *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
