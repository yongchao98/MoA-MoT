    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Concept:** The question asks about the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The key phrase is that nucleons in a nucleus \"behave in the same way as free nucleons\" during an interaction. What does this imply?\n    *   \"Free nucleon\" means the nucleon is not interacting with anything else.\n    *   \"In a nucleus\" means the nucleon is, in fact, surrounded by and interacting with other nucleons (protons and neutrons) via the strong nuclear force (binding energy).\n    *   The \"approximation\" must therefore involve ignoring these interactions with other nucleons at the moment of the primary interaction with the external probe (e.g., an electron or neutrino).\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Statement in Light of the Core Concept:**\n\n    *   **Statement 1: \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n        *   **Reasoning:** If the interaction happened with multiple nucleons at once (e.g., via meson-exchange currents) or with the nucleus as a whole, you couldn't possibly treat the interaction as happening with a \"free\" nucleon. The very first step of the impulse approximation is to assume the external probe singles out just one nucleon. This statement is fundamental. It's the \"single nucleon\" part of the approximation.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Statement 1 is essential.\n\n    *   **Statement 2: \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n        *   **Reasoning:** What happens after the probe hits the nucleon? The struck nucleon, and possibly the scattered probe, must exit the nucleus. If they interact with other nucleons on their way out (a process called \"Final State Interactions\" or FSI), their final energy and momentum will be changed. This is not what would happen to a truly free nucleon in a vacuum. To make the analogy to a free nucleon hold, we must assume these subsequent interactions don't happen. In other words, the rest of the nucleus is \"transparent\" to the outgoing particles.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Statement 2 is essential. It ensures the *outcome* of the interaction resembles a free-particle interaction.\n\n    *   **Statement 3: \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n        *   **Reasoning:** This statement deals with the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself (i.e., its composition from quarks). The impulse approximation is about the nucleon's behavior *within the nuclear medium*. While we need a model for the nucleon to calculate the interaction (e.g., using form factors that depend on its quark structure), the impulse approximation itself doesn't mandate a specific model. We could use a relativistic or non-relativistic quark model, or even treat the nucleon as a point-like particle with certain properties. The approximation is about ignoring the influence of *other nucleons*, not about the internal dynamics of the *selected nucleon*.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Statement 3 is not a necessary assumption for the impulse approximation. It's an assumption for a different level of modeling (the nucleon's structure).\n\n    *   **Statement 4: \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n        *   **Reasoning:** This is the \"impulse\" part of the name. The idea is that the interaction with the external probe is very fastâ€”like a sudden \"impulse.\" It happens over such a short timescale that the relatively slow-acting binding forces from the other nucleons don't have time to act or change the nucleon's state *during* the interaction. The nucleon is effectively \"frozen\" in its state for the duration of the hit, and its binding to the nucleus is ignored at that instant. We can therefore use the properties of a free nucleon (like its mass and form factors) for the interaction itself.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Statement 4 is essential. It's the core of treating the nucleon as \"free\" *at the moment of interaction*.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Results:**\n    *   We have identified statements 1, 2, and 4 as essential components of the impulse approximation.\n    *   Statement 1: The interaction is with one nucleon.\n    *   Statement 4: During this interaction, the nucleon is treated as free (binding forces ignored).\n    *   Statement 2: After this interaction, the products escape without further interaction (nucleus is transparent).\n    *   Statement 3 is about a different physical regime (sub-nucleon structure) and is not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation itself.\n\n4.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2, 3, 4 - Incorrect, includes 3.\n    *   B) 1, 3, 4 - Incorrect, includes 3.\n    *   C) 1, 2, 3 - Incorrect, includes 3.\n    *   D) 1, 2, 4 - Correct, includes all the essential statements and excludes the irrelevant one.\n\n<<<D>>>"
