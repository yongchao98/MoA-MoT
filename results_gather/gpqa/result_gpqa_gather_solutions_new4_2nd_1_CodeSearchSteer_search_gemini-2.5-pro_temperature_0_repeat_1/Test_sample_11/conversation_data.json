Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem describes a two-body decay of a stationary particle. The solution relies on two fundamental conservation laws from physics:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is stationary, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the product particles must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay (the rest energy of the pion) must equal the total energy after the decay (the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino). Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their total energy is a sum of their kinetic energy and their rest mass energy.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information and Assumptions**\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+) ($m_{\\pi}$): 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+) ($m_{\\mu}$): 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The pion is stationary.\n*   The neutrino is assumed to be massless ($m_{\\nu} = 0$). This is a standard and valid approximation for this problem.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nLet `p` be the magnitude of the momentum of both the muon and the neutrino.\nLet `KE` be the kinetic energy.\n\n*   From the conservation of energy:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = (KE_{\\mu} + m_{\\mu}c^2) + KE_{\\nu}$\n\n*   The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is:\n    $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$:\n    *   For the massless neutrino, its total energy is purely kinetic: $E_{\\nu} = pc = KE_{\\nu}$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$.\n\n*   We can now solve for the unknown energies. A common method is to first find the energy of the neutrino:\n    $E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n    $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}$\n    $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2}$\n    $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   Now, find the kinetic energy of the muon using the total kinetic energy:\n    $KE_{\\mu} = KE_{total} - KE_{\\nu}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 33.9 - 29.78 \\approx 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4.

We can solve for `pc`, which is the energy (and kinetic energy) of the neutrino.\n    *   Rearrange the energy equation: `m_πc² - pc = sqrt((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)`.\n    *   Square both sides to eliminate the square root: `(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`.\n    *   Expand the left side: `(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`.\n    *   The `(pc)²` term cancels out. Now, solve for `pc`:\n        `pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Values:**\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n        Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is its total energy, `KE_ν = E_ν = pc`.\n        `KE_ν = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]`\n        `KE_ν = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2`\n        `KE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV`.\n        Rounding gives **KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**.\n\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n        The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the difference in the initial and final rest masses:\n        `KE_total = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV`.\n        This energy is shared between the two particles: `KE_total = KE_μ + KE_ν`.\n        `KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν`\n        `KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV`.\n        So, **KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (mu⁺) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (nu).

Define the System and Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Decay Process:** A stationary positive pion (Pi+) decays into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).\n    Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu\n*   **Initial State:** The pion is stationary.\n    *   Initial momentum, p_i = 0.\n    *   Initial energy, E_i, is the rest energy of the pion: E_i = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV.\n*   **Final State:** The products are a muon and a neutrino.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** To keep the total momentum zero, the muon and neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum magnitude be 'p'.\n        |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy equals the sum of the total energies of the final particles.\n        E_i = E_f  =>  m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**2. Apply Relativistic Formulas**\n\nThe total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)².\n\n*   **For the muon (mu+):** It has a rest mass m_μ = 105.7 MeV/c².\n    *   Its total energy is E_μ = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² ).\n    *   Its kinetic energy is KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc².\n*   **For the neutrino (nu):** It is assumed to be massless (m_ν = 0).\n    *   Its total energy is E_ν = √( (pc)² + 0 ) = pc.\n    *   For a massless particle, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy: KE_ν = E_ν = pc.\n\n**3. Solve for the Energies**\n\nWe have a system of equations to solve:\n1.  m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n2.  E_μ = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )\n3.  E_ν = pc\n\nSubstitute (3) into (1): m_πc² = E_μ + pc  =>  E_μ = m_πc² - pc.\nNow substitute this expression for E_μ into equation (2):\n(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nExpand the left side of the equation:\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nThe (pc)² term cancels on both sides. Now, we can solve for `pc`, which is the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν).\n(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\npc = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2(m_πc²) ]\n\n**4.

Solving for the Energies (The Calculation)**\nThis is the core of the problem, and nearly all the provided answers perform this calculation correctly.\n*   First, solve for `pc`, which is the energy (and kinetic energy) of the neutrino.\n    *   Rearrange the equation: $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   Square both sides: $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    *   Expand and simplify: $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    *   This leads to the formula for the neutrino's energy: $KE_{\\nu} = pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n*   Plug in the numbers:\n    *   $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78$ MeV. This rounds to **29.8 MeV**.\n*   Next, find the kinetic energy of the muon, $KE_{\\mu}$. The total kinetic energy released is the difference in rest masses:\n    *   $KE_{total} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9$ MeV.\n    *   This energy is shared: $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu}$.\n    *   $KE_{\\mu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.8 \\text{ MeV} = 4.1$ MeV. A more precise calculation gives **4.12 MeV**.\n\n**5. Careful Points and Conclusion**\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** Almost all candidate answers (at least 16 out of 17) correctly calculate the kinetic energies to be approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. This high level of agreement on the calculation itself gives strong confidence in the numerical result.\n*   **Identifying Particles:** The lighter, massless particle (neutrino) carries away more energy than the heavier, massive particle (muon).

For a massless particle, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, and E_ν = pc. Therefore, KE_ν = pc.\n\n5.  **Solve the System of Equations:**\n    *   We have the energy conservation equation: m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν.\n    *   Substitute E_ν = pc and E_μ = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² ):\n        m_πc² = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² ) + pc\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `pc` (which is the neutrino's kinetic energy):\n        m_πc² - pc = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )\n    *   Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n        (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n        (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   The (pc)² terms cancel out. Now, solve for `pc`:\n        pc = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2(m_πc²) ]\n    *   Plug in the numerical values:\n        pc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\n        pc = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / 279.2\n        pc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n    *   So, the kinetic energy of the neutrino is **KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Muon's Kinetic Energy:**\n    *   The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest energy between the initial and final states:\n        Q = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_πc² - m_μc²\n        Q = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n    *   Now, find the muon's kinetic energy:\n        KE_μ = Q - KE_ν\n        KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV\n    *   A more precise calculation using the unrounded value for KE_ν gives:\n        KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV = **4.12 MeV**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical:** The particle speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, so relativistic formulas for energy and momentum must be used.\n*   **Energy vs. Kinetic Energy:** For the massive muon, its total energy (E_μ) is the sum of its rest energy (m_μc²) and its kinetic energy (KE_μ).

A review of the candidate answers shows that while most performed the calculation correctly, several failed to map their result to the correct letter option. The overwhelming consensus of the correct calculations points to these values.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Physics**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary particle (a positive pion, Pi⁺) into two other particles (a positive muon, mu⁺, and a neutrino, nu). This is a classic example of a two-body decay, which is governed by the fundamental principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the speeds involved are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use the equations from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n### **2. Stating the Initial Conditions and Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The pion is stationary.\n    *   Initial Momentum (`p_initial`): 0\n    *   Initial Energy (`E_initial`): This is purely the rest energy of the pion, `E_initial = m_πc²`.\n\n*   **Final State:** The system consists of a muon and a neutrino.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n        `|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p`\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy must equal the total final energy, which is the sum of the total energies of the muon (`E_μ`) and the neutrino (`E_ν`).\n        `E_initial = E_final`\n        `m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν`\n\n### **3. Applying Relativistic Formulas**\n\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n\n*   **For the muon (mu⁺):** It has a rest mass `m_μ = 105.7 MeV/c²`. Its total energy is `E_μ = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )`. Its kinetic energy is `KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²`.\n*   **For the neutrino (nu):** In this context, the neutrino's mass is considered negligible (m_ν ≈ 0). This is a standard and highly accurate approximation. For a massless particle, the energy-momentum relation simplifies to `E_ν = pc`. Furthermore, since its rest energy is zero, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy: `KE_ν = E_ν = pc`.\n\n### **4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nWe have a system of equations to solve.\n\n1.  Start with the energy conservation equation: `m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν`\n2.  Substitute the expressions for `E_μ` and `E_ν`: `m_πc² = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² ) + pc`\n3.  Rearrange the equation to isolate the square root term, which makes it possible to solve for `pc`:\n    `m_πc² - pc = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )`\n4.  Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    `(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`\n5.  Expand the left side:\n    `(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`\n6.  The `(pc)²` term appears on both sides and can be canceled out. This simplifies the equation significantly:\n    `(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_μc²)²`\n7.  Now, solve for `pc`. This value is the kinetic energy of the neutrino (`KE_ν`).\n    `2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²`\n    `pc = KE_ν = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2 * m_πc² ]`\n8.  Plug in the given values (`m_πc² = 139.6 MeV`, `m_μc² = 105.7 MeV`):\n    `KE_ν = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n    `KE_ν = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / 279.2`\n    `KE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n    Rounding to one decimal place gives **KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**.\n\n9.  Finally, calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_μ`). The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the difference in rest energies, and this is shared between the two particles.\n    `KE_total = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_πc² - m_μc²`\n    `KE_total = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n    `KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν`\n    `KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV`\n    Rounding to two decimal places gives **KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV**.\n\n### **5. Conclusion and Careful Points**\n\n*   The calculated kinetic energies are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** It is essential to use relativistic equations. A non-relativistic calculation would give incorrect results.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** A common mistake is to simply split the Q-value (33.9 MeV) in some arbitrary way. Conservation of momentum dictates a unique energy for each particle. The lighter particle (neutrino) always receives more kinetic energy than the heavier one (muon).\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Many of the provided candidate answers perform the calculation correctly but then select the wrong multiple-choice letter.

Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem describes a two-body decay of a stationary particle. The solution relies on two fundamental conservation laws from physics:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is stationary, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the product particles must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay (the rest energy of the pion) must equal the total energy after the decay (the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino). Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their total energy is a sum of their kinetic energy and their rest mass energy.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information and Assumptions**\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+) ($m_{\\pi}$): 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+) ($m_{\\mu}$): 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The pion is stationary.\n*   The neutrino is assumed to be massless ($m_{\\nu} = 0$). This is a standard and valid approximation for this problem.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nLet `p` be the magnitude of the momentum of both the muon and the neutrino.\nLet `KE` be the kinetic energy.\n\n*   From the conservation of energy:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = (KE_{\\mu} + m_{\\mu}c^2) + KE_{\\nu}$\n\n*   The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is:\n    $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$:\n    *   For the massless neutrino, its total energy is purely kinetic: $E_{\\nu} = pc = KE_{\\nu}$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$.\n\n*   We can now solve for the unknown energies. A common method is to first find the energy of the neutrino:\n    $E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n    $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}$\n    $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2}$\n    $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   Now, find the kinetic energy of the muon using the total kinetic energy:\n    $KE_{\\mu} = KE_{total} - KE_{\\nu}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 33.9 - 29.78 \\approx 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4.

We can solve for `pc`, which is the energy (and kinetic energy) of the neutrino.\n    *   Rearrange the energy equation: `m_πc² - pc = sqrt((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)`.\n    *   Square both sides to eliminate the square root: `(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`.\n    *   Expand the left side: `(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`.\n    *   The `(pc)²` term cancels out. Now, solve for `pc`:\n        `pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Values:**\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n        Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is its total energy, `KE_ν = E_ν = pc`.\n        `KE_ν = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]`\n        `KE_ν = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2`\n        `KE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV`.\n        Rounding gives **KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**.\n\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n        The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the difference in the initial and final rest masses:\n        `KE_total = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV`.\n        This energy is shared between the two particles: `KE_total = KE_μ + KE_ν`.\n        `KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν`\n        `KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV`.\n        So, **KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (mu⁺) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (nu).

This rounds to **29.8 MeV**.\n*   Next, find the kinetic energy of the muon, $KE_{\\mu}$. The total kinetic energy released is the difference in rest masses:\n    *   $KE_{total} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9$ MeV.\n    *   This energy is shared: $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu}$.\n    *   $KE_{\\mu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.8 \\text{ MeV} = 4.1$ MeV.

Its total energy is its rest mass energy.\n    *   **Given Masses:**\n        *   Rest mass of Pi⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n        *   Rest mass of mu⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The total momentum before the decay is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n    *   Let `p` be the magnitude of the momentum for both particles: |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν): E_final = E_μ + E_ν.\n    *   Equating initial and final energy: m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν.\n\n4.  **Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   **For the muon (mu⁺):** E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc², where KE_μ is its kinetic energy.\n    *   **For the neutrino (nu):** It is standard to assume the neutrino is massless (m_ν = 0). For a massless particle, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, and E_ν = pc. Therefore, KE_ν = pc.\n\n5.  **Solve the System of Equations:**\n    *   We have the energy conservation equation: m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν.\n    *   Substitute E_ν = pc and E_μ = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² ):\n        m_πc² = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² ) + pc\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `pc` (which is the neutrino's kinetic energy):\n        m_πc² - pc = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )\n    *   Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n        (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n        (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   The (pc)² terms cancel out. Now, solve for `pc`:\n        pc = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2(m_πc²) ]\n    *   Plug in the numerical values:\n        pc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\n        pc = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / 279.2\n        pc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n    *   So, the kinetic energy of the neutrino is **KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Muon's Kinetic Energy:**\n    *   The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest energy between the initial and final states:\n        Q = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_πc² - m_μc²\n        Q = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n    *   Now, find the muon's kinetic energy:\n        KE_μ = Q - KE_ν\n        KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV\n    *   A more precise calculation using the unrounded value for KE_ν gives:\n        KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV = **4.12 MeV**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical:** The particle speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, so relativistic formulas for energy and momentum must be used.\n*   **Energy vs. Kinetic Energy:** For the massive muon, its total energy (E_μ) is the sum of its rest energy (m_μc²) and its kinetic energy (KE_μ). For the massless neutrino, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy.\n*   **Energy Distribution:** In a two-body decay from rest, the lighter particle always receives more kinetic energy than the heavier particle. Our result (KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV > KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV) is consistent with this principle.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (mu⁺) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (nu).

A review of the candidate answers shows that while most performed the calculation correctly, several failed to map their result to the correct letter option. The overwhelming consensus of the correct calculations points to these values.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Physics**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary particle (a positive pion, Pi⁺) into two other particles (a positive muon, mu⁺, and a neutrino, nu). This is a classic example of a two-body decay, which is governed by the fundamental principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the speeds involved are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use the equations from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n### **2. Stating the Initial Conditions and Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The pion is stationary.\n    *   Initial Momentum (`p_initial`): 0\n    *   Initial Energy (`E_initial`): This is purely the rest energy of the pion, `E_initial = m_πc²`.\n\n*   **Final State:** The system consists of a muon and a neutrino.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n        `|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p`\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy must equal the total final energy, which is the sum of the total energies of the muon (`E_μ`) and the neutrino (`E_ν`).\n        `E_initial = E_final`\n        `m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν`\n\n### **3. Applying Relativistic Formulas**\n\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n\n*   **For the muon (mu⁺):** It has a rest mass `m_μ = 105.7 MeV/c²`. Its total energy is `E_μ = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )`. Its kinetic energy is `KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²`.\n*   **For the neutrino (nu):** In this context, the neutrino's mass is considered negligible (m_ν ≈ 0). This is a standard and highly accurate approximation. For a massless particle, the energy-momentum relation simplifies to `E_ν = pc`. Furthermore, since its rest energy is zero, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy: `KE_ν = E_ν = pc`.\n\n### **4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nWe have a system of equations to solve.\n\n1.  Start with the energy conservation equation: `m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν`\n2.  Substitute the expressions for `E_μ` and `E_ν`: `m_πc² = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² ) + pc`\n3.  Rearrange the equation to isolate the square root term, which makes it possible to solve for `pc`:\n    `m_πc² - pc = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )`\n4.  Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    `(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`\n5.  Expand the left side:\n    `(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`\n6.  The `(pc)²` term appears on both sides and can be canceled out. This simplifies the equation significantly:\n    `(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_μc²)²`\n7.  Now, solve for `pc`. This value is the kinetic energy of the neutrino (`KE_ν`).\n    `2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²`\n    `pc = KE_ν = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2 * m_πc² ]`\n8.  Plug in the given values (`m_πc² = 139.6 MeV`, `m_μc² = 105.7 MeV`):\n    `KE_ν = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n    `KE_ν = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / 279.2`\n    `KE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n    Rounding to one decimal place gives **KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**.\n\n9.  Finally, calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_μ`). The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the difference in rest energies, and this is shared between the two particles.\n    `KE_total = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_πc² - m_μc²`\n    `KE_total = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n    `KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν`\n    `KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV`\n    Rounding to two decimal places gives **KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV**.\n\n### **5. Conclusion and Careful Points**\n\n*   The calculated kinetic energies are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** It is essential to use relativistic equations. A non-relativistic calculation would give incorrect results.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** A common mistake is to simply split the Q-value (33.9 MeV) in some arbitrary way. Conservation of momentum dictates a unique energy for each particle. The lighter particle (neutrino) always receives more kinetic energy than the heavier one (muon).\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Many of the provided candidate answers perform the calculation correctly but then select the wrong multiple-choice letter. Our calculated values of (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV) correspond directly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
