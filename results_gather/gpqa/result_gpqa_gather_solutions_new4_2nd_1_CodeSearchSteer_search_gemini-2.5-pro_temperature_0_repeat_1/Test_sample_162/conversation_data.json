The process involves two main considerations:\n1.  The amount of acid needed to react stoichiometrically with the iron(III) hydroxide.\n2.  The additional amount of acid needed to remain in the solution to maintain a pH low enough to prevent the dissolved iron(III) ions from precipitating back out.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.**\nFirst, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = (Molar Mass of Fe) + 3 × (Molar Mass of O + Molar Mass of H)\n*   Molar Mass ≈ 55.85 g/mol + 3 × (16.00 g/mol + 1.01 g/mol) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the amount of acid needed for the reaction.**\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid follows the balanced chemical equation:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe stoichiometry shows that 3 moles of H⁺ ions are required for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ (for reaction) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ (for reaction) = 3 × 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Test the options for self-consistency.**\nThe total amount of acid added must equal the sum of the acid that reacted and the acid that remains in the final solution. We can test each option to see if this condition holds true.\n\n**Total Moles of H⁺ Added = Moles of H⁺ (for reaction) + Moles of H⁺ (remaining)**\n\nThe moles of H⁺ remaining are calculated from the given pH and the total volume (100 cm³ = 0.1 L):\n*   Moles of H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺]final × Total Volume = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) × 0.1 L\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ added are calculated from the given volume of 0.1 M acid:\n*   Total Moles of H⁺ Added = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × (Volume in cm³ / 1000)\n\nLet's test **Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of H⁺ remaining at pH 2.69:**\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (remaining) = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ required for this scenario:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (for reaction) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = 0.0030112 mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed to provide this total amount of H⁺:**\n    *   Volume = Total Moles H⁺ / Molarity\n    *   Volume = 0.0030112 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030112 L.\n    *   Volume in cm³ = 0.030112 L × 1000 cm³/L = 30.11 cm³.\n\n4.  **Compare:** The calculated volume of **30.11 cm³** is an excellent match for the volume given in Option D, which is **30.09 cm³**. The minor difference is due to rounding of atomic masses and constants.\n\nTesting the other options reveals significant inconsistencies between the given pH and the volume of acid. Therefore, Option D is the only chemically and mathematically consistent choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the given volume of acid is consistent with the amount needed to both dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given final pH.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Stoichiometry of the Reaction**\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of strong acid (H⁺) needed to react with and dissolve the 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃).\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Fe ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n    *   O ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   H ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** The dissolution reaction is Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l). The stoichiometry is 3 moles of H⁺ for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**2. Total Acid Requirement**\n\nThe total volume of acid added must provide enough H⁺ for two purposes:\n1.  The amount consumed in the reaction (0.002807 mol).\n2.  The excess amount remaining in the 100 cm³ solution to create the final pH.\n\n**3. Consistency Check of the Options**\n\nWe can now test each option to see if the given volume and pH are consistent with each other. The total moles of H⁺ required can be calculated as:\n`Total Moles H⁺ = (Moles H⁺ reacted) + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L)`\nThe required volume is then:\n`Volume (cm³) = (Total Moles H⁺ / 0.1 M) × 1000`\n\n*   **Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   Moles H⁺ remaining = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = 0.0030112 mol.\n    *   Calculated Volume = (0.0030112 mol / 0.1 M) × 1000 = **30.11 cm³**.\n    *   This calculated volume is an excellent match for the given volume of 30.09 cm³.\n\n*   **Option B: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   The volume of 20.40 cm³ is less than the ~28.1 cm³ required just for the reaction, so this option is impossible.\n\n*   **Option C: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   Moles H⁺ remaining = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.0000692 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol + 0.0000692 mol = 0.0028762 mol.\n    *   Calculated Volume = (0.0028762 mol / 0.1 M) × 1000 = **28.76 cm³**.\n    *   This does not match the given volume of 32.14 cm³.\n\n*   **Option D: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   Moles H⁺ remaining = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.00912 M × 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol + 0.000912 mol = 0.003719 mol.\n    *   Calculated Volume = (0.003719 mol / 0.1 M) × 1000 = **37.19 cm³**.\n    *   This does not match the given volume of 28.05 cm³.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly Option A provides a pair of values where the volume of acid is consistent with the amount required to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the final pH.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the final answer, we must find the option where the given volume of acid and the final pH are consistent with the chemical principles of the dissolution.\n\nThe overall process involves two main components:\n1.  The stoichiometric reaction of the strong acid with the iron(III) hydroxide.\n2.  The establishment of a final acidic pH to ensure the dissolved iron(III) ions remain in solution.\n\nLet's break down the calculation and test the options for self-consistency.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.**\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ ≈ 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the moles of H⁺ required for the stoichiometric reaction.**\nThe dissolution reaction is: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l).\nFrom the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Test the options for consistency.**\nThe total amount of acid added must account for both the acid that reacts and the excess acid that remains to set the final pH.\nTotal Moles H⁺ = (Moles H⁺ reacted) + (Moles H⁺ remaining)\nVolume of Acid (cm³) = (Total Moles H⁺ / 0.1 M) * 1000\n\nLet's test each option by assuming the given pH is correct and calculating the required volume.\n\n*   **A) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   Moles H⁺ remaining = (10⁻².⁰⁴ M) * 0.1 L ≈ 0.000912 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = 0.003719 mol.\n    *   Calculated Volume = (0.003719 / 0.1) * 1000 = 37.19 cm³.\n    *   This does **not** match the given volume of 28.05 cm³.\n\n*   **B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   Moles H⁺ remaining = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) * 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = 0.003011 mol.\n    *   Calculated Volume = (0.003011 / 0.1) * 1000 = **30.11 cm³**.\n    *   This calculated volume is an excellent match for the given volume of **30.09 cm³**. The minor difference is due to rounding. This option is self-consistent.\n\n*   **C) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   Moles H⁺ remaining = (10⁻³.¹⁶ M) * 0.1 L ≈ 0.000069 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = 0.002876 mol.\n    *   Calculated Volume = (0.002876 / 0.1) * 1000 = 28.76 cm³.\n    *   This does **not** match the given volume of 32.14 cm³.\n\n*   **D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   The volume of 20.40 cm³ is less than the volume required just for the stoichiometric reaction (~28.1 cm³), so it is impossible for this option to be correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only option where the given pH and volume are arithmetically consistent is Option B. This method assumes that the final pH is primarily determined by the excess strong acid, which is a common simplification in such problems. The other options are internally inconsistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Process**\n\nTo dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, we must add a strong acid. The process involves two key components:\n*   **Stoichiometric Reaction:** The acid (H⁺) neutralizes the hydroxide base to form water and dissolved iron(III) ions.\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Equilibrium Maintenance:** After the reaction, a certain amount of excess H⁺ must remain in the solution to keep the pH low enough to prevent the Fe³⁺ from reacting with water and re-precipitating as Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe total amount of acid added is the sum of the acid consumed in the reaction and the excess acid remaining in the final solution.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = (Molar Mass of Fe) + 3 × (Molar Mass of O + Molar Mass of H)\n*   Molar Mass ≈ 55.85 + 3 × (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\nNow, we calculate the moles in the 0.1 g sample.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n\n**3. Calculate the Moles of H⁺ Needed for the Reaction**\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺), we need 3 moles of H⁺ for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**4. Perform a Consistency Check on the Options**\n\nSince this is a multiple-choice question, the most reliable method is to check which option is self-consistent. For each option, we can calculate if the given volume of acid is the correct amount needed to both complete the reaction and establish the given final pH.\n\n**Let's test Option C: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n*   **Step 4a: Calculate the total moles of H⁺ added.**\n    The acid is 0.1 M and the volume is 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L).\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ added = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = 0.003009 mol.\n\n*   **Step 4b: Calculate the moles of excess H⁺ that would remain.**\n    This is the total acid added minus the acid consumed by the reaction.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (excess) = Total Moles H⁺ added - Moles H⁺ (reacted)\n    *   Moles H⁺ (excess) = 0.003009 mol - 0.002807 mol = 0.000202 mol.\n\n*   **Step 4c: Calculate the pH that this excess H⁺ would create.**\n    This excess acid is in the final solution volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   [H⁺] = Moles H⁺ (excess) / Final Volume\n    *   [H⁺] = 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\n    *   pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.00202) ≈ 2.695.\n\n*   **Step 4d: Compare.**\n    The calculated pH (2.695) is an excellent match for the pH given in Option C (2.69). This shows that Option C is internally consistent.\n\n**Checking Other Options (Briefly):**\n\n*   **Option D (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³):** The volume of acid (28.05 cm³) provides 0.002805 moles of H⁺. This is almost exactly the amount needed for the reaction (0.002807 mol), leaving virtually no excess acid. The pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺, which results in a pH of about 2.3, not 2.04. Thus, this option is inconsistent.\n*   **Option B (pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³):** Following the same consistency check, the 32.14 cm³ of acid would result in a pH of approximately 2.39, which does not match the given pH of 3.16.\n*   **Option A (pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³):** The 20.40 cm³ of acid is not even enough to complete the stoichiometric reaction, so this option is impossible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option where the volume of acid and the final pH are consistent with each other is Option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Chemical Processes**\n\nTo solve this problem, we must account for two distinct requirements for the added acid:\n*   **Stoichiometric Reaction:** The acid must provide enough H⁺ ions to neutralize and dissolve the solid Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Reaction: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Equilibrium Condition:** After dissolution, some excess H⁺ must remain in the solution to keep the final pH low enough to prevent the Fe(OH)₃ from precipitating back out. The total acid added is the sum of the acid used for the reaction and the acid remaining to set the final pH.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃ and the Stoichiometric Acid Requirement**\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** 55.845 (Fe) + 3 * (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** From the 1:3 stoichiometry of the reaction, we need 3 times the moles of H⁺ as Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * 0.0009357 mol = 0.002807 mol.\n\n**3. The \"Consistency Check\" Method**\n\nSince we are given multiple-choice options, the most reliable method is to check which option is internally consistent. For a given option (with a specific pH and volume), we can calculate if that volume of acid is exactly what's needed to both react with the Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to produce the given pH.\n\nLet's test **Option C: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**.\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate excess H⁺ needed for the given pH.**\n    *   The final pH is 2.69.\n    *   The concentration of H⁺ needed is [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   The total volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (remaining) = Concentration × Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol.\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the total H⁺ required.**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = 0.0030112 mol.\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed to provide this total.**\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Molarity\n    *   Volume = 0.0030112 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030112 L.\n    *   Converting to cm³: 0.030112 L × 1000 cm³/L = **30.11 cm³**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated volume of **30.11 cm³** is an excellent match for the volume given in Option C, which is **30.09 cm³**. The minor difference is due to rounding of physical constants. No other option demonstrates this internal consistency. For example, checking Option D (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³) would require a calculated volume of 37.2 cm³, which is a significant mismatch.\n\nTherefore, Option C is the only chemically and mathematically consistent answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the given volume of acid and the final pH are chemically consistent with each other. The total amount of acid added must be sufficient for two purposes:\n1.  To react stoichiometrically with the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  To remain as excess H⁺ in the 100 cm³ solution to establish the final pH.\n\nLet's break down the calculation.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ and the stoichiometric acid requirement.**\n\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 * (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.\n\nThe dissolution reaction is: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l).\nFrom the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed for reaction = 3 * 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Test each option for self-consistency.**\n\nWe will use the following formula to check each option:\nTotal Moles H⁺ = (Moles H⁺ for reaction) + (Moles H⁺ remaining for final pH)\nCalculated Volume of Acid = (Total Moles H⁺) / (Concentration of Acid)\n\n*   Moles H⁺ for reaction = 0.002807 mol\n*   Final solution volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n*   Acid concentration = 0.1 M\n\n**A) Test Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   Final [H⁺] = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n*   Moles of H⁺ remaining = [H⁺] × Volume = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol.\n*   Total moles of H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol (reaction) + 0.0002042 mol (remaining) = 0.0030112 mol.\n*   Calculated volume = 0.0030112 mol / 0.1 M = 0.030112 L = **30.11 cm³**.\n*   **Result:** The calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is an excellent match for the given volume (30.09 cm³). This option is consistent.\n\n**B) Test Option B: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n*   The volume of acid needed for the reaction alone is `0.002807 mol / 0.1 M = 28.07 cm³`. The given volume of 20.40 cm³ is insufficient to even dissolve the solid. This option is impossible.\n\n**C) Test Option C: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n*   Final [H⁺] = 10⁻³·¹⁶ M ≈ 0.000692 M.\n*   Moles of H⁺ remaining = 0.000692 M × 0.1 L = 0.0000692 mol.\n*   Total moles of H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol + 0.0000692 mol = 0.0028762 mol.\n*   Calculated volume = 0.0028762 mol / 0.1 M = 0.028762 L = **28.76 cm³**.\n*   **Result:** The calculated volume (28.76 cm³) does not match the given volume (32.14 cm³).

This option is inconsistent.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOnly option A provides a pair of pH and volume values that are consistent with the chemical principles of the reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Process**\n\nThe problem involves dissolving a solid base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), using a strong acid. This process requires two things:\n*   **Stoichiometric Reaction:** Enough acid (H⁺ ions) must be added to react with all the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   **Equilibrium Condition:** After the reaction, some excess acid must remain in the solution to keep the final pH low enough to prevent the Fe(OH)₃ from precipitating back out.\n\nThe total amount of acid added is the sum of the acid used for the reaction and the acid that remains to set the final pH.\n\n**2.

Understand the Chemical Process**\n\nThe problem involves dissolving a solid base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), using a strong acid. This process requires two considerations:\n*   **Stoichiometric Reaction:** A certain amount of acid is consumed to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃. The reaction is: `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`.\n*   **Equilibrium Condition:** To prevent the dissolved Fe³⁺ from precipitating back into Fe(OH)₃, the final solution must remain acidic. The amount of excess acid determines the final pH.\n\nThe total amount of acid added is the sum of the acid that reacted and the acid that remains to set the final pH.\n`Total Acid = Reacted Acid + Remaining (Excess) Acid`\n\n### **2. Calculate the Stoichiometric Acid Requirement**\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ ≈ 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n\nFrom the reaction stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ reacted = 3 * 0.0009356 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Options for Self-Consistency**\n\nThe most reliable way to solve this multiple-choice question is to test which option provides a consistent set of values.

This option is self-consistent.\n\n**B) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:** 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = 0.003214 mol.\n*   **Moles H⁺ Remaining:** [H⁺] = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M ≈ 0.000692 M. Moles = 0.000692 M × 0.1 L = 0.0000692 mol.\n*   **Consistency Check:** 0.002807 mol (reacted) + 0.0000692 mol (remaining) = 0.0028762 mol.\n*   **Conclusion:** This does not match the added moles (0.003214 mol). Inconsistent.\n\n**C) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:** 0.02040 L × 0.1 M = 0.002040 mol.\n*   **Conclusion:** This is less than the 0.002807 moles required just for the reaction. This volume is insufficient to dissolve the solid. Inconsistent.\n\n**D) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:** 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = 0.002805 mol.\n*   **Moles H⁺ Remaining:** [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M ≈ 0.00912 M. Moles = 0.00912 M × 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.\n*   **Consistency Check:** 0.002807 mol (reacted) + 0.000912 mol (remaining) = 0.003719 mol.\n*   **Conclusion:** This does not match the added moles (0.002805 mol).

Test the Consistency of Each Option**\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ added must equal the moles reacted plus the moles remaining in the solution to create the final pH.\n`Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)`\n`Moles H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺]final * Volume = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) * (0.1 L)`\n\nLet's test **Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**.\n\n*   **Calculate moles of H⁺ remaining at pH 2.69:**\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = 0.002042 mol/L * 0.1 L ≈ **0.000204 mol**.\n\n*   **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ required:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol (reacted) + 0.000204 mol (remaining) = **0.003011 mol**.\n\n*   **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed to supply this total:**\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Molarity = 0.003011 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03011 L.\n    *   Volume in cm³ = 0.03011 L * 1000 cm³/L = **30.11 cm³**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated volume of **30.11 cm³** is an excellent match for the volume given in Option B (**30.09 cm³**). The minor difference is due to rounding of constants. Performing the same consistency check for the other options reveals significant mismatches between the given and calculated volumes. Therefore, Option B is the only self-consistent and correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the given volume of acid is consistent with the amount needed to both dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given final pH.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass = (Atomic Mass of Fe) + 3 × (Atomic Mass of O + Atomic Mass of H)\n*   Molar Mass ≈ 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**2. Understand the Acid Requirement**\n\nThe added strong acid (H⁺) serves two purposes:\n*   **Reaction:** It reacts stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃ to dissolve it.\n*   **Equilibrium:** An excess amount remains in the solution to maintain an acidic pH and prevent the Fe(OH)₃ from precipitating back out.\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ added must equal the sum of the moles used in the reaction and the moles remaining in the final solution.\n`Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)`\n\n**3. Calculate Moles of H⁺ for the Reaction**\n\nThe dissolution reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFrom the 1:3 stoichiometry, the moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction are:\n*   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n**4. Test the Options for Self-Consistency**\n\nWe will now test each option to see if the given volume of acid corresponds to the amount needed for the reaction plus the amount needed to create the given pH.\n\n*   **Test Option A: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   The volume of acid required for the reaction alone is (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 28.07 cm³.\n    *   The given volume of 28.05 cm³ is not even enough to complete the reaction, let alone provide excess acid to lower the pH to 2.04. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Test Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   **Moles H⁺ remaining:** The amount of H⁺ needed to achieve a pH of 2.69 in a 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution is:\n        *   [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 2.042 x 10⁻³ M\n        *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = Concentration × Volume = (2.042 x 10⁻³ mol/L) × 0.1 L = 2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n    *   **Total Moles H⁺ needed:**\n        *   Total Moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) + (2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 3.011 x 10⁻³ mol\n    *   **Calculated Volume of Acid:**\n        *   Volume = Total Moles / Molarity = (3.011 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.03011 L\n        *   Volume = 30.11 cm³\n    *   **Conclusion:** The calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is an excellent match for the given volume (30.09 cm³). This option is self-consistent.\n\n*   **Test Option C: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   The given volume of 20.40 cm³ is significantly less than the 28.07 cm³ required just for the reaction. The solid would not dissolve. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Test Option D: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   **Moles H⁺ remaining:**\n        *   [H⁺] = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M ≈ 6.918 x 10⁻⁴ M\n        *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = (6.918 x 10⁻⁴ mol/L) × 0.1 L = 6.918 x 10⁻⁵ mol\n    *   **Total Moles H⁺ needed:**\n        *   Total Moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) + (6.918 x 10⁻⁵ mol) = 2.876 x 10⁻³ mol\n    *   **Calculated Volume of Acid:**\n        *   Volume = (2.876 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.02876 L = 28.76 cm³\n    *   **Conclusion:** The calculated volume (28.76 cm³) does not match the given volume (32.14 cm³). This option is inconsistent.\n\nBased on the analysis, only Option B provides a pair of values where the volume of acid is consistent with the amount required to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the final pH.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python script was executed to determine the correct answer by checking the internal consistency of each multiple-choice option.\n\nFirst, the script calculated the moles of H⁺ required to stoichiometrically react with 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃, which was found to be `0.002807 mol`.\n\nThen, it tested each option:\n*   **Options A and B:** The provided acid volumes (20.40 cm³ and 28.05 cm³) were insufficient to supply the `0.002807 mol` of H⁺ needed for the initial reaction. Therefore, they could not be correct.\n*   **Option D:** The given volume of 32.14 cm³ would leave an excess of H⁺ that results in a calculated pH of 2.39. This does not match the given pH of 3.16.\n*   **Option C:** The given volume of 30.09 cm³ provides enough acid to complete the reaction and leaves an excess of H⁺. The code calculated that this excess would result in a pH of 2.70. This is an excellent match for the pH of 2.69 given in the option.\n\nThe analysis shows that only Option C provides a pair of values (pH and volume) that are chemically and mathematically consistent with each other.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Process**\n\nThe problem involves dissolving a sparingly soluble base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), using a strong acid. The total amount of acid added must be sufficient for two tasks:\n*   **Neutralization:** To react stoichiometrically with all the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   **Equilibrium:** To provide an excess of H⁺ ions that remain in the solution, lowering the pH enough to prevent the dissolved Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out as Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe overall chemical reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be Dissolved**\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = (Molar Mass of Fe) + 3 × (Molar Mass of O + Molar Mass of H)\n*   Molar Mass ≈ 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the Moles of H⁺ Consumed in the Reaction**\n\nFrom the reaction's stoichiometry (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺), we know that 3 moles of H⁺ are consumed for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ (consumed) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ (consumed) = 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol\n\n**4. Test the Options for Self-Consistency**\n\nThis is the most robust method to solve the problem, as it avoids uncertainties related to the exact value of the solubility product constant (Ksp). We will check if the given volume of acid in each option is consistent with the amount needed to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given pH.\n\nThe governing equation is:\n**Total Moles of H⁺ Added = Moles of H⁺ Consumed + Moles of H⁺ Remaining**\n\nWhere:\n*   Total Moles of H⁺ Added = Volume of Acid (L) × 0.1 mol/L\n*   Moles of H⁺ Consumed ≈ 0.002807 mol (calculated above)\n*   Moles of H⁺ Remaining = Final [H⁺] × Final Volume (L) = 10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L\n\nLet's test each option:\n\n**A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.0204 L)**\n*   Total H⁺ added = 0.0204 L × 0.1 M = 0.00204 mol.\n*   This amount (0.00204 mol) is less than the amount needed just for the reaction (0.002807 mol). Therefore, this option is incorrect as not all the Fe(OH)₃ would dissolve.\n\n**B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n*   Total H⁺ added = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   Total H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol (consumed) + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L)\n*   Total H⁺ needed = 0.002807 + (0.002042 × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.0002042 = **0.0030112 mol**.\n*   The amount of acid added (0.003009 mol) is an excellent match for the amount of acid needed (0.0030112 mol). The minor difference is due to rounding. This option is self-consistent.\n\n**C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n*   Total H⁺ added = 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = 0.002805 mol.\n*   This amount is almost exactly what is needed for the reaction alone (0.002807 mol), leaving virtually no excess acid. However, to achieve a pH of 2.04, a significant amount of excess acid is required: Moles remaining = 10⁻².⁰⁴ × 0.1 = 0.000912 mol. This option is inconsistent.\n\n**D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n*   Total H⁺ added = 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = **0.003214 mol**.\n*   Total H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol (consumed) + (10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L)\n*   Total H⁺ needed = 0.002807 + (0.0000692) = **0.002876 mol**.\n*   The amount of acid added (0.003214 mol) does not match the amount needed (0.002876 mol).

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Core Chemical Process**\n\nThe task is to dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a solution using a strong acid. The added acid serves two distinct purposes:\n*   **Stoichiometric Reaction:** First, the acid must provide enough H⁺ ions to react with and neutralize the solid base, causing it to dissolve into aqueous ions.\n*   **Equilibrium Maintenance:** Second, an excess amount of acid must remain in the final solution to keep the pH low. This prevents the dissolved iron(III) ions (Fe³⁺) from reacting with water (hydrolysis) and re-precipitating as Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe total amount of acid added is the sum of the acid consumed in the reaction and the excess acid remaining in the final solution.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Acid Required for the Stoichiometric Reaction**\n\nThis step determines the minimum amount of acid needed just to make the solid disappear.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The balanced chemical equation for the dissolution is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** Using standard atomic weights (Fe ≈ 55.85, O ≈ 16.00, H ≈ 1.01 g/mol), the molar mass is approximately 106.88 g/mol.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** We calculate the moles present in the 0.1 g sample:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** From the 1:3 stoichiometry of the reaction, we need three times the moles of H⁺ as Fe(OH)₃:\n    Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009356 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Options for Self-Consistency**\n\nSince this is a multiple-choice question, the most reliable method is to check which option presents a pair of (pH, Volume) values that are chemically and mathematically consistent. For a given option, the volume of acid added must be exactly enough to perform the reaction (Step 2) AND leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to produce the given pH in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution.\n\nThe governing equation is:\n**Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)**\n\nLet's test each option:\n\n*   **A) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   **Moles H⁺ remaining:** [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M. In 0.1 L, this is 0.0002042 mol.\n    *   **Total H⁺ needed:** 0.002807 mol (reacted) + 0.0002042 mol (remaining) = **0.0030112 mol**.\n    *   **Volume required:** Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.0030112 mol / 0.1 M = 0.030112 L = **30.11 cm³**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is an excellent match for the given volume (30.09 cm³). This option is self-consistent.\n\n*   **B) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   **Moles H⁺ remaining:** [H⁺] = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M ≈ 0.000692 M. In 0.1 L, this is 0.0000692 mol.\n    *   **Total H⁺ needed:** 0.002807 mol + 0.0000692 mol = 0.0028762 mol.\n    *   **Volume required:** 0.0028762 mol / 0.1 M = 0.028762 L = 28.76 cm³.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The calculated volume (28.76 cm³) does not match the given volume (32.14 cm³). Inconsistent.\n\n*   **C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   **Volume for reaction alone:** The volume of 0.1 M acid needed just for the reaction is 0.002807 mol / 0.1 M = 28.07 cm³. The given volume of 28.05 cm³ is insufficient to even complete the reaction, let alone provide an excess to lower the pH to 2.04. Inconsistent.\n\n*   **D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   **Volume for reaction alone:** As calculated above, 28.07 cm³ is needed just for the reaction. The given volume of 20.40 cm³ is far too low. Inconsistent.\n\n### **Final Decision and Careful Points**\n\n*   The analysis confirms that only Option A is internally consistent. The volume of acid provided (30.09 cm³) is sufficient to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the final pH of 2.69.\n*   A crucial point is recognizing that the acid has two roles: reaction and pH control. Simply calculating the acid for the reaction (~28.07 cm³) is not enough.\n*   The consistency check is the most powerful tool for this type of problem, as it validates the entire system described by each option.\n\n<<<A>>>"

The process involves two main considerations:\n1.  The amount of acid needed to react stoichiometrically with the iron(III) hydroxide.\n2.  The additional amount of acid needed to remain in the solution to maintain a pH low enough to prevent the dissolved iron(III) ions from precipitating back out.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.**\nFirst, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = (Molar Mass of Fe) + 3 × (Molar Mass of O + Molar Mass of H)\n*   Molar Mass ≈ 55.85 g/mol + 3 × (16.00 g/mol + 1.01 g/mol) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the amount of acid needed for the reaction.**\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid follows the balanced chemical equation:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe stoichiometry shows that 3 moles of H⁺ ions are required for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ (for reaction) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ (for reaction) = 3 × 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Test the options for self-consistency.**\nThe total amount of acid added must equal the sum of the acid that reacted and the acid that remains in the final solution. We can test each option to see if this condition holds true.\n\n**Total Moles of H⁺ Added = Moles of H⁺ (for reaction) + Moles of H⁺ (remaining)**\n\nThe moles of H⁺ remaining are calculated from the given pH and the total volume (100 cm³ = 0.1 L):\n*   Moles of H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺]final × Total Volume = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) × 0.1 L\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ added are calculated from the given volume of 0.1 M acid:\n*   Total Moles of H⁺ Added = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × (Volume in cm³ / 1000)\n\nLet's test **Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of H⁺ remaining at pH 2.69:**\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (remaining) = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ required for this scenario:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (for reaction) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = 0.0030112 mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed to provide this total amount of H⁺:**\n    *   Volume = Total Moles H⁺ / Molarity\n    *   Volume = 0.0030112 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030112 L.\n    *   Volume in cm³ = 0.030112 L × 1000 cm³/L = 30.11 cm³.\n\n4.  **Compare:** The calculated volume of **30.11 cm³** is an excellent match for the volume given in Option D, which is **30.09 cm³**. The minor difference is due to rounding of atomic masses and constants.\n\nTesting the other options reveals significant inconsistencies between the given pH and the volume of acid. Therefore, Option D is the only chemically and mathematically consistent choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the given volume of acid is consistent with the amount needed to both dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given final pH.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Stoichiometry of the Reaction**\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of strong acid (H⁺) needed to react with and dissolve the 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃).\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Fe ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n    *   O ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   H ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** The dissolution reaction is Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l). The stoichiometry is 3 moles of H⁺ for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**2. Total Acid Requirement**\n\nThe total volume of acid added must provide enough H⁺ for two purposes:\n1.  The amount consumed in the reaction (0.002807 mol).\n2.  The excess amount remaining in the 100 cm³ solution to create the final pH.\n\n**3. Consistency Check of the Options**\n\nWe can now test each option to see if the given volume and pH are consistent with each other. The total moles of H⁺ required can be calculated as:\n`Total Moles H⁺ = (Moles H⁺ reacted) + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L)`\nThe required volume is then:\n`Volume (cm³) = (Total Moles H⁺ / 0.1 M) × 1000`\n\n*   **Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   Moles H⁺ remaining = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = 0.0030112 mol.\n    *   Calculated Volume = (0.0030112 mol / 0.1 M) × 1000 = **30.11 cm³**.\n    *   This calculated volume is an excellent match for the given volume of 30.09 cm³.\n\n*   **Option B: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   The volume of 20.40 cm³ is less than the ~28.1 cm³ required just for the reaction, so this option is impossible.\n\n*   **Option C: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   Moles H⁺ remaining = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.0000692 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol + 0.0000692 mol = 0.0028762 mol.\n    *   Calculated Volume = (0.0028762 mol / 0.1 M) × 1000 = **28.76 cm³**.\n    *   This does not match the given volume of 32.14 cm³.\n\n*   **Option D: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   Moles H⁺ remaining = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.00912 M × 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol + 0.000912 mol = 0.003719 mol.\n    *   Calculated Volume = (0.003719 mol / 0.1 M) × 1000 = **37.19 cm³**.\n    *   This does not match the given volume of 28.05 cm³.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly Option A provides a pair of values where the volume of acid is consistent with the amount required to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the final pH.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the final answer, we must find the option where the given volume of acid and the final pH are consistent with the chemical principles of the dissolution.\n\nThe overall process involves two main components:\n1.  The stoichiometric reaction of the strong acid with the iron(III) hydroxide.\n2.  The establishment of a final acidic pH to ensure the dissolved iron(III) ions remain in solution.\n\nLet's break down the calculation and test the options for self-consistency.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.**\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ ≈ 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the moles of H⁺ required for the stoichiometric reaction.**\nThe dissolution reaction is: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l).\nFrom the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Test the options for consistency.**\nThe total amount of acid added must account for both the acid that reacts and the excess acid that remains to set the final pH.\nTotal Moles H⁺ = (Moles H⁺ reacted) + (Moles H⁺ remaining)\nVolume of Acid (cm³) = (Total Moles H⁺ / 0.1 M) * 1000\n\nLet's test each option by assuming the given pH is correct and calculating the required volume.\n\n*   **A) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   Moles H⁺ remaining = (10⁻².⁰⁴ M) * 0.1 L ≈ 0.000912 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = 0.003719 mol.\n    *   Calculated Volume = (0.003719 / 0.1) * 1000 = 37.19 cm³.\n    *   This does **not** match the given volume of 28.05 cm³.\n\n*   **B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   Moles H⁺ remaining = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) * 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = 0.003011 mol.\n    *   Calculated Volume = (0.003011 / 0.1) * 1000 = **30.11 cm³**.\n    *   This calculated volume is an excellent match for the given volume of **30.09 cm³**.

This method assumes that the final pH is primarily determined by the excess strong acid, which is a common simplification in such problems. The other options are internally inconsistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Process**\n\nTo dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, we must add a strong acid. The process involves two key components:\n*   **Stoichiometric Reaction:** The acid (H⁺) neutralizes the hydroxide base to form water and dissolved iron(III) ions.\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Equilibrium Maintenance:** After the reaction, a certain amount of excess H⁺ must remain in the solution to keep the pH low enough to prevent the Fe³⁺ from reacting with water and re-precipitating as Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe total amount of acid added is the sum of the acid consumed in the reaction and the excess acid remaining in the final solution.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = (Molar Mass of Fe) + 3 × (Molar Mass of O + Molar Mass of H)\n*   Molar Mass ≈ 55.85 + 3 × (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\nNow, we calculate the moles in the 0.1 g sample.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n\n**3. Calculate the Moles of H⁺ Needed for the Reaction**\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺), we need 3 moles of H⁺ for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**4. Perform a Consistency Check on the Options**\n\nSince this is a multiple-choice question, the most reliable method is to check which option is self-consistent. For each option, we can calculate if the given volume of acid is the correct amount needed to both complete the reaction and establish the given final pH.\n\n**Let's test Option C: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n*   **Step 4a: Calculate the total moles of H⁺ added.**\n    The acid is 0.1 M and the volume is 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L).\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ added = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = 0.003009 mol.\n\n*   **Step 4b: Calculate the moles of excess H⁺ that would remain.**\n    This is the total acid added minus the acid consumed by the reaction.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (excess) = Total Moles H⁺ added - Moles H⁺ (reacted)\n    *   Moles H⁺ (excess) = 0.003009 mol - 0.002807 mol = 0.000202 mol.\n\n*   **Step 4c: Calculate the pH that this excess H⁺ would create.**\n    This excess acid is in the final solution volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   [H⁺] = Moles H⁺ (excess) / Final Volume\n    *   [H⁺] = 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\n    *   pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.00202) ≈ 2.695.\n\n*   **Step 4d: Compare.**\n    The calculated pH (2.695) is an excellent match for the pH given in Option C (2.69). This shows that Option C is internally consistent.\n\n**Checking Other Options (Briefly):**\n\n*   **Option D (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³):** The volume of acid (28.05 cm³) provides 0.002805 moles of H⁺. This is almost exactly the amount needed for the reaction (0.002807 mol), leaving virtually no excess acid. The pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺, which results in a pH of about 2.3, not 2.04. Thus, this option is inconsistent.\n*   **Option B (pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³):** Following the same consistency check, the 32.14 cm³ of acid would result in a pH of approximately 2.39, which does not match the given pH of 3.16.\n*   **Option A (pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³):** The 20.40 cm³ of acid is not even enough to complete the stoichiometric reaction, so this option is impossible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option where the volume of acid and the final pH are consistent with each other is Option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Chemical Processes**\n\nTo solve this problem, we must account for two distinct requirements for the added acid:\n*   **Stoichiometric Reaction:** The acid must provide enough H⁺ ions to neutralize and dissolve the solid Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Reaction: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Equilibrium Condition:** After dissolution, some excess H⁺ must remain in the solution to keep the final pH low enough to prevent the Fe(OH)₃ from precipitating back out. The total acid added is the sum of the acid used for the reaction and the acid remaining to set the final pH.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃ and the Stoichiometric Acid Requirement**\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** 55.845 (Fe) + 3 * (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** From the 1:3 stoichiometry of the reaction, we need 3 times the moles of H⁺ as Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * 0.0009357 mol = 0.002807 mol.\n\n**3. The \"Consistency Check\" Method**\n\nSince we are given multiple-choice options, the most reliable method is to check which option is internally consistent. For a given option (with a specific pH and volume), we can calculate if that volume of acid is exactly what's needed to both react with the Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to produce the given pH.\n\nLet's test **Option C: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**.\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate excess H⁺ needed for the given pH.**\n    *   The final pH is 2.69.\n    *   The concentration of H⁺ needed is [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   The total volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (remaining) = Concentration × Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol.\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the total H⁺ required.**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = 0.0030112 mol.\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed to provide this total.**\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Molarity\n    *   Volume = 0.0030112 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030112 L.\n    *   Converting to cm³: 0.030112 L × 1000 cm³/L = **30.11 cm³**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated volume of **30.11 cm³** is an excellent match for the volume given in Option C, which is **30.09 cm³**. The minor difference is due to rounding of physical constants. No other option demonstrates this internal consistency. For example, checking Option D (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³) would require a calculated volume of 37.2 cm³, which is a significant mismatch.\n\nTherefore, Option C is the only chemically and mathematically consistent answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the given volume of acid and the final pH are chemically consistent with each other.

The Consistency Check Method**\n\nSince we are given pairs of (pH, Volume) values, the most robust method is to check which pair is self-consistent. For each option, we can calculate the volume of acid that would be required to produce the given pH and see if it matches the volume given in that same option.\n\nThe formula for the total moles of H⁺ needed is:\nTotal Moles H⁺ = (Moles H⁺ for reaction) + (Moles H⁺ remaining for final pH)\n\nThe moles of H⁺ remaining in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution is:\nMoles H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺]final × Total Volume = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) × 0.1 L\n\nLet's test the options:\n\n*   **A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   The volume of acid needed for the reaction alone is (0.002807 mol / 0.1 M) * 1000 = 28.07 cm³. Since 20.40 cm³ is less than this, this option is impossible.\n\n*   **B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol (reaction) + 0.000204 mol (remaining) = 0.003011 mol\n    *   **Calculated Volume** = (0.003011 mol / 0.1 M) × 1000 cm³/L = **30.11 cm³**\n    *   This calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is an excellent match for the given volume (30.09 cm³).\n\n*   **C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   The volume of acid needed for the reaction alone is 28.07 cm³. Since 28.05 cm³ is less than this, this option is impossible.\n\n*   **D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000069 mol\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol (reaction) + 0.000069 mol (remaining) = 0.002876 mol\n    *   **Calculated Volume** = (0.002876 mol / 0.1 M) × 1000 cm³/L = **28.76 cm³**\n    *   This calculated volume (28.76 cm³) does not match the given volume (32.14 cm³).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly option B provides a consistent set of values. The volume of acid (30.09 cm³) is sufficient to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to establish a final pH of 2.69.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Chemical Process**\n\nTo dissolve iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, a sparingly soluble base, we must add a strong acid. The acid serves two purposes:\n*   **Stoichiometric Reaction:** It provides H⁺ ions to neutralize the hydroxide, causing the solid to dissolve according to the reaction: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l).\n*   **Maintaining Equilibrium:** It provides a sufficient concentration of excess H⁺ ions in the final solution to keep the pH low enough to prevent the Fe³⁺ from hydrolyzing and re-precipitating as Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe total amount of acid added must account for both of these requirements. The correct answer choice must present a pair of (pH, Volume) values that are self-consistent with this principle.\n\n**2. Calculate the Stoichiometric Acid Requirement**\n\nThis is the amount of acid needed just to complete the neutralization reaction.\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** 55.845 (Fe) + 3 * (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** From the 1:3 stoichiometry, we need 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol of H⁺.\n\n**3. The \"Test for Consistency\" Method**\n\nThe most reliable way to solve this multiple-choice problem is to check which of the given options is internally consistent. For each option, we assume the pH is correct and calculate the volume of acid that would be required. This calculated volume should match the volume given in the option.\n\n**Total Moles H⁺ Needed = (Moles for Reaction) + (Moles for Final pH)**\n*   Moles for Reaction = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol (calculated above).\n*   Moles for Final pH = [H⁺]final * V_total = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) * (0.1 L).\n*   **Required Volume (cm³) = (Total Moles H⁺ / 0.1 M) * 1000**\n\nLet's test the options:\n\n*   **A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   Moles for pH = (10⁻³.¹⁶) * 0.1 = 6.92 x 10⁻⁵ mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (6.92 x 10⁻⁵) = 2.876 x 10⁻³ mol.\n    *   Required Volume = (2.876 x 10⁻³ / 0.1) * 1000 = **28.76 cm³**.\n    *   This does **not** match the given volume of 32.14 cm³.\n\n*   **B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   Moles for pH = (10⁻².⁶⁹) * 0.1 = 2.04 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (2.04 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.011 x 10⁻³ mol.\n    *   Required Volume = (3.011 x 10⁻³ / 0.1) * 1000 = **30.11 cm³**.\n    *   This is an **excellent match** for the given volume of 30.09 cm³.\n\n*   **C) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   The volume of acid required for the reaction alone is 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 M = 28.07 cm³. The given volume of 20.40 cm³ is insufficient to even dissolve the solid. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   Moles for pH = (10⁻².⁰⁴) * 0.1 = 9.12 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (9.12 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.719 x 10⁻³ mol.\n    *   Required Volume = (3.719 x 10⁻³ / 0.1) * 1000 = **37.19 cm³**.\n    *   This does **not** match the given volume of 28.05 cm³.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe only option where the given pH and volume are consistent with the chemical requirements is B. Adding ~30.1 cm³ of the acid is sufficient to neutralize the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to establish a final pH of 2.69 in the 100 cm³ solution.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Chemical Process**\n\nThe problem involves dissolving a solid base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), using a strong acid. This process requires two considerations:\n*   **Stoichiometric Reaction:** A certain amount of acid is consumed to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃. The reaction is: `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`.\n*   **Equilibrium Condition:** To prevent the dissolved Fe³⁺ from precipitating back into Fe(OH)₃, the final solution must remain acidic. The amount of excess acid determines the final pH.\n\nThe total amount of acid added is the sum of the acid that reacted and the acid that remains to set the final pH.\n`Total Acid = Reacted Acid + Remaining (Excess) Acid`\n\n### **2. Calculate the Stoichiometric Acid Requirement**\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ ≈ 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n\nFrom the reaction stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ reacted = 3 * 0.0009356 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Options for Self-Consistency**\n\nThe most reliable way to solve this multiple-choice question is to test which option provides a consistent set of values. We can use the formula derived in Step 1: `Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)`.\n\nLet's test each option:\n\n**A) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:** Volume × Molarity = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **Moles H⁺ Remaining:** This is the amount of acid needed to achieve the final pH in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution.\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   Moles H⁺ remaining = [H⁺] × Volume = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n*   **Consistency Check:** Does `Total Moles H⁺` equal `Reacted Moles H⁺ + Remaining Moles H⁺`?\n    *   0.002807 mol (reacted) + 0.0002042 mol (remaining) = **0.0030112 mol**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The required total moles (0.0030112 mol) is an excellent match for the added moles (0.003009 mol). This option is self-consistent.\n\n**B) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:** 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = 0.003214 mol.\n*   **Moles H⁺ Remaining:** [H⁺] = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M ≈ 0.000692 M. Moles = 0.000692 M × 0.1 L = 0.0000692 mol.\n*   **Consistency Check:** 0.002807 mol (reacted) + 0.0000692 mol (remaining) = 0.0028762 mol.\n*   **Conclusion:** This does not match the added moles (0.003214 mol). Inconsistent.\n\n**C) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:** 0.02040 L × 0.1 M = 0.002040 mol.\n*   **Conclusion:** This is less than the 0.002807 moles required just for the reaction. This volume is insufficient to dissolve the solid. Inconsistent.\n\n**D) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:** 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = 0.002805 mol.\n*   **Moles H⁺ Remaining:** [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M ≈ 0.00912 M. Moles = 0.00912 M × 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.\n*   **Consistency Check:** 0.002807 mol (reacted) + 0.000912 mol (remaining) = 0.003719 mol.\n*   **Conclusion:** This does not match the added moles (0.002805 mol). Inconsistent.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nOnly option A presents a pair of values where the volume of acid is sufficient to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given final pH.

Test the Consistency of Each Option**\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ added must equal the moles reacted plus the moles remaining in the solution to create the final pH.\n`Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)`\n`Moles H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺]final * Volume = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) * (0.1 L)`\n\nLet's test **Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**.\n\n*   **Calculate moles of H⁺ remaining at pH 2.69:**\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = 0.002042 mol/L * 0.1 L ≈ **0.000204 mol**.\n\n*   **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ required:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol (reacted) + 0.000204 mol (remaining) = **0.003011 mol**.\n\n*   **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed to supply this total:**\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Molarity = 0.003011 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03011 L.\n    *   Volume in cm³ = 0.03011 L * 1000 cm³/L = **30.11 cm³**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated volume of **30.11 cm³** is an excellent match for the volume given in Option B (**30.09 cm³**). The minor difference is due to rounding of constants. Performing the same consistency check for the other options reveals significant mismatches between the given and calculated volumes. Therefore, Option B is the only self-consistent and correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the given volume of acid is consistent with the amount needed to both dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given final pH.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass = (Atomic Mass of Fe) + 3 × (Atomic Mass of O + Atomic Mass of H)\n*   Molar Mass ≈ 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**2. Understand the Acid Requirement**\n\nThe added strong acid (H⁺) serves two purposes:\n*   **Reaction:** It reacts stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃ to dissolve it.\n*   **Equilibrium:** An excess amount remains in the solution to maintain an acidic pH and prevent the Fe(OH)₃ from precipitating back out.\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ added must equal the sum of the moles used in the reaction and the moles remaining in the final solution.\n`Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)`\n\n**3. Calculate Moles of H⁺ for the Reaction**\n\nThe dissolution reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFrom the 1:3 stoichiometry, the moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction are:\n*   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n**4. Test the Options for Self-Consistency**\n\nWe will now test each option to see if the given volume of acid corresponds to the amount needed for the reaction plus the amount needed to create the given pH.\n\n*   **Test Option A: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   The volume of acid required for the reaction alone is (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 28.07 cm³.\n    *   The given volume of 28.05 cm³ is not even enough to complete the reaction, let alone provide excess acid to lower the pH to 2.04. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Test Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   **Moles H⁺ remaining:** The amount of H⁺ needed to achieve a pH of 2.69 in a 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution is:\n        *   [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 2.042 x 10⁻³ M\n        *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = Concentration × Volume = (2.042 x 10⁻³ mol/L) × 0.1 L = 2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n    *   **Total Moles H⁺ needed:**\n        *   Total Moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) + (2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 3.011 x 10⁻³ mol\n    *   **Calculated Volume of Acid:**\n        *   Volume = Total Moles / Molarity = (3.011 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.03011 L\n        *   Volume = 30.11 cm³\n    *   **Conclusion:** The calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is an excellent match for the given volume (30.09 cm³). This option is self-consistent.\n\n*   **Test Option C: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   The given volume of 20.40 cm³ is significantly less than the 28.07 cm³ required just for the reaction. The solid would not dissolve. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Test Option D: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   **Moles H⁺ remaining:**\n        *   [H⁺] = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M ≈ 6.918 x 10⁻⁴ M\n        *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = (6.918 x 10⁻⁴ mol/L) × 0.1 L = 6.918 x 10⁻⁵ mol\n    *   **Total Moles H⁺ needed:**\n        *   Total Moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) + (6.918 x 10⁻⁵ mol) = 2.876 x 10⁻³ mol\n    *   **Calculated Volume of Acid:**\n        *   Volume = (2.876 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.02876 L = 28.76 cm³\n    *   **Conclusion:** The calculated volume (28.76 cm³) does not match the given volume (32.14 cm³). This option is inconsistent.\n\nBased on the analysis, only Option B provides a pair of values where the volume of acid is consistent with the amount required to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the final pH.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python script was executed to determine the correct answer by checking the internal consistency of each multiple-choice option.\n\nFirst, the script calculated the moles of H⁺ required to stoichiometrically react with 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃, which was found to be `0.002807 mol`.\n\nThen, it tested each option:\n*   **Options A and B:** The provided acid volumes (20.40 cm³ and 28.05 cm³) were insufficient to supply the `0.002807 mol` of H⁺ needed for the initial reaction. Therefore, they could not be correct.\n*   **Option D:** The given volume of 32.14 cm³ would leave an excess of H⁺ that results in a calculated pH of 2.39. This does not match the given pH of 3.16.\n*   **Option C:** The given volume of 30.09 cm³ provides enough acid to complete the reaction and leaves an excess of H⁺. The code calculated that this excess would result in a pH of 2.70. This is an excellent match for the pH of 2.69 given in the option.\n\nThe analysis shows that only Option C provides a pair of values (pH and volume) that are chemically and mathematically consistent with each other.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Process**\n\nThe problem involves dissolving a sparingly soluble base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), using a strong acid. The total amount of acid added must be sufficient for two tasks:\n*   **Neutralization:** To react stoichiometrically with all the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   **Equilibrium:** To provide an excess of H⁺ ions that remain in the solution, lowering the pH enough to prevent the dissolved Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out as Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe overall chemical reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be Dissolved**\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = (Molar Mass of Fe) + 3 × (Molar Mass of O + Molar Mass of H)\n*   Molar Mass ≈ 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the Moles of H⁺ Consumed in the Reaction**\n\nFrom the reaction's stoichiometry (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺), we know that 3 moles of H⁺ are consumed for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ (consumed) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ (consumed) = 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol\n\n**4. Test the Options for Self-Consistency**\n\nThis is the most robust method to solve the problem, as it avoids uncertainties related to the exact value of the solubility product constant (Ksp). We will check if the given volume of acid in each option is consistent with the amount needed to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given pH.\n\nThe governing equation is:\n**Total Moles of H⁺ Added = Moles of H⁺ Consumed + Moles of H⁺ Remaining**\n\nWhere:\n*   Total Moles of H⁺ Added = Volume of Acid (L) × 0.1 mol/L\n*   Moles of H⁺ Consumed ≈ 0.002807 mol (calculated above)\n*   Moles of H⁺ Remaining = Final [H⁺] × Final Volume (L) = 10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L\n\nLet's test each option:\n\n**A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.0204 L)**\n*   Total H⁺ added = 0.0204 L × 0.1 M = 0.00204 mol.\n*   This amount (0.00204 mol) is less than the amount needed just for the reaction (0.002807 mol). Therefore, this option is incorrect as not all the Fe(OH)₃ would dissolve.\n\n**B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n*   Total H⁺ added = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   Total H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol (consumed) + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L)\n*   Total H⁺ needed = 0.002807 + (0.002042 × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.0002042 = **0.0030112 mol**.\n*   The amount of acid added (0.003009 mol) is an excellent match for the amount of acid needed (0.0030112 mol). The minor difference is due to rounding. This option is self-consistent.\n\n**C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n*   Total H⁺ added = 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = 0.002805 mol.\n*   This amount is almost exactly what is needed for the reaction alone (0.002807 mol), leaving virtually no excess acid. However, to achieve a pH of 2.04, a significant amount of excess acid is required: Moles remaining = 10⁻².⁰⁴ × 0.1 = 0.000912 mol. This option is inconsistent.\n\n**D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n*   Total H⁺ added = 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = **0.003214 mol**.\n*   Total H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol (consumed) + (10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L)\n*   Total H⁺ needed = 0.002807 + (0.0000692) = **0.002876 mol**.\n*   The amount of acid added (0.003214 mol) does not match the amount needed (0.002876 mol). This option is inconsistent.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly option B provides a pair of pH and volume values that are chemically and mathematically consistent with the conditions of the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the given volume of acid and the final pH are chemically consistent with each other. The most reliable method is to test each option.\n\nThe overall process involves two components for the added acid:\n1.  **Stoichiometric Reaction:** The acid must first neutralize the iron(III) hydroxide.\n2.  **Equilibrium Maintenance:** An excess of acid must remain in the solution to keep the final pH low enough to prevent the dissolved iron ions from precipitating back out.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃ and the Stoichiometric Acid Requirement**\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Fe ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n    *   O ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   H ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n*   **The Neutralization Reaction:**\n    *   Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** From the 1:3 stoichiometry, we need 3 times the moles of H⁺.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 * 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Test Each Option for Consistency**\n\nWe will now check if the volume of acid in each option is the correct amount needed to both complete the reaction (Step 1) and leave enough excess H⁺ to create the specified pH in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) volume.\n\n**General Formula:**\nTotal Moles H⁺ = (Moles H⁺ for reaction) + (Moles H⁺ remaining for pH)\nVolume of Acid (cm³) = (Total Moles H⁺ / 0.1 M) * 1000\n\n---\n\n**A) Test Option A: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n*   Moles H⁺ remaining = [H⁺] * V = (10⁻³.¹⁶ M) * 0.1 L ≈ 0.000069 mol.\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = 0.002876 mol.\n*   Calculated Volume = (0.002876 mol / 0.1 M) * 1000 = 28.76 cm³.\n*   This does **not** match the given volume of 32.14 cm³.\n\n**B) Test Option B: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n*   The acid volume required for the reaction alone is ~28.07 cm³. The given volume of 20.40 cm³ is insufficient to even dissolve all the Fe(OH)₃. This option is impossible.\n\n**C) Test Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   Moles H⁺ remaining = [H⁺] * V = (10⁻².⁰⁴ M) * 0.1 L ≈ 0.000912 mol.\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = 0.003719 mol.\n*   Calculated Volume = (0.003719 mol / 0.1 M) * 1000 = 37.19 cm³.\n*   This does **not** match the given volume of 28.05 cm³.\n\n**D) Test Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   Moles H⁺ remaining = [H⁺] * V = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) * 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol.\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = 0.003011 mol.\n*   Calculated Volume = (0.003011 mol / 0.1 M) * 1000 = **30.11 cm³**.\n*   This calculated volume of 30.11 cm³ is an excellent match for the given volume of **30.09 cm³**. The minor difference is due to rounding.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly Option D provides a pair of values where the volume of acid is consistent with the amount required to both dissolve the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and establish the final pH of 2.69.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
