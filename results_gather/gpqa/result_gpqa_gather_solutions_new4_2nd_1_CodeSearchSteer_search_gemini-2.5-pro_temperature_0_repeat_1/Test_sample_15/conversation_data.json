A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane.

Such a molecule with defined chiral centers is chiral, and as a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the molecule's structure is symmetrical, and the (2R, 3S) configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion in certain conformations). This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound.

This carbon is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and two different pathways around the ring. The name refers to a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This notation describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This highly symmetrical arrangement results in multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane can pass through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. The presence of symmetry planes makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the number of optically active compounds, we must analyze each molecule for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a 50:50 mixture of its enantiomers (a racemic mixture). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of achirality are the presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms involved in and directly attached to the double bond lie in a single plane. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers in a complex molecule. Naming a specific enantiomer like this implies the compound is chiral and is not a racemic mixture. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, with identical groups at either end. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, which makes the molecule achiral. This is a classic example of a meso compound. Meso compounds are **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The `(R)` in the name specifies the configuration at a chiral center. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a chiral center because it is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and two different pathways around the ring (`-CH=CH-CH2-` and `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). As a single, specified enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This notation describes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis). This highly symmetric molecule possesses three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. Due to the presence of these symmetry planes, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. To check for chirality, we look for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group, and two identical methyl groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule lacks any chiral centers and is achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine the number of optically active compounds, each molecule must be analyzed for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a 50:50 mixture of its mirror images (a racemic mixture). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key indicators of achirality (and thus optical inactivity) are the presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry. Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS). This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer of a complex molecule with chiral centers. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. The molecule's complex, bridged structure lacks any internal symmetry. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, with identical groups (COOH and CH3) attached to both chiral centers. The (2R,3S) configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, which makes the molecule achiral despite the presence of chiral centers. This is a classic example of a meso compound. Meso compounds are superimposable on their mirror images and are **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable (2S,3S) enantiomer. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the (R) configuration at carbon 1. This carbon is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group (-OH), and two different pathways within the ring (-CH=CH-CH2- and -CH2-CH2-). As a single, specified enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This notation describes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis). This highly symmetric arrangement results in multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane can pass through one C-OH group and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. To be chiral, a molecule typically needs a chiral center. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the chain. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. No other atom in the molecule is a chiral center, and the molecule is achiral.

A simple way to test for achirality is to look for elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer with defined configurations at its chiral centers. Such a complex, bridged molecule is not a meso compound (i.e., it lacks internal symmetry). A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3) and a symmetrical structure (`HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`). The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry between the two chiral centers. A compound that has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to internal symmetry is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are not optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. The molecule is chiral, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The `(R)` in the name specifies a single enantiomer. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a chiral center because it is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and two different pathways around the ring (`-CH=CH-` and `-CH2-CH2-`). As a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This notation describes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis). This highly symmetrical arrangement results in multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane can pass through any C-OH group and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. To check for chirality, we look for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Final Count:**\nBased on the analysis, the following three compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we must analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of an achiral molecule are the presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms involved in and directly attached to the double bond lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. Since it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer with defined configurations at its chiral centers. A single enantiomer of a complex, asymmetric molecule like this is by definition chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3) and identical groups at both ends (`-COOH`). The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that lies between the two chiral carbons. A compound that has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to internal symmetry is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. As the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The `(R)` designation specifies a single enantiomer. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a chiral center because it is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and two distinct paths around the ring (`-CH=CH-CH2-` and `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This notation describes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis). This highly symmetric arrangement results in multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane can pass through any C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: To check for chirality, we look for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the chain. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule lacks any chiral centers and is achiral, making it **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting the compounds that are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

The consensus from the provided answers is based on a consistent application of stereochemistry principles.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Optical Activity:** A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers (a racemic mixture). The problem names specific stereoisomers, implying they are not racemic.\n2.  **Chirality:** The fundamental requirement for optical activity is chirality. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n3.  **Achirality:** A molecule is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of an internal element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i), makes a molecule achiral and thus optically inactive.\n4.  **Chiral Centers:** A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a chiral center. While a common source of chirality, the presence of chiral centers does not guarantee the entire molecule is chiral.\n5.  **Meso Compounds:** These are achiral molecules that contain multiple chiral centers but are achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.

The structure lacks internal symmetry. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3) but is structurally symmetric. The `(2R,3S)` configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

However, the molecule is symmetric, with identical groups at either end (`-CH(CH3)COOH`). The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry (in some conformations) or a center of inversion (in others), which makes the molecule achiral. This is a classic example of a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above.

Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at carbon 1. This carbon is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and two different pathways around the ring (`-CH=CH-CH2-` and `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). As a single, specified enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis). This highly symmetric molecule possesses three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. The presence of these symmetry planes makes the molecule achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. To be chiral, a molecule typically needs a chiral center. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the chain.

A molecule with chiral centers that is achiral due to internal symmetry is called a meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive** (it is a meso compound).\n\n**4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Analysis**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n*   **Conclusion**: Optically **active**.\n\n**5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n*   **Analysis**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1, which is a chiral center. C1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and two different pathways around the ring (`-CH=CH-CH2-` and `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). As a single, specified enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is optically active.\n*   **Conclusion**: Optically **active**.\n\n**6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n*   **Analysis**: This notation typically refers to the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This highly symmetric molecule possesses three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the CH2 group directly opposite it. The presence of these symmetry planes makes the molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n**7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. To be chiral, it must lack internal symmetry, which usually requires a chiral center. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. The molecule is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Final Count:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n1.

A compound will exhibit optical activity if its molecular structure is chiral and it is not present as a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers (a racemic mixture). The question specifies particular stereoisomers for many of the compounds, so we can assume they are not racemic. The key is to identify which of these specified molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A simple way to test for achirality is to look for elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer with defined configurations at its chiral centers. Such a complex, bridged molecule is not a meso compound (i.e., it lacks internal symmetry). A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3) and a symmetrical structure (`HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`). The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry between the two chiral centers. A compound that has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to internal symmetry is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are not optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. The molecule is chiral, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The `(R)` in the name specifies a single enantiomer. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a chiral center because it is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and two different pathways around the ring (`-CH=CH-` and `-CH2-CH2-`). As a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This notation describes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis). This highly symmetrical arrangement results in multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane can pass through any C-OH group and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. To check for chirality, we look for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Final Count:**\nBased on the analysis, the following three compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we must analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of an achiral molecule are the presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms involved in and directly attached to the double bond lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. Since it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer with defined configurations at its chiral centers. A single enantiomer of a complex, asymmetric molecule like this is by definition chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3) and identical groups at both ends (`-COOH`). The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that lies between the two chiral carbons. A compound that has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to internal symmetry is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. As the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The `(R)` designation specifies a single enantiomer. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a chiral center because it is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and two distinct paths around the ring (`-CH=CH-CH2-` and `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This notation describes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis). This highly symmetric arrangement results in multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane can pass through any C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: To check for chirality, we look for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the chain. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule lacks any chiral centers and is achiral, making it **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting the compounds that are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
