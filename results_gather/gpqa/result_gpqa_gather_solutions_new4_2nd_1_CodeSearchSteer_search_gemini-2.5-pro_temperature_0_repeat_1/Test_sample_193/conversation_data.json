Define the System and its States**\n*   The system has three spins: S₁, S₂, and S₃.\n*   Each spin can be either +1 or -1.\n*   The total number of possible configurations (microstates) is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Define the Energy and Partition Function**\n*   The energy of a given state is E = -J[S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃].\n*   The partition function is Z = Σ_states e^(-βE), where the sum is over all 8 microstates.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy for All States**\nA systematic way to do this is to list all 8 states and calculate the energy for each.\n\n| State Configuration (S₁, S₂, S₃) | Sum of Products (S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃) | Energy E = -J × (Sum) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| (+1, +1, +1) | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | -3J |\n| (+1, +1, -1) | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (+1, -1, +1) | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (-1, +1, +1) | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (+1, -1, -1) | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (-1, +1, -1) | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (-1, -1, +1) | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (-1, -1, -1) | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | -3J |\n\n**4. Group States by Energy Level (Degeneracy)**\nFrom the table, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy Level E₁ = -3J**: This energy occurs when all spins are aligned.\n    *   States: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The number of states with this energy (degeneracy) is **g₁ = 2**.\n\n*   **Energy Level E₂ = +J**: This energy occurs when one spin is flipped relative to the other two.\n    *   States: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1).\n    *   The number of states with this energy (degeneracy) is **g₂ = 6**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The sum of the degeneracies must equal the total number of states: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8.

This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy for Each State**: The energy is given by the Hamiltonian E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We will calculate the energy for all 8 states. A clear way to do this is with a table.\n\n| State Configuration (S1, S2, S3) | S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 | Energy (E = -J * Sum) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| (+1, +1, +1) | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | -3J |\n| (-1, -1, -1) | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | -3J |\n| (+1, +1, -1) | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (+1, -1, +1) | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (-1, +1, +1) | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (+1, -1, -1) | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (-1, +1, -1) | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (-1, -1, +1) | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | +J |\n\n3.  **Group States by Energy and Find Degeneracy**: From the table, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels. The number of states corresponding to each energy level is its degeneracy (g).\n\n*   **Energy Level E₁ = -3J**: This occurs for 2 states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1). The degeneracy is **g₁ = 2**.\n*   **Energy Level E₂ = +J**: This occurs for the remaining 6 states. The degeneracy is **g₂ = 6**.\n\n4.  **Construct the Partition Function (Z)**: The partition function is the sum over all energy levels of the degeneracy multiplied by the Boltzmann factor.\n    Z = g₁ * e<sup>-βE₁</sup> + g₂ * e<sup>-βE₂</sup>\n\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    Z = 2 * e<sup>-β(-3J)</sup> + 6 * e<sup>-β(+J)</sup>\n    Z = 2e<sup>3Jβ</sup> + 6e<sup>-Jβ</sup>\n\n### Careful Points and Common Errors\n\n*   **Sign of Energy**: The leading negative sign in the energy formula E = **-J**[...] is crucial.\n*   **Sign in Exponent**: The Boltzmann factor is e<sup>**-βE**</sup>. A common mistake is to forget this negative sign. When the energy E is negative (like -3J), the two negatives cancel, resulting in a positive exponent (e<sup>3Jβ</sup>). This is the most frequent error seen in the candidate answers.\n*   **Degeneracy Check**: The sum of the degeneracies (g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8) must equal the total number of microstates, confirming that all states have been accounted for.\n*   **Matching to Options**: After deriving the correct formula, it is essential to carefully match it to the given choices. Several candidate answers derived the correct formula but selected the wrong option letter.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOur derived partition function is **Z = 2e<sup>3Jβ</sup> + 6e<sup>-Jβ</sup>**.

The most systematic way to find the partition function is to list all 8 states, calculate the energy for each, and then group them by energy level.\n\nA table is the best tool for this to avoid errors:\n\n| State # | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 | Energy E = -J * (Sum) |\n|:-------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:---------------------:|:-----------------------:|\n| 1       | +1 | +1 | +1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3         | -3J                     |\n| 2       | +1 | +1 | -1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1        | +J                      |\n| 3       | +1 | -1 | +1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1       | +J                      |\n| 4       | -1 | +1 | +1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1       | +J                      |\n| 5       | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1       | +J                      |\n| 6       | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1       | +J                      |\n| 7       | -1 | -1 | +1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1        | +J                      |\n| 8       | -1 | -1 | -1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3         | -3J                     |\n\n### Step 3: Group States by Energy Level (Find Degeneracy)\nFrom the table, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy Level 1: E₁ = -3J**\n    *   This energy corresponds to the two states where all spins are aligned: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The degeneracy (number of states) for this level is **g₁ = 2**.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2: E₂ = +J**\n    *   This energy corresponds to the six states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two.\n    *   The degeneracy for this level is **g₂ = 6**.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** A quick check confirms we have accounted for all states, as the sum of degeneracies is g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8.\n\n### Step 4: Construct the Partition Function\nThe partition function Z is the sum over the energy levels, with each term weighted by its degeneracy:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n\nSubstitute the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Pay close attention to the signs in the exponent. The formula has a negative sign, `e^(-βE)`. When the energy E is negative (E₁ = -3J), the two negative signs cancel, resulting in a positive exponent.\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Given Options\nThe calculated expression is `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`.

However, several of them made a simple error in the final step by matching this correct expression to the wrong letter (e.g., C or D).

Then, Z = Σ_levels g_i * e^(-βE_i), where g_i is the degeneracy of the energy level E_i.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: List all 8 possible states and calculate their energies.**\n\nWe can categorize the states by how many spins are \"up\" (+1) versus \"down\" (-1).\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   State (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   State (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   State (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   State (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   State (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n\n**Step B: Group states by energy level and find their degeneracy.**\n\nFrom the calculations above, we find two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy Level 1: E₁ = -3J**\n    *   This occurs when all three spins are aligned.\n    *   The degeneracy (number of states) for this energy level is **g₁ = 2**.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2: E₂ = +J**\n    *   This occurs for all other states where one spin is flipped.\n    *   The degeneracy for this energy level is **g₂ = 6**.\n\n**Careful Point:** A good check is that the sum of degeneracies must equal the total number of states: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8. This is correct.\n\n**Step C: Construct the Partition Function Z.**\n\nNow, we use the formula Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂).\n\n*   Contribution from E₁ = -3J:\n    *   2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) = **2e^(3Jβ)**\n\n*   Contribution from E₂ = +J:\n    *   6 * e^(-β * (+J)) = **6e^(-Jβ)**\n\n**Careful Point:** Pay close attention to the signs in the exponent.

Group States by Energy Level (Find Degeneracy)**\nFrom the table, we can see there are only two distinct energy values. The number of states corresponding to each energy value is its degeneracy (g).\n\n*   **Energy Level 1 (E₁):** E₁ = -3J\n    *   This energy corresponds to the states where all spins are aligned: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The degeneracy is **g₁ = 2**.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2 (E₂):** E₂ = +J\n    *   This energy corresponds to all the other states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two.\n    *   There are **g₂ = 6** such states.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The sum of the degeneracies must equal the total number of states: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8. This confirms we have accounted for all states.\n\n**5. Construct the Partition Function**\nNow we use the formula Z = Σ gᵢ * exp(-βEᵢ), summing over the unique energy levels.\n\nZ = g₁ * exp(-βE₁) + g₂ * exp(-βE₂)\n\nSubstitute the values we found:\nZ = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * (+J))\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Pay close attention to the signs in the exponent. The term `exp(-βE₁)` becomes `exp(-β * -3J)`, which simplifies to `exp(3Jβ)`.\n\nThe final expression is:\nZ = 2exp(3Jβ) + 6exp(-Jβ)\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\nLet's compare our result with the given choices:\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)  (Incorrect signs in exponents)\nB) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)  (Incorrect energies and degeneracies)\nC) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)  (**Correct match**)\nD) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)  (Incorrect energies)\n\nThe calculation correctly and unambiguously leads to option C. Many of the provided candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed in the final step of matching their result to the options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a strong consensus on the calculation method and the resulting mathematical expression for the partition function, Z. However, there are numerous errors in matching this final expression to the correct multiple-choice option.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the States**: The system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), each with two possible values (+1 or -1). This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates.\n\n2.  **Define the Energy Function**: The energy for any given state is `E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Energy for All States**: We must calculate the energy for each of the 8 states. A systematic way is to group them by the number of \"up\" (+1) and \"down\" (-1) spins.\n\n    *   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n        *   State (+1, +1, +1): `S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = 1+1+1 = 3`. So, `E = -J(3) = -3J`.\n        *   State (-1, -1, -1): `S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = 1+1+1 = 3`. So, `E = -J(3) = -3J`.\n        *   **Careful Point 1**: The energy is the same whether all spins are up or all are down. This gives an energy level of **E₁ = -3J** with a degeneracy (number of states) of **g₁ = 2**.\n\n    *   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n        *   Let's test state (+1, +1, -1): `S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = 1-1-1 = -1`. So, `E = -J(-1) = +J`.\n        *   Let's test state (+1, -1, -1): `S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = -1-1+1 = -1`. So, `E = -J(-1) = +J`.\n        *   **Careful Point 2**: Any state with one spin different from the other two will have the same energy. There are 3 ways to have one spin down and two up `(+,+,-), (+,-,+), (-,+,+)`, and 3 ways to have one spin up and two down `(+,-,-), (-,+,-), (-,-,+)`.\n        *   This gives a second energy level of **E₂ = +J** with a degeneracy of **g₂ = 3 + 3 = 6**.\n\n4.  **Construct the Partition Function**: The partition function `Z` is the sum over all energy levels of the degeneracy multiplied by the Boltzmann factor.\n    `Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)`\n\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    `Z = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))`\n\n    **Careful Point 3**: Pay close attention to the signs in the exponent. The negative sign in the Boltzmann factor `e^(-βE)` cancels with the negative sign in the energy `E₁ = -3J`.\n    `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**:\n    *   A) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta) - Incorrect energies.\n    *   B) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta) - Incorrect signs in exponents.\n    *   C) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta) - Incorrect energies and degeneracies swapped.\n    *   D) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta) - **This matches our result.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly derive the expression `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`.

The correct derivation leads directly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the System and its States\nThe system consists of three spins: S₁, S₂, and S₃. Each spin can be in one of two states: +1 (up) or -1 (down). The total number of possible configurations (microstates) for the system is therefore 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Energy and Partition Function\nThe energy of a given state is defined by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ ]\n\nThe partition function, Z, is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e<sup>-βE</sup>, over all possible microstates:\nZ = Σ<sub>states</sub> e<sup>-βE</sup>\n\nA more efficient way to calculate this is to find the unique energy levels and their degeneracy (the number of states, g, with that energy). The formula then becomes:\nZ = Σ<sub>levels</sub> gᵢ * e<sup>-βEᵢ</sup>\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Energy for All 8 States\nWe must systematically list all 8 states and calculate the energy for each.\n\n| State | S₁ | S₂ | S₃ | S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ | Energy (E = -J * Sum) |\n| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | +1 | +1 | +1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | **-3J** |\n| 2 | -1 | -1 | -1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | **-3J** |\n| 3 | +1 | +1 | -1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | **+J** |\n| 4 | +1 | -1 | +1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | **+J** |\n| 5 | -1 | +1 | +1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | **+J** |\n| 6 | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | **+J** |\n| 7 | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | **+J** |\n| 8 | -1 | -1 | +1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | **+J** |\n\n### Step 4: Group States by Energy Level (Find Degeneracy)\nFrom the table, we can identify two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy Level 1: E₁ = -3J**\n    *   This occurs when all spins are aligned (all up or all down).\n    *   The degeneracy (number of states) is **g₁ = 2**.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2: E₂ = +J**\n    *   This occurs for all other states, where one spin is flipped relative to the other two.\n    *   The degeneracy (number of states) is **g₂ = 6**.\n\nA quick check confirms that the sum of degeneracies equals the total number of states: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8.\n\n### Step 5: Construct the Partition Function\nNow we use the formula Z = g₁ * e<sup>-βE₁</sup> + g₂ * e<sup>-βE₂</sup>.\n\n*   **Term 1:** For the energy level E₁ = -3J with g₁ = 2:\n    *   2 * e<sup>-β(-3J)</sup> = 2 * e<sup>3Jβ</sup>\n\n*   **Term 2:** For the energy level E₂ = +J with g₂ = 6:\n    *   6 * e<sup>-β(+J)</sup> = 6 * e<sup>-Jβ</sup>\n\nAdding the terms together gives the final partition function:\nZ = 2e<sup>3Jβ</sup> + 6e<sup>-Jβ</sup>\n\n### Careful Points and Common Errors\n*   **Sign in Energy Formula:** The energy is E = **-J**[...]. Forgetting this negative sign is a common error.\n*   **Sign in Exponent:** The Boltzmann factor is e<sup>**-β**E</sup>. This negative sign is also crucial.\n*   **Double Negative:** For the E = -3J energy level, the exponent becomes -β(-3J) = +3Jβ. Failing to cancel the two negative signs is a frequent mistake.\n*   **Matching to Options:** After correctly deriving the formula Z = 2e<sup>3Jβ</sup> + 6e<sup>-Jβ</sup>, it is essential to carefully match it to the given choices. Several of the provided candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but then selected the wrong option.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculated partition function is Z = 2e<sup>3Jβ</sup> + 6e<sup>-Jβ</sup>.

The process involves enumerating all possible states of the system, calculating the energy for each state, grouping states by energy level to find their degeneracy, and finally summing the Boltzmann factors for each energy level.\n\n**Step 1: Define the System and its States**\nThe system has three spins: S₁, S₂, and S₃. Each spin can be in one of two states: +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates for the entire system.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Energy and Partition Function**\nThe energy of a given state is defined by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ ]\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all 8 states of the Boltzmann factor e<sup>-βE</sup>:\nZ = Σ<sub>states</sub> e<sup>-βE</sup>\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Energy for All Possible States**\nWe can systematically list all 8 states and calculate their corresponding energies. A table is useful for this.\n\n| State (S₁, S₂, S₃) | S₁S₂ | S₁S₃ | S₂S₃ | Sum (S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃) | Energy E = -J × (Sum) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| (+1, +1, +1) | +1 | +1 | +1 | +3 | **-3J** |\n| (-1, -1, -1) | +1 | +1 | +1 | +3 | **-3J** |\n| (+1, +1, -1) | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | **+J** |\n| (+1, -1, +1) | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 | **+J** |\n| (-1, +1, +1) | -1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | **+J** |\n| (+1, -1, -1) | -1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | **+J** |\n| (-1, +1, -1) | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 | **+J** |\n| (-1, -1, +1) | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | **+J** |\n\n**Careful Point 1: Energy Calculation.** It is crucial to correctly calculate the sum of the products for each state. For states where all spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1), the product of any two spins is +1, so the sum is 1+1+1=3. For states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two, there will be one (+1) product and two (-1) products, so the sum is -1. The energy is `-J` times this sum, which inverts the sign.\n\n**Step 4: Group States by Energy Level (Degeneracy)**\nFrom the table, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels:\n*   **Energy Level E₁ = -3J**: This level corresponds to the two states where all spins are aligned: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1). The degeneracy (number of states) is **g₁ = 2**.\n*   **Energy Level E₂ = +J**: This level corresponds to the six states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two. The degeneracy is **g₂ = 6**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Accounting for All States.** The sum of the degeneracies must equal the total number of states: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8. This confirms that all states have been accounted for.\n\n**Step 5: Construct the Partition Function**\nThe partition function is the sum of the contributions from each energy level, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g₁e<sup>-βE₁</sup> + g₂e<sup>-βE₂</sup>\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 × e<sup>-β(-3J)</sup> + 6 × e<sup>-β(+J)</sup>\n\n**Careful Point 3: Signs in the Exponent.** The formula for the Boltzmann factor has a negative sign, e<sup>-βE</sup>. When the energy E is itself negative (E₁ = -3J), the two negative signs cancel, resulting in a positive exponent.\nZ = 2e<sup>3Jβ</sup> + 6e<sup>-Jβ</sup>\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Options**\nThe calculated expression is Z = 2e<sup>3Jβ</sup> + 6e<sup>-Jβ</sup>. Let's compare this to the given choices:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nThe calculated result matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Objective**: To find the partition function Z for a system of three spins with energy E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e<sup>-βE</sup>, over all possible microstates of the system.\nZ = Σ<sub>states</sub> e<sup>-βE</sup>\n\n### Step 1: Identify All Possible States and Their Energies\n\nThe system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each can be +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates. We must calculate the energy for each one.\n\nA systematic way to do this is to group the states by the number of \"up\" (+1) and \"down\" (-1) spins.\n\n**Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n*   State 1: (+1, +1, +1) -> E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n*   State 2: (-1, -1, -1) -> E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n\n**Careful Point:** The energy depends on the product of the spins. Since (-1) * (-1) = +1, the all-down state has the same energy as the all-up state.\n\n**Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\nThis covers all remaining states. Let's calculate the energy for one example from this group.\n*   State 3: (+1, +1, -1) -> E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n\n**Careful Point:** By symmetry, any state with two spins in one direction and the third in the opposite direction will have the same energy. We can verify this for a state with two down spins and one up spin:\n*   State 4: (+1, -1, -1) -> E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n\nAll 6 states in this category have the same energy, +J. These states are:\n(+,+,-), (+,-,+), (-,+,+), (+,-,-), (-,+,-), (-,-,+)\n\n### Step 2: Group States by Energy Level (Find Degeneracy)\n\nFrom the calculations above, we have two distinct energy levels:\n\n1.  **Energy Level E₁ = -3J**: This level has 2 states. Its degeneracy is **g₁ = 2**.\n2.  **Energy Level E₂ = +J**: This level has 6 states. Its degeneracy is **g₂ = 6**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The sum of the degeneracies must equal the total number of states. Here, g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8, which confirms we have accounted for all possible microstates.\n\n### Step 3: Construct the Partition Function\n\nThe partition function can be written as a sum over the unique energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g₁ * e<sup>-βE₁</sup> + g₂ * e<sup>-βE₂</sup>\n\nNow, we substitute the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e<sup>-β(-3J)</sup> + 6 * e<sup>-β(+J)</sup>\n\n**Careful Point:** Pay close attention to the signs in the exponents. The formula for the Boltzmann factor has a negative sign, e<sup>-βE</sup>. When the energy E is itself negative (like E₁ = -3J), the two negatives cancel.\nZ = 2e<sup>3Jβ</sup> + 6e<sup>-Jβ</sup>\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options\n\nThe calculated partition function is **Z = 2e<sup>3Jβ</sup> + 6e<sup>-Jβ</sup>**.\n\nLet's compare this to the options provided:\nA) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nB) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nOur result exactly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "An analysis of the provided answers reveals a strong consensus on the calculation method and the resulting mathematical expression for the partition function, Z. The discrepancies arise almost entirely from the final step of matching the correct expression to the corresponding multiple-choice letter.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the System's States**: The system has three spins (S₁, S₂, S₃), and each can take a value of +1 or -1.

The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e<sup>-βE</sup>, over all 8 states:\n    Z = Σ<sub>states</sub> e<sup>-βE</sup>\n\n3.  **Calculate Energy Levels and Their Degeneracy**: The most efficient method is to group states by their configuration and find the energy for each group.\n\n    *   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n        *   State (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(3) = **-3J**\n        *   State (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = **-3J**\n        *   These two states have the same energy. Thus, the energy level is **E₁ = -3J** with a degeneracy (number of states) of **g₁ = 2**.\n\n    *   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n        *   This category includes all the remaining 6 states. We can test a representative state, such as (+1, +1, -1):\n        *   State (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = **+J**\n        *   By symmetry, all 6 states in this group have the same energy. The states are (+, +, -), (+, -, +), (-, +, +), (+, -, -), (-, +, -), and (-, -, +).\n        *   Thus, the second energy level is **E₂ = +J** with a degeneracy of **g₂ = 6**.\n\n4.  **Construct the Partition Function**: The partition function is the sum over the unique energy levels, with each term weighted by its degeneracy:\n    Z = g₁ * e<sup>-βE₁</sup> + g₂ * e<sup>-βE₂</sup>\n\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    Z = 2 * e<sup>-β(-3J)</sup> + 6 * e<sup>-β(+J)</sup>\n\n    Simplifying the exponents gives the final expression:\n    Z = 2e<sup>3Jβ</sup> + 6e<sup>-Jβ</sup>\n\n### Careful Points and Common Errors\n\n*   **Energy Calculation**: The leading negative sign in the energy formula, E = **-J**[...], is crucial. Furthermore, one must remember that the product of two negative spins is positive, which is why the all-up and all-down states have the same energy.\n*   **Boltzmann Factor Sign**: The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is **-βE**. This negative sign must be included.\n*   **Double Negative Cancellation**: For the E₁ = -3J energy level, the exponent becomes -β(-3J) = +3Jβ. Failing to cancel the two negative signs is a very common mistake.\n*   **Degeneracy Check**: The sum of the degeneracies must equal the total number of states (g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8). This confirms all states have been accounted for.\n*   **Matching to Options**: After deriving the correct expression, `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`, it must be carefully matched to the original list of options.

Then, Z = Σ_levels g_i * e^(-βE_i), where g_i is the degeneracy of the energy level E_i.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: List all 8 possible states and calculate their energies.**\n\nWe can categorize the states by how many spins are \"up\" (+1) versus \"down\" (-1).\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   State (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   State (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   State (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   State (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   State (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n\n**Step B: Group states by energy level and find their degeneracy.**\n\nFrom the calculations above, we find two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy Level 1: E₁ = -3J**\n    *   This occurs when all three spins are aligned.\n    *   The degeneracy (number of states) for this energy level is **g₁ = 2**.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2: E₂ = +J**\n    *   This occurs for all other states where one spin is flipped.\n    *   The degeneracy for this energy level is **g₂ = 6**.\n\n**Careful Point:** A good check is that the sum of degeneracies must equal the total number of states: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8. This is correct.\n\n**Step C: Construct the Partition Function Z.**\n\nNow, we use the formula Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂).\n\n*   Contribution from E₁ = -3J:\n    *   2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) = **2e^(3Jβ)**\n\n*   Contribution from E₂ = +J:\n    *   6 * e^(-β * (+J)) = **6e^(-Jβ)**\n\n**Careful Point:** Pay close attention to the signs in the exponent. The formula has a negative sign, `e^(-βE)`. When the energy E is negative (like -3J), the two negatives cancel, resulting in a positive exponent `e^(3Jβ)`.\n\n**Step D: Combine the terms to get the final answer.**\n\nAdding the contributions from all energy levels gives the total partition function:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**Step E: Compare with the given options.**\n\n*   A) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n*   B) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n*   C) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n*   D) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated result, Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ), perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct partition function.\n\n### Step 1: Define the System and its States\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. The total number of possible configurations (microstates) for the system is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Energy and Partition Function\nThe energy of the system for a given state is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nThe partition function, Z, is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all 8 possible microstates:\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\nA more efficient method is to group states by their energy level and use the formula:\nZ = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)\nwhere g(E) is the degeneracy, i.e., the number of states with a specific energy E.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Energies and Degeneracies\nWe must systematically list all 8 states and calculate their energies.\n\n**Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n*   State (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = **-3J**\n*   State (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = **-3J**\n\nThere are **2** states with an energy of E₁ = -3J. The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n**Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\nThis includes configurations with two spins up and one down, and one spin up and two down.\n*   State (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = **+J**\n*   State (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = **+J**\n*   State (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = -J(-1) = **+J**\n*   State (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = -J(-1) = **+J**\n*   State (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = **+J**\n*   State (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = **+J**\n\nThere are **6** states with an energy of E₂ = +J.

This is a common point of error.\n4.  **Degeneracy Check:** The sum of the degeneracies (g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8) must equal the total number of microstates, which it does.\n5.  **Matching to Options:** The final expression `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)` must be carefully compared to the given choices.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ).

Identify the System's States**\nThe system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each can be either +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy for Each State**\nThe energy is given by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We must calculate this for all 8 states. A systematic way is to list them out.\n\n| State (S1, S2, S3) | S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 | Energy (E) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| (+1, +1, +1) | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | -3J |\n| (+1, +1, -1) | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (+1, -1, +1) | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (-1, +1, +1) | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (+1, -1, -1) | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (-1, +1, -1) | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (-1, -1, +1) | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (-1, -1, -1) | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | -3J |\n\n**4. Group States by Energy Level (Find Degeneracy)**\nFrom the table, we can see there are only two distinct energy values. The number of states corresponding to each energy value is its degeneracy (g).\n\n*   **Energy Level 1 (E₁):** E₁ = -3J\n    *   This energy corresponds to the states where all spins are aligned: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The degeneracy is **g₁ = 2**.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2 (E₂):** E₂ = +J\n    *   This energy corresponds to all the other states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two.\n    *   There are **g₂ = 6** such states.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The sum of the degeneracies must equal the total number of states: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8.

This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates.\n\n2.  **Define the Energy Function**: The energy for any given state is `E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Energy for All States**: We must calculate the energy for each of the 8 states. A systematic way is to group them by the number of \"up\" (+1) and \"down\" (-1) spins.\n\n    *   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n        *   State (+1, +1, +1): `S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = 1+1+1 = 3`. So, `E = -J(3) = -3J`.\n        *   State (-1, -1, -1): `S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = 1+1+1 = 3`. So, `E = -J(3) = -3J`.\n        *   **Careful Point 1**: The energy is the same whether all spins are up or all are down. This gives an energy level of **E₁ = -3J** with a degeneracy (number of states) of **g₁ = 2**.\n\n    *   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n        *   Let's test state (+1, +1, -1): `S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = 1-1-1 = -1`. So, `E = -J(-1) = +J`.\n        *   Let's test state (+1, -1, -1): `S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = -1-1+1 = -1`. So, `E = -J(-1) = +J`.\n        *   **Careful Point 2**: Any state with one spin different from the other two will have the same energy. There are 3 ways to have one spin down and two up `(+,+,-), (+,-,+), (-,+,+)`, and 3 ways to have one spin up and two down `(+,-,-), (-,+,-), (-,-,+)`.\n        *   This gives a second energy level of **E₂ = +J** with a degeneracy of **g₂ = 3 + 3 = 6**.\n\n4.  **Construct the Partition Function**: The partition function `Z` is the sum over all energy levels of the degeneracy multiplied by the Boltzmann factor.\n    `Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)`\n\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    `Z = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))`\n\n    **Careful Point 3**: Pay close attention to the signs in the exponent. The negative sign in the Boltzmann factor `e^(-βE)` cancels with the negative sign in the energy `E₁ = -3J`.\n    `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**:\n    *   A) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta) - Incorrect energies.\n    *   B) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta) - Incorrect signs in exponents.\n    *   C) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta) - Incorrect energies and degeneracies swapped.\n    *   D) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta) - **This matches our result.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly derive the expression `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`.

The majority of the candidate answers correctly calculate the physics but many fail in the final step of matching their result to the given options.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Define the System and its States**\nThe system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each can be either +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2x2x2 = 8 possible configurations (microstates).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Energy for Each State**\nThe energy of a given state is determined by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. We must calculate this for all 8 states. A systematic way is to group the states by their nature.\n\n*   **Case A: All spins are aligned.**\n    1.  State (+1, +1, +1): E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = **-3J**\n    2.

State (+1, +1, -1): E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    4.  State (+1, -1, +1): E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    5.  State (-1, +1, +1): E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    6.  State (+1, -1, -1): E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    7.

State (-1, -1, +1): E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n\n    *   **Careful Point:** All six of these \"mixed spin\" states, regardless of whether it's one up/two down or two up/one down, result in the same energy value.\n    *   We find a second energy level E₂ = +J with a degeneracy of g₂ = 6.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the Partition Function (Z)**\nThe partition function is the sum over all energy levels of the degeneracy of that level multiplied by its Boltzmann factor: Z = Σᵢ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ).\n\n*   Contribution from E₁ = -3J:   g₁ * e^(-βE₁) = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ)\n*   Contribution from E₂ = +J:    g₂ * e^(-βE₂) = 6 * e^(-β * (J)) = 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The negative sign in the Boltzmann factor `e^(-βE)` is crucial. When the energy E is negative (like -3J), the exponent becomes positive.\n\nAdding the contributions gives the total partition function:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the Given Options**\nWe compare our final expression with the choices:\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nB) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated result, Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ), perfectly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its States**\n*   The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can take one of two values: +1 or -1.\n*   The total number of possible configurations (microstates) for the system is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Understand the Energy and Partition Function**\n*   The energy of a given state is defined by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n*   The partition function, Z, is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states.\n*   Z = Σ_states e^(-βE).\n*   A more efficient way to calculate Z is to group states by their energy level and use the formula Z = Σ_levels g_i * e^(-βE_i), where g_i is the degeneracy (the number of states) of the energy level E_i.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy for All Possible States**\nWe need to systematically list all 8 states and calculate their energies.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned (all up or all down).**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1):\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1):\n        E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   **Careful Point:** The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n    *   These two states have an energy of E₁ = -3J. The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    This covers all remaining 6 states. Let's calculate the energy for a representative state, e.g., (+1, +1, -1).\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J\n    *   By symmetry, all 6 states where the spins are not all aligned will have this same energy. These states are:\n        (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1)  (two up, one down)\n        (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1)  (one up, two down)\n    *   These six states have an energy of E₂ = +J. The degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\n**4. Construct the Partition Function**\nNow, we use the energy levels and their degeneracies to build the partition function Z.\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n\nSubstitute the values we found:\n*   g₁ = 2, E₁ = -3J\n*   g₂ = 6, E₂ = +J\n\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Pay close attention to the signs in the exponent. The formula is e^(-βE).\n    *   For E₁ = -3J, the term is e^(-β * -3J) = e^(3Jβ).\n    *   For E₂ = +J, the term is e^(-β * +J) = e^(-Jβ).\n\nSo, the final expression for the partition function is:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**5.

Many of the provided candidate answers correctly calculate the expression but then incorrectly match it to the wrong option letter. The derivation itself is consistent across most of the detailed analyses.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct answer, a step-by-step analysis of the problem is required. The process involves calculating the energy for every possible state of the system and then using these energies to construct the partition function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the States:** The system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each can be +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates.\n\n2.  **Energy Calculation:** The energy for each state is calculated using the Hamiltonian: E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We must evaluate this for all 8 states.\n\n    *   **State 1: All spins up (+1, +1, +1)**\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(3) = -3J\n\n    *   **State 2: All spins down (-1, -1, -1)**\n        E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n\n    *   **State 3: One spin flipped (e.g., +1, +1, -1)**\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = +J\n\n3.  **Determine Energy Levels and Degeneracy:** Instead of calculating the energy for all 8 states individually, we can group them by configuration type.\n\n    *   **Energy Level 1: All spins aligned.**\n        This includes the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n        Both states have an energy of **E₁ = -3J**.\n        The number of states with this energy (degeneracy) is **g₁ = 2**.\n\n    *   **Energy Level 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n        This includes states with two up/one down, such as (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), and (-1, +1, +1). It also includes states with one up/two down, such as (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n        All of these 6 states have an energy of **E₂ = +J**.\n        The number of states with this energy (degeneracy) is **g₂ = 6**.\n\n4.  **Construct the Partition Function:** The partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for each energy level, multiplied by their degeneracy.\n    Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    Z = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))\n    Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n### Careful Points and Common Errors\n\n*   **Sign of Energy:** The Hamiltonian has a negative sign, E = **-J**[...]. This is a critical detail.\n*   **Sign in Exponent:** The partition function formula has a negative sign in the exponent, Z = Σ e^(**-βE**). When the energy E is negative (like -3J), the two negatives cancel, resulting in a positive exponent (e^(3Jβ)). This is a frequent point of error.\n*   **Degeneracy Count:** It is essential to correctly count all states. The sum of degeneracies must equal the total number of states (2 + 6 = 8).\n*   **Matching to Options:** After deriving the correct formula, `2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`, it must be carefully matched to the given choices. Several of the candidate answers derived the correct formula but then selected the wrong letter.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently yields Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ). Comparing this to the options:\n\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python code successfully calculated the partition function for the three-spin system by systematically enumerating all 8 possible microstates.\n\nThe code's analysis identified two distinct energy levels and their corresponding degeneracies:\n1.  An energy level of **E = -3J** with a degeneracy of **2**. This occurs when all three spins are aligned (either all +1 or all -1).\n2.  An energy level of **E = +J** with a degeneracy of **6**. This occurs for the six states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two.\n\nThe partition function, Z, is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for each energy level, weighted by their degeneracy:\nZ = (degeneracy of E₁) * e^(-βE₁) + (degeneracy of E₂) * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis calculated expression, `2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nTo determine the correct partition function, a step-by-step analysis is required. The process involves enumerating all possible states of the system, calculating the energy for each state, grouping states by energy level to find their degeneracy, and finally summing the Boltzmann factors for each energy level.\n\n**Step 1: Define the System and its States**\nThe system has three spins: S₁, S₂, and S₃. Each spin can be in one of two states: +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates for the entire system.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Energy and Partition Function**\nThe energy of a given state is defined by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ ]\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all 8 states of the Boltzmann factor e<sup>-βE</sup>:\nZ = Σ<sub>states</sub> e<sup>-βE</sup>\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Energy for All Possible States**\nWe can systematically list all 8 states and calculate their corresponding energies. A table is useful for this.\n\n| State (S₁, S₂, S₃) | S₁S₂ | S₁S₃ | S₂S₃ | Sum (S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃) | Energy E = -J × (Sum) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| (+1, +1, +1) | +1 | +1 | +1 | +3 | **-3J** |\n| (-1, -1, -1) | +1 | +1 | +1 | +3 | **-3J** |\n| (+1, +1, -1) | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | **+J** |\n| (+1, -1, +1) | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 | **+J** |\n| (-1, +1, +1) | -1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | **+J** |\n| (+1, -1, -1) | -1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | **+J** |\n| (-1, +1, -1) | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 | **+J** |\n| (-1, -1, +1) | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | **+J** |\n\n**Careful Point 1: Energy Calculation.** It is crucial to correctly calculate the sum of the products for each state. For states where all spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1), the product of any two spins is +1, so the sum is 1+1+1=3. For states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two, there will be one (+1) product and two (-1) products, so the sum is -1. The energy is `-J` times this sum, which inverts the sign.\n\n**Step 4: Group States by Energy Level (Degeneracy)**\nFrom the table, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels:\n*   **Energy Level E₁ = -3J**: This level corresponds to the two states where all spins are aligned: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1). The degeneracy (number of states) is **g₁ = 2**.\n*   **Energy Level E₂ = +J**: This level corresponds to the six states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two. The degeneracy is **g₂ = 6**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Accounting for All States.** The sum of the degeneracies must equal the total number of states: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8. This confirms that all states have been accounted for.\n\n**Step 5: Construct the Partition Function**\nThe partition function is the sum of the contributions from each energy level, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g₁e<sup>-βE₁</sup> + g₂e<sup>-βE₂</sup>\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 × e<sup>-β(-3J)</sup> + 6 × e<sup>-β(+J)</sup>\n\n**Careful Point 3: Signs in the Exponent.** The formula for the Boltzmann factor has a negative sign, e<sup>-βE</sup>. When the energy E is itself negative (E₁ = -3J), the two negative signs cancel, resulting in a positive exponent.\nZ = 2e<sup>3Jβ</sup> + 6e<sup>-Jβ</sup>\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Options**\nThe calculated expression is Z = 2e<sup>3Jβ</sup> + 6e<sup>-Jβ</sup>. Let's compare this to the given choices:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nThe calculated result matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Objective**: To find the partition function Z for a system of three spins with energy E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e<sup>-βE</sup>, over all possible microstates of the system.\nZ = Σ<sub>states</sub> e<sup>-βE</sup>\n\n### Step 1: Identify All Possible States and Their Energies\n\nThe system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each can be +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates. We must calculate the energy for each one.\n\nA systematic way to do this is to group the states by the number of \"up\" (+1) and \"down\" (-1) spins.\n\n**Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n*   State 1: (+1, +1, +1) -> E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n*   State 2: (-1, -1, -1) -> E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n\n**Careful Point:** The energy depends on the product of the spins. Since (-1) * (-1) = +1, the all-down state has the same energy as the all-up state.\n\n**Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\nThis covers all remaining states. Let's calculate the energy for one example from this group.\n*   State 3: (+1, +1, -1) -> E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n\n**Careful Point:** By symmetry, any state with two spins in one direction and the third in the opposite direction will have the same energy. We can verify this for a state with two down spins and one up spin:\n*   State 4: (+1, -1, -1) -> E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n\nAll 6 states in this category have the same energy, +J. These states are:\n(+,+,-), (+,-,+), (-,+,+), (+,-,-), (-,+,-), (-,-,+)\n\n### Step 2: Group States by Energy Level (Find Degeneracy)\n\nFrom the calculations above, we have two distinct energy levels:\n\n1.  **Energy Level E₁ = -3J**: This level has 2 states. Its degeneracy is **g₁ = 2**.\n2.  **Energy Level E₂ = +J**: This level has 6 states. Its degeneracy is **g₂ = 6**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The sum of the degeneracies must equal the total number of states. Here, g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8, which confirms we have accounted for all possible microstates.\n\n### Step 3: Construct the Partition Function\n\nThe partition function can be written as a sum over the unique energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g₁ * e<sup>-βE₁</sup> + g₂ * e<sup>-βE₂</sup>\n\nNow, we substitute the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e<sup>-β(-3J)</sup> + 6 * e<sup>-β(+J)</sup>\n\n**Careful Point:** Pay close attention to the signs in the exponents. The formula for the Boltzmann factor has a negative sign, e<sup>-βE</sup>. When the energy E is itself negative (like E₁ = -3J), the two negatives cancel.\nZ = 2e<sup>3Jβ</sup> + 6e<sup>-Jβ</sup>\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options\n\nThe calculated partition function is **Z = 2e<sup>3Jβ</sup> + 6e<sup>-Jβ</sup>**.\n\nLet's compare this to the options provided:\nA) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nB) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nOur result exactly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
