The logical starting point is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which connects the uncertainty in position to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The principle, in its most precise form for minimum uncertainty, is:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n2.  **Calculating Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):** To find the *minimum* uncertainty in momentum, we use the equality from the principle.\n    *   Given: Δx = 0.1 nm = 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   Δp_min = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n    *   Δp_min = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    *   Δp_min ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n3.  **Relating Momentum Uncertainty to Energy Uncertainty:** The next step is to connect the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). The relationship between a particle's energy and momentum is given by v = dE/dp, where v is the particle's velocity. This relationship is valid for both classical and relativistic particles. For small uncertainties, this can be approximated as:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n4.  **Calculating Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE):** Finally, we use the given velocity of the electron and the calculated uncertainty in momentum to find the minimum uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Given: v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   ΔE_min ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\n    *   ΔE_min ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\n    *   ΔE_min ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Formula:** It is important to use the precise form of the uncertainty principle (Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ/2) for the minimum uncertainty, rather than approximations like Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ, although in this case, it would not change the final order of magnitude.\n*   **Relativistic Velocity:** The electron's speed is 2/3 the speed of light, making it relativistic. The relationship ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp is valid in this regime, as correctly identified by most of the candidate answers.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** All calculations must use standard SI units. The position uncertainty Δx = 0.1 nm must be converted to 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The candidate answers are inconsistent in how they label the final options (A, B, C, D). The calculated value of ~1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J must be compared directly against the options provided in the original question.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently and reliably yields a minimum energy uncertainty of approximately **1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J**.

The question asks for the *minimum* uncertainty, so using the equality `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)` is the correct approach. Using approximations like `Δp ≈ ħ / Δx` would yield a result twice as large, but the order of magnitude would remain the same, still pointing to the correct option.\n2.  **Relativistic Considerations:** The electron's speed (2 x 10⁸ m/s) is two-thirds the speed of light, making it relativistic. However, the relationship `ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp` is derived from `v = dE/dp`, which is the particle's group velocity. This is valid for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases, so the calculation holds.\n3.  **Unit Consistency:** It is crucial to convert the uncertainty in position from nanometers (nm) to SI units (meters) before performing the calculation (0.1 nm = 10⁻¹⁰ m).\n4.  **Option Mapping:** The candidate answers show significant confusion in mapping their correct numerical result to the lettered options (A, B, C, D) because the options were listed in different orders.

The logical starting point is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which connects the uncertainty in position to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The principle, in its most precise form for minimum uncertainty, is:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n2.  **Calculating Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):** To find the *minimum* uncertainty in momentum, we use the equality from the principle.\n    *   Given: Δx = 0.1 nm = 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   Δp_min = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n    *   Δp_min = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    *   Δp_min ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n3.  **Relating Momentum Uncertainty to Energy Uncertainty:** The next step is to connect the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). The relationship between a particle's energy and momentum is given by v = dE/dp, where v is the particle's velocity. This relationship is valid for both classical and relativistic particles. For small uncertainties, this can be approximated as:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n4.  **Calculating Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE):** Finally, we use the given velocity of the electron and the calculated uncertainty in momentum to find the minimum uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Given: v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   ΔE_min ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\n    *   ΔE_min ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\n    *   ΔE_min ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Formula:** It is important to use the precise form of the uncertainty principle (Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ/2) for the minimum uncertainty, rather than approximations like Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ, although in this case, it would not change the final order of magnitude.\n*   **Relativistic Velocity:** The electron's speed is 2/3 the speed of light, making it relativistic. The relationship ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp is valid in this regime, as correctly identified by most of the candidate answers.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** All calculations must use standard SI units. The position uncertainty Δx = 0.1 nm must be converted to 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The candidate answers are inconsistent in how they label the final options (A, B, C, D). The calculated value of ~1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J must be compared directly against the options provided in the original question.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently and reliably yields a minimum energy uncertainty of approximately **1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J**.

The solution involves two main physical principles.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp)**\n\nThis step uses the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in a particle's position to the uncertainty in its momentum.\n\n*   **Principle:** The position-momentum uncertainty principle is stated as:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n*   **Calculation:** To find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality:\n    Δp_min = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n*   **Given Values:**\n    *   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\n*   **Result:**\n    Δp_min = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    Δp_min = 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE)**\n\nThis step relates the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).\n\n*   **Principle:** The relationship between a small change in energy (dE) and a small change in momentum (dp) is given by the particle's group velocity, `v = dE/dp`. This relationship is valid for both classical and relativistic particles. For small uncertainties, we can approximate this as:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n*   **Calculation:** We use the result from Step 1 and the given velocity of the electron.\n\n*   **Given Values:**\n    *   v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   Δp_min ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n*   **Result:**\n    ΔE_min ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\n    ΔE_min ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\n    ΔE_min ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**Step 3: Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately **1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J**. We now compare this value to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n*   B) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n*   C) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n*   D) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n\nThe calculated value `1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J` is on the order of magnitude of 10⁻¹⁶ J, which corresponds to option C.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correct Formula for Minimum Uncertainty:** The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives a lower bound (≥). The question asks for the *minimum* uncertainty, so using the equality `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)` is the correct approach. Using approximations like `Δp ≈ ħ / Δx` would yield a result twice as large, but the order of magnitude would remain the same, still pointing to the correct option.\n2.  **Relativistic Considerations:** The electron's speed (2 x 10⁸ m/s) is two-thirds the speed of light, making it relativistic. However, the relationship `ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp` is derived from `v = dE/dp`, which is the particle's group velocity. This is valid for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases, so the calculation holds.\n3.  **Unit Consistency:** It is crucial to convert the uncertainty in position from nanometers (nm) to SI units (meters) before performing the calculation (0.1 nm = 10⁻¹⁰ m).\n4.  **Option Mapping:** The candidate answers show significant confusion in mapping their correct numerical result to the lettered options (A, B, C, D) because the options were listed in different orders.
