For example, several agents calculated 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M but chose options A, B, or C. This appears to be a simple clerical error or a result of working from a differently ordered list of options.\n*   **Conclusion**: The calculation is robust and consistently yields ~6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This corresponds directly to option D in the provided list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Calculation\nThe core of the problem is a chemical calculation. To ensure accuracy, I will first verify the calculation independently.\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ (source of H₂PO₄⁻) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (source of HPO₄²⁻) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Concentrations:**\n    *   Volume = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Calculate Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    The solution is a buffer of H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (conjugate base). The [H⁺] is governed by the Ka₂ equilibrium.\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    The [PO₄³⁻] is governed by the Ka₃ equilibrium, using the [H⁺] established by the buffer.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M) ≈ **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**\n\nThe calculation is robust and consistently yields a result of approximately 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Candidate Answers\n*   **Calculation Consensus:** Nearly all candidate answers that show their work (Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17) correctly perform the calculation and arrive at the numerical value of ~6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This indicates a very high degree of confidence in the calculation itself.\n\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Choice:** The final letter choices vary wildly (A, B, C, D are all chosen by different agents). This is the primary point of conflict.\n    *   **Reason for Discrepancy:** The agents appear to have been presented with different orderings of the multiple-choice options. For example, Answer 4 states that 6.24x10⁻⁷ M is option A, while Answer 7 states it is option B.\n    *   **Correct Mapping:** I must refer to the options as presented in the original question:\n        *   A) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n        *   B) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n        *   **C) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M**\n        *   D) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n\n### Step 3: Final Decision\nThe correct numerical result is **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**.

The calculation involves three main stages.\n\n**1. Calculate Initial Concentrations of Buffer Components**\nFirst, we determine the molar concentrations of the weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻) that form the buffer.\n*   **Volume:** 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n*   **Moles of H₂PO₄⁻** (from KH₂PO₄):\n    *   (1.00 g) / (136.09 g/mol) = 0.007348 mol\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **Moles of HPO₄²⁻** (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O):\n    *   (1.00 g) / (177.99 g/mol) = 0.005618 mol\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**2. Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**\nThe solution is a buffer, and its hydrogen ion concentration is determined by the equilibrium between the weak acid and its conjugate base. This corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n*   **Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   **Equilibrium Expression:** Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   Solving for [H⁺]:\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**3. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed in the third dissociation step, governed by Ka₃. We can use the [H⁺] calculated from the buffer equilibrium to find the [PO₄³⁻].\n*   **Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   **Equilibrium Expression:** Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   Solving for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**.\n\n### Careful Points and Common Errors\n\n1.  **Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is essential to use the molar mass for the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●**2H₂O** (177.99 g/mol), not the anhydrous form. All analyzed answers did this correctly.\n2.  **Identifying the Correct Equilibria:** The [H⁺] is set by the Ka₂ equilibrium, while the target ion [PO₄³⁻] is found using the Ka₃ equilibrium. This two-step process is crucial and was correctly identified by most candidates.\n3.  **Calculation Accuracy:** The arithmetic is straightforward but involves scientific notation, which can be a source of error. The majority of candidates performed the calculation correctly.\n4.  **Matching Result to Option:** The most significant source of error among the candidate answers was incorrectly matching the calculated value (6.24x10⁻⁷ M) to the corresponding lettered option.

The final, much smaller concentration of [PO₄³⁻] is then found using this [H⁺] and the Ka₃ equilibrium.\n*   **Approximations:** The initial concentrations of the buffer components are used in the calculation.

Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**\n\nThe solution is a buffer dominated by the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ conjugate pair. This corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, so we use Ka₂ to find the [H⁺].\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   **Equilibrium Constant:** Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n*   The expression for Ka₂ is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n**3. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed in the third dissociation step, which is governed by Ka₃.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   **Equilibrium Constant:** Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n*   The expression for Ka₃ is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   Substituting the known values:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**4.

All agents correctly identified this.\n*   **Relevant Equilibria:** The [H⁺] is set by the main buffer components (H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻) and the Ka₂ equilibrium. The final target ion, [PO₄³⁻], is found using the [H⁺] from the first step and the Ka₃ equilibrium. This two-step equilibrium calculation is the correct approach.\n*   **Approximations:** It is valid to use the initial concentrations of the buffer components in the calculations because they are in a buffer and the Ka values are small, meaning the change in their concentrations at equilibrium is negligible.\n*   **Option Matching:** The primary discrepancy among the candidate answers was not the calculation itself but the final selection of the lettered option.

This corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   **Equilibrium Expression:** Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion [PO₄³⁻] Concentration**\nThe orthophosphate ion is formed in the third dissociation step, governed by Ka₃.

A failure to do so would lead to an incorrect concentration for the conjugate base.\n2.  **Identifying the Correct Equilibria:** The problem involves a polyprotic acid system. One must recognize that the [H⁺] is established by the main buffer components (H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻) via the Ka₂ equilibrium. The target ion (PO₄³⁻) is a minor species whose concentration is then determined using this [H⁺] and the Ka₃ equilibrium.\n3.  **Sequential Calculation:** The problem must be solved in a specific order.

The calculation involves three main stages.\n\n**1. Calculate Initial Concentrations of Buffer Components**\nFirst, we determine the molar concentrations of the weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻) that form the buffer.\n*   **Volume:** 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n*   **Moles of H₂PO₄⁻** (from KH₂PO₄):\n    *   (1.00 g) / (136.09 g/mol) = 0.007348 mol\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **Moles of HPO₄²⁻** (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O):\n    *   (1.00 g) / (177.99 g/mol) = 0.005618 mol\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**2. Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**\nThe solution is a buffer, and its hydrogen ion concentration is determined by the equilibrium between the weak acid and its conjugate base. This corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n*   **Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   **Equilibrium Expression:** Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   Solving for [H⁺]:\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**3.

We can use the [H⁺] calculated from the buffer equilibrium to find the [PO₄³⁻].\n*   **Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   **Equilibrium Expression:** Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   Solving for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**.\n\n### Careful Points and Common Errors\n\n1.  **Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is essential to use the molar mass for the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●**2H₂O** (177.99 g/mol), not the anhydrous form. All analyzed answers did this correctly.\n2.  **Identifying the Correct Equilibria:** The [H⁺] is set by the Ka₂ equilibrium, while the target ion [PO₄³⁻] is found using the Ka₃ equilibrium. This two-step process is crucial and was correctly identified by most candidates.\n3.  **Calculation Accuracy:** The arithmetic is straightforward but involves scientific notation, which can be a source of error. The majority of candidates performed the calculation correctly.\n4.  **Matching Result to Option:** The most significant source of error among the candidate answers was incorrectly matching the calculated value (6.24x10⁻⁷ M) to the corresponding lettered option.

Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed in the third dissociation step, which is governed by Ka₃.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   **Equilibrium Constant:** Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n*   The expression for Ka₃ is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   Substituting the known values:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M. Rounding to three significant figures, this is **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   **A) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M**\n*   B) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n*   C) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n*   D) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option A exactly.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Molar Mass:** It is crucial to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), not the anhydrous form. All agents correctly identified this.\n*   **Relevant Equilibria:** The [H⁺] is set by the main buffer components (H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻) and the Ka₂ equilibrium. The final target ion, [PO₄³⁻], is found using the [H⁺] from the first step and the Ka₃ equilibrium. This two-step equilibrium calculation is the correct approach.\n*   **Approximations:** It is valid to use the initial concentrations of the buffer components in the calculations because they are in a buffer and the Ka values are small, meaning the change in their concentrations at equilibrium is negligible.\n*   **Option Matching:** The primary discrepancy among the candidate answers was not the calculation itself but the final selection of the lettered option. The calculation robustly yields ~6.24x10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n### Analysis of the Problem and Candidate Answers\n\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) in a phosphate buffer solution. An analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a consistent methodological approach, despite discrepancies in their final letter choices.\n\n**Careful Points and Step-by-Step Derivation:**\n\n1.  **Identify Components and Their Roles**: The solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O.\n    *   KH₂PO₄ provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻), which acts as the weak acid in the buffer system.\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻), which is the conjugate base.\n    *   It is crucial to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), not the anhydrous form.\n\n2.  **Calculate Molar Concentrations**: The first step is to determine the molarity of the acid and base components.\n    *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L.\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the Governing Equilibria**: Phosphoric acid is a triprotic acid with three dissociation constants (Ka).\n    *   H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ (Ka₁)\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (Ka₂)\n    *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (Ka₃)\n    *   Since the primary components are H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, the pH of the buffer is established by the second equilibrium, governed by Ka₂.\n    *   The target ion, orthophosphate (PO₄³⁻), is produced in the third equilibrium, governed by Ka₃.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**: The [H⁺] is determined by the buffer equilibrium. The Ka values provided in the problem (Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸) are consistent with standard literature values.\n    *   From the Ka₂ expression: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M.\n    *   The approximation of using initial concentrations is valid here because it is a buffer solution and the concentrations are significantly larger than the Ka value.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**: Now, use the [H⁺] found in the previous step and the third equilibrium expression. The Ka₃ value is given as 1.8x10⁻¹².\n    *   From the Ka₃ expression: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]: [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n6.  **Final Answer Selection**: The calculated concentration is approximately 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this to the original options provided:\n    *   A) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   B) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   C) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   D) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C. The inconsistencies in the candidate answers' final letter choices stem from a misattribution of the letters to the numerical options, not from errors in the chemical calculation itself. The overwhelming majority of the candidates correctly calculated the numerical answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
