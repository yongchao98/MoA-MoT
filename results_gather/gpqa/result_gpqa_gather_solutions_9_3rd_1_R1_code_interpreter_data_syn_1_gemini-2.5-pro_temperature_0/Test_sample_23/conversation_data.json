  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nIf an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\n\nA) 18\nB) 16\nC) 12\nD) 22\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided answers and highlighting the key points.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a \"widely used as a solvent\".\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the given information.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   **Information**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ ring (since it hydrogenates to cyclohexane) and must not decolorize bromine water (meaning it is saturated or aromatic). The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer. This strongly suggests that if one product is the fully hydrogenated compound (cyclohexane), the other is the fully dehydrogenated compound (benzene).\n*   **Conclusion**: The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. It is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Reaction**: We can write the reaction for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Core Principle**: The most direct way to solve the problem is to apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms. The total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation**: We sum the hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion**: By the law of conservation, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n**Careful Points and Verification:**\n1.  **The \"Only One Substance\" Clue**: The fact that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y yields only Z (cyclohexane) is a critical piece of information. It confirms that all compounds involved have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n2.  **Conservation of Atoms**: This is the most efficient and robust method to solve the problem. It does not require identifying the specific components of mixture X.\n3.  **\"No Conjugated Bonds\" Clue**: This information is used to verify the chemical plausibility of the scenario. The components of X must be unsaturated C₆ rings whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The only non-conjugated pair that works is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The sum of their hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18, which confirms our answer.\n4.  **Mapping to Options**: The calculated numerical answer is 18. It is crucial to match this number to the correct letter in the provided options.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first crucial step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is also saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12.01x + 1.008y)`. Using approximate masses (C=12, H=1), we get `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`. This simplifies to `7y = 12x + y`, which gives `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point**: A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane. Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion**: Given that Z is a common solvent, the most logical and well-known cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ for n=6.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information**: Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). Y does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: Since one component is cyclohexane, the other must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as the entire mixture hydrogenates to only cyclohexane. This second component does not decolorize bromine water, which means it is not a typical alkene; it must be saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point**: The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation, a type of reaction that often produces a fully saturated compound (cyclohexane) and a fully unsaturated, stable aromatic compound (benzene) from an intermediate.\n*   **Conclusion**: The second component must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Find the Answer\nThe final step is to use the information about the reaction to find the answer.\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Reaction**: `Component X₁ + Component X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point**: The most fundamental principle to apply here is the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation.\n*   **Calculation**: We can sum the hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n*   **Conclusion**: By the law of conservation, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must also be **18**.\n\n### Verification (Optional)\nTo ensure the scenario is chemically plausible, we can identify the components of X. They must be C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water) but lack conjugated bonds. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all criteria. Their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18, which confirms the result obtained from the reaction balance.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Our analysis shows this number is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by systematically deducing the identities of the substances involved, starting with the most well-defined one, and then applying the law of conservation of atoms to the central chemical reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** I will first determine the molecular formula of substance Z using its given mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%). Combining this with the information that it's a saturated, common solvent allows for its precise identification.\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** Knowing that Z is a component of mixture Y, and that Y is formed from a disproportionation reaction, I can deduce the other component of Y. The properties of Y (does not decolorize bromine water, hydrogenates to only Z) are key clues.\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Atoms:** The core of the solution lies in the disproportionation reaction: `Mixture X -> Mixture Y`. By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (the two liquids of mixture Y).\n4.  **Calculate and Conclude:** I will calculate the total hydrogen atoms in the identified components of mixture Y. This sum will be the answer to the question. The Python code will formalize this calculation and present the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry problem by deducing the number of hydrogen atoms\n    based on the law of conservation of atoms applied to the described chemical reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify Substance Z.\n    # The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, which is ~1/7.\n    # For a hydrocarbon C_xH_y, the mass fraction of H is y / (12x + y).\n    # y / (12x + y) = 1/7  => 7y = 12x + y => 6y = 12x => y = 2x.\n    # The formula is C_nH_2n.

Identify Substance Z**\n*   **Careful Point**: The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%, which is a key piece of information. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   **Analysis**: For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving (`7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x`) gives the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point**: The problem states Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion**: Given that Z is a widely used solvent and the central product of all hydrogenations, it is identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. All candidate answers correctly deduce this.\n\n**2. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   **Careful Point**: Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. It is an equimolar mixture containing Z.\n*   **Analysis**: One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton (since hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane) and must not react with bromine water. The only compound fitting this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This is a unanimous conclusion among all candidate answers.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Final Answer**\n*   **Careful Point**: The core of the problem is the disproportionation reaction where mixture X forms mixture Y. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The law of conservation of atoms is the key principle to apply.\n*   **Analysis**: The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component, as the mixtures are equimolar:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion**: Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n**4. Verification (Optional but Confirmatory)**\n*   **Careful Point**: The components of X must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated bonds.\n*   **Analysis**: The pair that fits this description and has a total of 18 hydrogen atoms is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This confirms the entire chemical scheme is plausible.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane. The problem states that all compounds involved have the same carbon skeleton and that Z is a common solvent. This strongly indicates that Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** Since one component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the other component must also have a C₆ skeleton and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Because it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene. The only compound that fits these criteria is an aromatic one.\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer**\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Core Principle:** The law of conservation of atoms dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.

It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving for the ratio of y to x gives `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point 1**: A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated.\n*   **Conclusion**: The clues that Z is a common solvent and the central product of all reactions strongly point to it being **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ (with n=6) and all other descriptions.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Carbon Skeleton and Identify Mixture Y\n*   **Information**: Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane). Mixture Y is equimolar, contains Z, and does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   **Careful Point 2**: The fact that all hydrogenations lead exclusively to cyclohexane is critical. It implies that all four compounds involved (the two in X and the two in Y) share the same six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   **Analysis of Mixture Y**: One component of Y is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also be a C₆ cyclic compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene.\n*   **Careful Point 3**: An unsaturated compound that is unreactive towards bromine water under normal conditions is characteristic of an aromatic compound. The C₆ aromatic compound is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\n*   **Information**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y in a disproportionation reaction upon heating with platinum.\n*   **The Reaction**: Since both mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A from X) + (Component B from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 4**: The most direct path to the solution is the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the reactant and product sides of the equation. It is not necessary to identify the specific components of mixture X to find the answer.\n*   **Calculation**: We can sum the hydrogen atoms in the known products:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion**: By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### (Verification Step)\n*   **Careful Point 5**: The properties of mixture X (decolorizes bromine water, no conjugated bonds) serve to confirm the plausibility of the reaction. The two C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated, non-conjugated, and whose hydrogens sum to 18 are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a valid hydrogen transfer, confirming the entire scheme.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The calculation based on the conservation of atoms shows this to be 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate answers and identifying the key points.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving gives `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point**: A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula Cn H₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated.\n*   **Conclusion**: Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification is a cornerstone of the solution and is correctly made by all candidate answers.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information**: Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as it hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene.\n*   **Careful Point**: The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. This type of reaction often involves the transfer of hydrogen to create a fully saturated molecule and a fully unsaturated (aromatic) one from intermediate unsaturated species.\n*   **Conclusion**: The second component must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe final step uses the law of conservation of atoms to find the answer without needing to definitively identify the components of mixture X.\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X undergoes disproportionation to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   **Reaction**: `Component X₁ + Component X₂ → Component Y₁ + Component Y₂`\n*   **Analysis**: Substituting the identified components of Y, the reaction is:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point**: The law of conservation of atoms dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. This is the most direct path to the solution.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion**: The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by identifying the likely components of X as cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), which are non-conjugated unsaturated rings whose hydrogens sum to 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The calculated value is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is also saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane. The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, which fits the formula and all other descriptions.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The second component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as its hydrogenation produces cyclohexane. Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a standard alkene. This points towards it being an aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** The aromatic compound with a six-carbon skeleton is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to equimolar mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** A disproportionation reaction involves a single substance being simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules gain hydrogen and others lose it. The overall reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Applying Conservation of Atoms:** According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction. We can sum the hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion:** The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   The identification of Z as cyclohexane is the crucial first step that unlocks the rest of the problem.\n*   The fact that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y yields *only* Z is a key piece of information, confirming that all four compounds involved (two in X, two in Y) share the same C₆ cyclic carbon skeleton.\n*   The solution relies on the principle of atom conservation. It is not strictly necessary to identify the components of mixture X to find the answer, but doing so confirms the consistency of the entire chemical scheme. The components of X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), whose hydrogens sum to 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Our analysis shows this number is 18. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 18\nB) 12\nC) 22\nD) 16\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer. The reasoning is synthesized from the common logical steps found in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n*   **Careful Point**: The first crucial step is to correctly identify the central substance, Z.\n*   **Analysis**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The problem states that Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The clues that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" and is the sole product of all hydrogenations strongly point to the most common and stable C₆ cycloalkane, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Careful Point**: The properties of mixture Y allow for the deduction of its second component.\n*   **Analysis**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton (since hydrogenation of Y gives only Z) and must not react with bromine water. The only compound that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   Therefore, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms\n*   **Careful Point**: The core of the problem is understanding the stoichiometry and applying the conservation of atoms to the disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y in a disproportionation reaction. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side. We can balance the hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n*   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Plausibility of Mixture X (Optional Confirmation)\n*   **Careful Point**: The problem states that the components of X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Analysis**: The components of X must be C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated. The two most logical candidates whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18 are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. Importantly, 1,4-cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated double bonds, fitting the problem's constraint (unlike its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene). This confirms the entire chemical scheme is plausible.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms in the reaction, this value is 18. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 18\nB) 12\nC) 16\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logical steps and highlighting the careful points required for a robust solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z using the provided information.\n\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis**:\n    1.  The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    2.  For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12.01x + 1.008y)`. Using approximate masses (C=12, H=1), this is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    3.  Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    4.  The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point**: A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states Z is saturated, which rules out alkenes. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion**: Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ (with n=6) and all other descriptions.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n\n*   **Information**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is one of its components. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis**:\n    1.  One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    2.  The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton, as hydrogenation of the entire mixture yields only cyclohexane.\n    3.  This second component does not decolorize bromine water, which means it is either saturated or aromatic. Since it's different from cyclohexane, it must be aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point**: The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. In the context of cyclic hydrocarbons on a platinum catalyst, this typically involves hydrogen transfer to create the fully saturated (most reduced) compound and the fully unsaturated (most oxidized/dehydrogenated) aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion**: The aromatic C₆ compound is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem is solved by analyzing the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X undergoes disproportionation to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis**: The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point**: The most direct way to solve the problem is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. This fundamental principle states that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation. This allows us to find the answer without needing to identify the exact structures of the components in mixture X.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional but Confirmatory)\nWe can verify this result by identifying plausible structures for the components of mixture X.\n\n*   **Information**: The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated), have no conjugated multiple bonds, and both hydrogenate to form only cyclohexane (meaning they are C₆ cyclic compounds).\n*   **Analysis**: We need two different, non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The only pair that fits this description is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   **Careful Point**: The isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated.\n*   **Conclusion**: The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This confirms that our result from the conservation of atoms is consistent with a chemically plausible scenario.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The calculation based on the conservation of atoms definitively shows this number is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer. The solution synthesizes the correct logical steps identified in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is also saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction 14.28% is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7. Let the molecular formula of Z be CₓHᵧ. Using the approximate atomic masses of Carbon (12) and Hydrogen (1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   `y = 2x`\n*   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated, it cannot be an alkene and must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion:** The most common cycloalkane that is widely used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula (n=6) and all other descriptions.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** Since one component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as hydrogenation of the entire mixture yields only cyclohexane. This second component does not decolorize bromine water, which means it is either saturated or aromatic. Since it must be different from cyclohexane but still yield cyclohexane upon hydrogenation, it must be the corresponding aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** The aromatic compound with a six-carbon skeleton is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Find the Answer\nThe core of the problem lies in the conservation of atoms during the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** A disproportionation reaction, in this context, is a hydrogen transfer reaction. We can write the overall reaction for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point (Conservation of Atoms):** The law of conservation of atoms dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation. We can simply sum the hydrogen atoms in the products to find the total in the reactants.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion:** The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional but Confirmatory)\nWe can check if there are plausible molecules for mixture X that fit all the given constraints.\n*   **Constraints for X:** The components must be C₆ cyclic compounds (since they hydrogenate to cyclohexane), they must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), and they must not have conjugated multiple bonds. Their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n*   **Plausible Candidates:** The two compounds that fit this description are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆ rings.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated double bonds, satisfying the condition. (The isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and is therefore excluded).\n*   This confirms that the entire chemical scheme is plausible and the result from the conservation of atoms is correct.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis**:\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` leads to the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   Therefore, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point**: A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion**: Given that Z is a common solvent, the most logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification is unanimously and correctly made by all candidate answers.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Information**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It contains Z (cyclohexane), does not decolorize bromine water, and its complete hydrogenation gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis**:\n    *   One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   The other component must also have a C₆ carbon skeleton, as hydrogenation of the entire mixture yields only cyclohexane.\n    *   This second component does not decolorize bromine water, which means it is either saturated or aromatic. Since it must be different from cyclohexane, it cannot be another saturated C₆ isomer.\n    *   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation, which is a hydrogen transfer. This strongly suggests that if one product is the fully hydrogenated compound (cyclohexane), the other is the fully dehydrogenated compound (benzene).\n*   **Conclusion**: The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This conclusion is also consistent across all candidate answers.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis**: The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point**: The most direct way to solve the problem is to apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms.

The pair that fits this description and whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18 is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, which confirms the result derived from the reaction balance.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The analysis consistently and robustly shows this number to be 18.\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\nA) 22\nB) 12\nC) 16\nD) 18\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers and highlighting the critical points.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n\n*   **Information Given:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving gives `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point:** A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated and react with hydrogen.\n*   **Conclusion:** The problem states Z is a common solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula (n=6) and all other descriptions.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\n*   **Information Given:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It contains Z (cyclohexane) and does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene; it must be saturated or aromatic. As it is not cyclohexane itself, the only remaining possibility is that it is aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point:** The aromatic compound with a C₆ skeleton is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature with a catalyst), which is consistent with the problem statement.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer\n\n*   **Information Given:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A from X) + (Component B from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The most direct way to solve the problem is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation. This allows us to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X without needing to know the exact identity of its components.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional but Confirms Consistency)\n\n*   **Information Given:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds. They both hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   **Analysis:** We need two different, non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated.\n*   **Verification:** The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This pair of compounds fits all the given constraints and confirms that the result obtained from the conservation law is chemically sound.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The analysis consistently shows this number to be 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a \"widely used as a solvent\".\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion:** The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits the formula and all the given descriptions. Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** Since one component is cyclohexane, the other must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as the entire mixture hydrogenates to only cyclohexane. This second component does not decolorize bromine water, which means it is not a typical alkene; it is either saturated or aromatic. Since it must be different from cyclohexane but still hydrogenate to it, it must be the corresponding aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is benzene (C₆H₆). Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Find the Answer\nThe core of the problem is understanding the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** `Component X₁ + Component X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The law of conservation of atoms is the key to solving this problem without needing to identify the exact components of X.

This fits the formula (n=6) and all other descriptions. Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Information**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as it hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   **Careful Point**: Since the mixture does not decolorize bromine water, the second component must be saturated or aromatic. As it is different from cyclohexane, it cannot be another saturated C₆ isomer that would hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   **Conclusion**: The only logical second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.

The two most plausible candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The other isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus excluded.\n*   **Check**: The sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (10) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8) is 10 + 8 = 18.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers and highlighting the critical points.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a \"widely used as a solvent\".\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` leads to `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated.\n*   **Conclusion:** The fact that Z is a common solvent and the sole product of all hydrogenations (implying a common carbon skeleton for all compounds) strongly points to it being **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It contains Z (cyclohexane), does not decolorize bromine water, and its complete hydrogenation gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ carbon skeleton, as hydrogenation of the entire mixture yields only cyclohexane.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is either saturated or aromatic. As it is different from cyclohexane, it cannot be another saturated C₆ isomer. The reaction type, disproportionation, strongly suggests a hydrogen transfer to form the most reduced (cyclohexane) and most oxidized/dehydrogenated (benzene) stable products.\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The most direct and robust way to solve the problem is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. This allows us to find the answer without needing to definitively identify the components of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional but Confirmatory)\n*   **Information:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Careful Point 4:** We can check if there are plausible molecules for mixture X that fit all constraints. They must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18 and which lack conjugation. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits perfectly. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated, confirming the entire chemical scheme is plausible.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The analysis consistently shows this number to be 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"

It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a \"widely used as a solvent\".\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the given information.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   **Information**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ ring (since it hydrogenates to cyclohexane) and must not decolorize bromine water (meaning it is saturated or aromatic). The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer. This strongly suggests that if one product is the fully hydrogenated compound (cyclohexane), the other is the fully dehydrogenated compound (benzene).\n*   **Conclusion**: The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. It is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Reaction**: We can write the reaction for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Core Principle**: The most direct way to solve the problem is to apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms. The total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation**: We sum the hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion**: By the law of conservation, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n**Careful Points and Verification:**\n1.  **The \"Only One Substance\" Clue**: The fact that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y yields only Z (cyclohexane) is a critical piece of information. It confirms that all compounds involved have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n2.  **Conservation of Atoms**: This is the most efficient and robust method to solve the problem. It does not require identifying the specific components of mixture X.\n3.  **\"No Conjugated Bonds\" Clue**: This information is used to verify the chemical plausibility of the scenario. The components of X must be unsaturated C₆ rings whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The only non-conjugated pair that works is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The sum of their hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18, which confirms our answer.\n4.  **Mapping to Options**: The calculated numerical answer is 18. It is crucial to match this number to the correct letter in the provided options.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first crucial step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is also saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12.01x + 1.008y)`. Using approximate masses (C=12, H=1), we get `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`. This simplifies to `7y = 12x + y`, which gives `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point**: A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane. Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion**: Given that Z is a common solvent, the most logical and well-known cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ for n=6.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information**: Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). Y does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: Since one component is cyclohexane, the other must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as the entire mixture hydrogenates to only cyclohexane. This second component does not decolorize bromine water, which means it is not a typical alkene; it must be saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point**: The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation, a type of reaction that often produces a fully saturated compound (cyclohexane) and a fully unsaturated, stable aromatic compound (benzene) from an intermediate.\n*   **Conclusion**: The second component must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Find the Answer\nThe final step is to use the information about the reaction to find the answer.\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Reaction**: `Component X₁ + Component X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point**: The most fundamental principle to apply here is the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation.\n*   **Calculation**: We can sum the hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n*   **Conclusion**: By the law of conservation, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must also be **18**.\n\n### Verification (Optional)\nTo ensure the scenario is chemically plausible, we can identify the components of X. They must be C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water) but lack conjugated bonds. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all criteria. Their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18, which confirms the result obtained from the reaction balance.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Our analysis shows this number is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by systematically deducing the identities of the substances involved, starting with the most well-defined one, and then applying the law of conservation of atoms to the central chemical reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** I will first determine the molecular formula of substance Z using its given mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%). Combining this with the information that it's a saturated, common solvent allows for its precise identification.\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** Knowing that Z is a component of mixture Y, and that Y is formed from a disproportionation reaction, I can deduce the other component of Y. The properties of Y (does not decolorize bromine water, hydrogenates to only Z) are key clues.\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Atoms:** The core of the solution lies in the disproportionation reaction: `Mixture X -> Mixture Y`. By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (the two liquids of mixture Y).\n4.  **Calculate and Conclude:** I will calculate the total hydrogen atoms in the identified components of mixture Y. This sum will be the answer to the question. The Python code will formalize this calculation and present the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry problem by deducing the number of hydrogen atoms\n    based on the law of conservation of atoms applied to the described chemical reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify Substance Z.\n    # The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, which is ~1/7.\n    # For a hydrocarbon C_xH_y, the mass fraction of H is y / (12x + y).\n    # y / (12x + y) = 1/7  => 7y = 12x + y => 6y = 12x => y = 2x.\n    # The formula is C_nH_2n.

Identify Substance Z**\n*   **Careful Point**: The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%, which is a key piece of information. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   **Analysis**: For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving (`7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x`) gives the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point**: The problem states Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion**: Given that Z is a widely used solvent and the central product of all hydrogenations, it is identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. All candidate answers correctly deduce this.\n\n**2. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   **Careful Point**: Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. It is an equimolar mixture containing Z.\n*   **Analysis**: One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton (since hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane) and must not react with bromine water. The only compound fitting this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This is a unanimous conclusion among all candidate answers.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Final Answer**\n*   **Careful Point**: The core of the problem is the disproportionation reaction where mixture X forms mixture Y. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The law of conservation of atoms is the key principle to apply.\n*   **Analysis**: The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component, as the mixtures are equimolar:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion**: Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n**4.

It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.

The problem states that all compounds involved have the same carbon skeleton and that Z is a common solvent. This strongly indicates that Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** Since one component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the other component must also have a C₆ skeleton and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Because it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene. The only compound that fits these criteria is an aromatic one.\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer**\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Core Principle:** The law of conservation of atoms dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.

It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving for the ratio of y to x gives `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point 1**: A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated.\n*   **Conclusion**: The clues that Z is a common solvent and the central product of all reactions strongly point to it being **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ (with n=6) and all other descriptions.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Carbon Skeleton and Identify Mixture Y\n*   **Information**: Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane). Mixture Y is equimolar, contains Z, and does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   **Careful Point 2**: The fact that all hydrogenations lead exclusively to cyclohexane is critical. It implies that all four compounds involved (the two in X and the two in Y) share the same six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   **Analysis of Mixture Y**: One component of Y is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also be a C₆ cyclic compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene.\n*   **Careful Point 3**: An unsaturated compound that is unreactive towards bromine water under normal conditions is characteristic of an aromatic compound. The C₆ aromatic compound is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\n*   **Information**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y in a disproportionation reaction upon heating with platinum.\n*   **The Reaction**: Since both mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A from X) + (Component B from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 4**: The most direct path to the solution is the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the reactant and product sides of the equation. It is not necessary to identify the specific components of mixture X to find the answer.\n*   **Calculation**: We can sum the hydrogen atoms in the known products:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion**: By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### (Verification Step)\n*   **Careful Point 5**: The properties of mixture X (decolorizes bromine water, no conjugated bonds) serve to confirm the plausibility of the reaction. The two C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated, non-conjugated, and whose hydrogens sum to 18 are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a valid hydrogen transfer, confirming the entire scheme.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The calculation based on the conservation of atoms shows this to be 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate answers and identifying the key points.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving gives `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point**: A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula Cn H₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated.\n*   **Conclusion**: Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification is a cornerstone of the solution and is correctly made by all candidate answers.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information**: Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as it hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene.\n*   **Careful Point**: The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. This type of reaction often involves the transfer of hydrogen to create a fully saturated molecule and a fully unsaturated (aromatic) one from intermediate unsaturated species.\n*   **Conclusion**: The second component must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe final step uses the law of conservation of atoms to find the answer without needing to definitively identify the components of mixture X.\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X undergoes disproportionation to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   **Reaction**: `Component X₁ + Component X₂ → Component Y₁ + Component Y₂`\n*   **Analysis**: Substituting the identified components of Y, the reaction is:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point**: The law of conservation of atoms dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. This is the most direct path to the solution.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion**: The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by identifying the likely components of X as cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), which are non-conjugated unsaturated rings whose hydrogens sum to 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The calculated value is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is also saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane. The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, which fits the formula and all other descriptions.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The second component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as its hydrogenation produces cyclohexane. Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a standard alkene. This points towards it being an aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** The aromatic compound with a six-carbon skeleton is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to equimolar mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** A disproportionation reaction involves a single substance being simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules gain hydrogen and others lose it. The overall reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Applying Conservation of Atoms:** According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction. We can sum the hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion:** The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   The identification of Z as cyclohexane is the crucial first step that unlocks the rest of the problem.\n*   The fact that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y yields *only* Z is a key piece of information, confirming that all four compounds involved (two in X, two in Y) share the same C₆ cyclic carbon skeleton.\n*   The solution relies on the principle of atom conservation. It is not strictly necessary to identify the components of mixture X to find the answer, but doing so confirms the consistency of the entire chemical scheme. The components of X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), whose hydrogens sum to 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Our analysis shows this number is 18. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 18\nB) 12\nC) 22\nD) 16\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer. The reasoning is synthesized from the common logical steps found in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n*   **Careful Point**: The first crucial step is to correctly identify the central substance, Z.\n*   **Analysis**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The problem states that Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The clues that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" and is the sole product of all hydrogenations strongly point to the most common and stable C₆ cycloalkane, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Careful Point**: The properties of mixture Y allow for the deduction of its second component.\n*   **Analysis**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton (since hydrogenation of Y gives only Z) and must not react with bromine water. The only compound that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   Therefore, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms\n*   **Careful Point**: The core of the problem is understanding the stoichiometry and applying the conservation of atoms to the disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y in a disproportionation reaction. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side. We can balance the hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n*   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Plausibility of Mixture X (Optional Confirmation)\n*   **Careful Point**: The problem states that the components of X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Analysis**: The components of X must be C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated. The two most logical candidates whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18 are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. Importantly, 1,4-cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated double bonds, fitting the problem's constraint (unlike its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene). This confirms the entire chemical scheme is plausible.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms in the reaction, this value is 18. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 18\nB) 12\nC) 16\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logical steps and highlighting the careful points required for a robust solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z using the provided information.\n\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis**:\n    1.  The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    2.  For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12.01x + 1.008y)`. Using approximate masses (C=12, H=1), this is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    3.  Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    4.  The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point**: A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states Z is saturated, which rules out alkenes. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion**: Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ (with n=6) and all other descriptions.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n\n*   **Information**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is one of its components. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis**:\n    1.  One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    2.  The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton, as hydrogenation of the entire mixture yields only cyclohexane.\n    3.  This second component does not decolorize bromine water, which means it is either saturated or aromatic. Since it's different from cyclohexane, it must be aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point**: The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. In the context of cyclic hydrocarbons on a platinum catalyst, this typically involves hydrogen transfer to create the fully saturated (most reduced) compound and the fully unsaturated (most oxidized/dehydrogenated) aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion**: The aromatic C₆ compound is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem is solved by analyzing the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X undergoes disproportionation to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis**: The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point**: The most direct way to solve the problem is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. This fundamental principle states that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation. This allows us to find the answer without needing to identify the exact structures of the components in mixture X.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional but Confirmatory)\nWe can verify this result by identifying plausible structures for the components of mixture X.\n\n*   **Information**: The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated), have no conjugated multiple bonds, and both hydrogenate to form only cyclohexane (meaning they are C₆ cyclic compounds).\n*   **Analysis**: We need two different, non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The only pair that fits this description is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   **Careful Point**: The isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated.\n*   **Conclusion**: The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This confirms that our result from the conservation of atoms is consistent with a chemically plausible scenario.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The calculation based on the conservation of atoms definitively shows this number is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer. The solution synthesizes the correct logical steps identified in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is also saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction 14.28% is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7. Let the molecular formula of Z be CₓHᵧ. Using the approximate atomic masses of Carbon (12) and Hydrogen (1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   `y = 2x`\n*   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated, it cannot be an alkene and must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion:** The most common cycloalkane that is widely used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula (n=6) and all other descriptions.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** Since one component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as hydrogenation of the entire mixture yields only cyclohexane. This second component does not decolorize bromine water, which means it is either saturated or aromatic. Since it must be different from cyclohexane but still yield cyclohexane upon hydrogenation, it must be the corresponding aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** The aromatic compound with a six-carbon skeleton is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Find the Answer\nThe core of the problem lies in the conservation of atoms during the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** A disproportionation reaction, in this context, is a hydrogen transfer reaction. We can write the overall reaction for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point (Conservation of Atoms):** The law of conservation of atoms dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation. We can simply sum the hydrogen atoms in the products to find the total in the reactants.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion:** The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional but Confirmatory)\nWe can check if there are plausible molecules for mixture X that fit all the given constraints.\n*   **Constraints for X:** The components must be C₆ cyclic compounds (since they hydrogenate to cyclohexane), they must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), and they must not have conjugated multiple bonds. Their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n*   **Plausible Candidates:** The two compounds that fit this description are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆ rings.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated double bonds, satisfying the condition.

It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis**:\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` leads to the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   Therefore, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point**: A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion**: Given that Z is a common solvent, the most logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification is unanimously and correctly made by all candidate answers.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Information**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It contains Z (cyclohexane), does not decolorize bromine water, and its complete hydrogenation gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis**:\n    *   One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   The other component must also have a C₆ carbon skeleton, as hydrogenation of the entire mixture yields only cyclohexane.\n    *   This second component does not decolorize bromine water, which means it is either saturated or aromatic. Since it must be different from cyclohexane, it cannot be another saturated C₆ isomer.\n    *   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation, which is a hydrogen transfer. This strongly suggests that if one product is the fully hydrogenated compound (cyclohexane), the other is the fully dehydrogenated compound (benzene).\n*   **Conclusion**: The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This conclusion is also consistent across all candidate answers.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis**: The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point**: The most direct way to solve the problem is to apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms.

It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving gives `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point:** A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated and react with hydrogen.\n*   **Conclusion:** The problem states Z is a common solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula (n=6) and all other descriptions.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\n*   **Information Given:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It contains Z (cyclohexane) and does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene; it must be saturated or aromatic. As it is not cyclohexane itself, the only remaining possibility is that it is aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point:** The aromatic compound with a C₆ skeleton is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature with a catalyst), which is consistent with the problem statement.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer\n\n*   **Information Given:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A from X) + (Component B from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The most direct way to solve the problem is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation. This allows us to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X without needing to know the exact identity of its components.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional but Confirms Consistency)\n\n*   **Information Given:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds. They both hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   **Analysis:** We need two different, non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated.\n*   **Verification:** The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This pair of compounds fits all the given constraints and confirms that the result obtained from the conservation law is chemically sound.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The analysis consistently shows this number to be 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a \"widely used as a solvent\".\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion:** The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits the formula and all the given descriptions. Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** Since one component is cyclohexane, the other must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as the entire mixture hydrogenates to only cyclohexane. This second component does not decolorize bromine water, which means it is not a typical alkene; it is either saturated or aromatic. Since it must be different from cyclohexane but still hydrogenate to it, it must be the corresponding aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is benzene (C₆H₆). Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Find the Answer\nThe core of the problem is understanding the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** `Component X₁ + Component X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The law of conservation of atoms is the key to solving this problem without needing to identify the exact components of X. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation.\n*   **Calculation:** We can sum the hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional)\nWe can check if there are plausible molecules for mixture X that fit all the conditions.\n*   **Conditions for X:** Components must be C₆ cyclic compounds, unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), and have no conjugated bonds. Their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n*   **Plausible Components:** Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Sum of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆ rings.\n    *   Neither has conjugated bonds (1,3-cyclohexadiene is the conjugated isomer and is excluded by the problem statement).\n*   This confirms that the chemical scenario is entirely consistent.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The calculation based on the conservation of atoms shows this number is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a \"widely used as a solvent\".\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` leads to `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point**: A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula Cn H₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion**: The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits the formula (n=6) and all other descriptions. Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Information**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as it hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   **Careful Point**: Since the mixture does not decolorize bromine water, the second component must be saturated or aromatic. As it is different from cyclohexane, it cannot be another saturated C₆ isomer that would hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   **Conclusion**: The only logical second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane. Therefore, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X undergoes disproportionation upon heating with platinum to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis**: The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point**: The key to solving this problem is the law of conservation of atoms. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation.\n*   **Calculation**: We can sum the hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion**: By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional)\n*   **Information**: The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated), have no conjugated bonds, and both hydrogenate to form only cyclohexane.\n*   **Analysis**: This means the components must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated double bonds. The two most plausible candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The other isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus excluded.\n*   **Check**: The sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (10) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8) is 10 + 8 = 18. This is perfectly consistent with the conclusion from Step 3.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The calculation based on the conservation of atoms shows this to be 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
