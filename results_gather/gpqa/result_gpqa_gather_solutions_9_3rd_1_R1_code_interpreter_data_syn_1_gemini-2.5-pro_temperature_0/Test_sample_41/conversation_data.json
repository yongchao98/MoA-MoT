This can be solved by combining two fundamental principles of astrophysics: the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature and its orbital distance, and Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion.\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) to Orbital Distance (a):**\n    The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance.\n    *   **Physical Law:** `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Period (P) to Orbital Distance (a):**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance.\n    *   **Physical Law:** `P² ∝ a³` or `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n\n3.  **Combine the Laws to Relate Period and Temperature:**\n    We can create a direct relationship between period and temperature to solve the problem efficiently.\n    *   From the temperature law, we can write `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n    *   Substitute this into Kepler's Law: `P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2)`.\n    *   Simplifying the exponents gives the final relationship: `P ∝ 1/T_eq³`.\n    *   This means the ratio of the periods is the inverse cube of the ratio of the temperatures: `P_j / P_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)³`.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, find the overall temperature ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3 by multiplying the given ratios:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n    *   Now, use the combined relationship from Step 3 to find the period ratio `P3 / P1`:\n        `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³ = (3.22)³`\n        `P3 / P1 ≈ 33.386`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1 by a factor of approximately **33.4**. Comparing this to the options:\n    *   A) ~ 10.4\n    *   B) ~ 33.4\n    *   C) ~ 3.2\n    *   D) ~ 4.4\n    The calculated value matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the mass ratios of the planets, the specific albedo value (0.3), and mentions the TTV discovery method. This information is not needed for the calculation and serves as a distractor. The mass ratios are negligible for the standard form of Kepler's law, and the albedo value cancels out because it is the same for all three planets.\n*   **Distractor Answers:** The incorrect options are cleverly designed to match intermediate results of the calculation, which can trap someone who stops early.\n    *   **Option C (~3.2)** is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (`T_eq1 / T_eq3`).\n    *   **Option A (~10.4)** is the ratio of the orbital distances (`a3 / a1`), which is `(T_eq1 / T_eq3)² ≈ (3.22)² ≈ 10.4`.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** The core of the problem lies in correctly applying the exponents in the physical laws: `T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ²` and `P ∝ a³ᐟ²`. An error here would lead to a wrong answer.\n*   **Consistency of Agent Calculations:** While the final letter choices of the provided agents are inconsistent (likely due to shuffled option lists in their prompts), their underlying mathematical calculations are overwhelmingly consistent, all arriving at the numerical result of approximately 33.4. This provides high confidence in the numerical result.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and a first-principles approach to the problem, here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The core task is to determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet 3 (`P3`) is larger than that of Planet 1 (`P1`). This requires calculating the ratio `P3 / P1`.\n\n2.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet depends on the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star with an identical albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (`a`).\n    *   **Physical Law:** `T_eq ∝ 1 / √a`\n    *   **Ratio Form:** For any two planets `i` and `j`, this gives the relationship `a_j / a_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)²`.\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period:** Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance (`a`).\n    *   **Physical Law:** `P² ∝ a³`\n    *   **Ratio Form:** For any two planets `i` and `j`, this gives the relationship `P_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2)`.\n\n4.  **Combine Relationships and Calculate:** The most direct method is to first derive a single relationship between period and temperature.\n    *   From Step 2, we have `a ∝ 1 / T_eq²`.\n    *   Substitute this into the relationship from Step 3: `P ∝ a^(3/2) ∝ (1 / T_eq²)^(3/2)`.\n    *   Simplifying the exponents gives the final relationship: `P ∝ 1 / T_eq³`.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio we need is `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³`.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, find the overall temperature ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3 by multiplying the given ratios:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`.\n    *   Now, cube this value to find the period ratio:\n        `P3 / P1 = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated factor is approximately **33.4**.

This is a common technique to test understanding of the underlying principles. The irrelevant data includes:\n    *   The ratio of the masses between the planets.\n    *   The specific albedo value of 0.3 (the crucial fact is that the albedo is *equal* for all three planets, which allows it to cancel out).\n    *   The mention of the TTV discovery method, which is background context.\n\n*   **Distractor Options:** The incorrect options are designed to catch common mistakes or those who stop the calculation prematurely.\n    *   **Option A (~3.2)** corresponds to the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (`T_eq1 / T_eq3`), which is an intermediate step.\n    *   **Option C (~10.4)** corresponds to the ratio of the orbital distances (`a3 / a1`), which is another intermediate step (`3.22² ≈ 10.4`).\n\n*   **Correct Physical Laws:** The solution is entirely dependent on the correct application of the exponents in the two physical laws: `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)` and `P ∝ a^(3/2)`. Any error in these exponents leads to an incorrect answer. The consensus among all detailed candidate answers confirms this approach and calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute the calculation.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet 3 (P3) is larger than that of Planet 1 (P1). This means we need to calculate the ratio `P3 / P1`.\n\n2.  **Identify Relevant Physical Principles:** The solution requires two key principles from astrophysics:\n    *   **Planetary Equilibrium Temperature:** This principle relates a planet's temperature to its distance from its star.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period to its orbital distance.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Relationships:**\n    *   The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (`a`). This is because the energy absorbed from the star decreases with the square of the distance (`1/a²`), and this must be balanced by the energy radiated by the planet, which is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (`T_eq⁴`). So, `T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a²`, which simplifies to `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`.\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance (`a`), so `P² ∝ a³`, which simplifies to `P ∝ a^(3/2)`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Relationships:** We can create a single formula relating period and temperature.\n    *   From the temperature relationship, we can say `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n    *   Substituting this into Kepler's Law gives: `P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2)`.\n    *   Simplifying the exponents, we get `P ∝ 1/T_eq³`.\n    *   This gives us the final ratio: `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³`.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the overall temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` by multiplying the given ratios: `(T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)`.\n    *   Then, cube this result to find the period ratio `P3 / P1`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the mass ratios of the planets and a specific albedo value (0.3). This information is not needed for the calculation. The mass ratios are irrelevant for the simple form of Kepler's Law, and the albedo value cancels out because it is the same for all three planets.\n*   **Distractor Options:** The incorrect options correspond to intermediate steps in the calculation. For example, the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` is ~3.2 (Option A), and the orbital distance ratio `a3 / a1` is ~10.4 (Option C). It is crucial to complete all steps to arrive at the final answer.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** The solution depends on the correct application of the exponents in the physical laws (`T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)` and `P ∝ a^(3/2)`).\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the given ratios from the problem description.\ntemp_ratio_12 = 1.4  # T_eq1 / T_eq2\ntemp_ratio_23 = 2.3  # T_eq2 / T_eq3\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the overall temperature ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3.\n# T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)\ntemp_ratio_13 = temp_ratio_12 * temp_ratio_23\nprint(f\"The calculated temperature ratio (T_eq1 / T_eq3) is: {temp_ratio_13:.2f}\")\n\n# Step 3: Use the relationship between period and temperature to find the period factor.\n# The relationship is P_j / P_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)^3.\n# Therefore, P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3.\nperiod_factor = temp_ratio_13 ** 3\nprint(f\"The calculated orbital period factor (P3 / P1) is: {period_factor:.2f}\")\n\n# Step 4: Compare the result with the given options to find the correct choice.\noptions = {'A': 3.2, 'B': 4.4, 'C': 10.4, 'D': 33.4}\nfinal_choice = None\nfor choice, value in options.items():\n    # Check if the calculated factor is very close to the option value.\n    if abs(period_factor - value) < 0.1:\n        final_choice = choice\n        break\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing the result to the options:\")\nprint(\"A) ~ 3.2\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 4.4\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 10.4\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 33.4\")\n\nif final_choice:\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated value of ~{period_factor:.1f} matches option {final_choice}.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\nThe calculated value does not closely match any of the options.\")\n\nprint(f\"<<<{final_choice}>>>\")\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated temperature ratio (T_eq1 / T_eq3) is: 3.22\nThe calculated orbital period factor (P3 / P1) is: 33.39\n\nComparing the result to the options:\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 10.4\nD) ~ 33.4\n\nThe calculated value of ~33.4 matches option D.\n<<<D>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, a list of careful points, and the final answer derived from the analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem asks for the factor by which the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1. This is the ratio `P3 / P1`. To find this, we must connect the given information about equilibrium temperatures to orbital periods using fundamental physical laws.\n\n**Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) to Orbital Distance (a)**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The power absorbed is proportional to `1/a²` (where `a` is the orbital distance), and the power radiated is proportional to `T_eq⁴` (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law). In equilibrium, these are balanced.\n\n*   `T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a²`\n\nTaking the fourth root of both sides gives the relationship:\n\n*   `T_eq ∝ 1 / a^(1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`\n\nThis means a planet's temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance. For any two planets, `i` and `j`, orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the ratio of their temperatures is `T_i / T_j = √(a_j / a_i)`.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Orbital Distance (a) to Orbital Period (P)**\n\nThis relationship is described by Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance.\n\n*   `P² ∝ a³`\n\nTaking the square root gives the relationship for the period:\n\n*   `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Relationships and Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nWe can combine the two principles to find a direct relationship between period and temperature.\n\n1.  From Step 1, we can express `a` in terms of `T_eq`: `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n2.  Substitute this into the relationship from Step 2: `P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2)`.\n3.  Simplifying the exponents gives: `P ∝ 1/T_eq³`.\n\nThis shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. Therefore, the ratio of the periods for Planet 3 and Planet 1 is:\n\n*   `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³`\n\nNow, we can perform the calculation:\n\n1.  First, find the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` by multiplying the given ratios:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n\n2.  Next, cube this value to find the period ratio:\n    `P3 / P1 = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the factor is approximately **33.4**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides the mass ratios of the planets and the specific albedo value (0.3). This information is not needed for the calculation. The mass ratios are irrelevant for the standard application of Kepler's Third Law, and the albedo value cancels out because it is the same for all three planets. These are included to test understanding of the relevant physics.\n2.  **Intermediate Calculations as Distractors**: The incorrect options are cleverly chosen to match intermediate steps in the calculation.\n    *   The temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` is `~3.2`, which corresponds to option **B**.\n    *   The orbital distance ratio `a3 / a1` is `(T_eq1 / T_eq3)² = (3.22)² ≈ 10.4`, which corresponds to option **C**.\n    It is crucial to complete the entire calculation to arrive at the final period ratio.\n3.  **Correct Exponents**: The solution depends entirely on the correct application of the exponents in the physical laws: `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)` and `P ∝ a^(3/2)`. A mistake in either exponent would lead to an incorrect answer.\n4.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All provided candidate answers correctly identify the physical principles and perform the calculation, arriving at the numerical result of approximately 33.4. The inconsistencies in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) are due to the agents being presented with shuffled option lists. The unanimous agreement on the numerical value of ~33.4 confirms the calculation.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.

The code output confirms this: `Intermediate temperature ratio (T1/T3): 3.22`. This value corresponds to option **A**, which is a distractor.\n    *   An intermediate step is to calculate the ratio of the orbital distances: `a3 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)² = (3.22)² ≈ 10.37`. The code output confirms this: `Intermediate distance ratio (a3/a1): 10.37`. This value corresponds to option **D**, another distractor.\n    *   The final step is to calculate the ratio of the orbital periods: `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³ = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.39`. The code output confirms this: `Final period ratio (P3/P1): 33.39`.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The calculated factor by which the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1 is approximately **33.4**.\n\n### **Final Answer Selection**\n\nComparing the final calculated value with the given options:\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 33.4\nD) ~ 10.4\n\nThe result `33.39` clearly matches option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires us to find the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet 3 and Planet 1 (`P3 / P1`) using their temperature and mass ratios.

This is because the energy absorbed from the star decreases with the square of the distance (`1/a²`), and this must be balanced by the energy radiated by the planet, which is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (`T_eq⁴`).

This is the ratio `P3 / P1`. To find this, we must connect the given information about equilibrium temperatures to orbital periods using fundamental physical laws.\n\n**Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) to Orbital Distance (a)**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The power absorbed is proportional to `1/a²` (where `a` is the orbital distance), and the power radiated is proportional to `T_eq⁴` (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law). In equilibrium, these are balanced.\n\n*   `T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a²`\n\nTaking the fourth root of both sides gives the relationship:\n\n*   `T_eq ∝ 1 / a^(1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`\n\nThis means a planet's temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance. For any two planets, `i` and `j`, orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the ratio of their temperatures is `T_i / T_j = √(a_j / a_i)`.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Orbital Distance (a) to Orbital Period (P)**\n\nThis relationship is described by Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance.\n\n*   `P² ∝ a³`\n\nTaking the square root gives the relationship for the period:\n\n*   `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Relationships and Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nWe can combine the two principles to find a direct relationship between period and temperature.\n\n1.  From Step 1, we can express `a` in terms of `T_eq`: `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n2.  Substitute this into the relationship from Step 2: `P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2)`.\n3.  Simplifying the exponents gives: `P ∝ 1/T_eq³`.\n\nThis shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. Therefore, the ratio of the periods for Planet 3 and Planet 1 is:\n\n*   `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³`\n\nNow, we can perform the calculation:\n\n1.  First, find the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` by multiplying the given ratios:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n\n2.  Next, cube this value to find the period ratio:\n    `P3 / P1 = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the factor is approximately **33.4**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides the mass ratios of the planets and the specific albedo value (0.3). This information is not needed for the calculation. The mass ratios are irrelevant for the standard application of Kepler's Third Law, and the albedo value cancels out because it is the same for all three planets. These are included to test understanding of the relevant physics.\n2.  **Intermediate Calculations as Distractors**: The incorrect options are cleverly chosen to match intermediate steps in the calculation.\n    *   The temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` is `~3.2`, which corresponds to option **B**.\n    *   The orbital distance ratio `a3 / a1` is `(T_eq1 / T_eq3)² = (3.22)² ≈ 10.4`, which corresponds to option **C**.\n    It is crucial to complete the entire calculation to arrive at the final period ratio.\n3.  **Correct Exponents**: The solution depends entirely on the correct application of the exponents in the physical laws: `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)` and `P ∝ a^(3/2)`. A mistake in either exponent would lead to an incorrect answer.\n4.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All provided candidate answers correctly identify the physical principles and perform the calculation, arriving at the numerical result of approximately 33.4.

This can be solved by combining two fundamental principles of astrophysics: the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature and its orbital distance, and Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion.\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) to Orbital Distance (a):**\n    The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The power absorbed is proportional to `1/a²`, where `a` is the orbital distance. The power radiated is proportional to `T_eq⁴` (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law). In equilibrium, these are balanced, leading to the relationship:\n    `T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a²`\n    Taking the fourth root of both sides gives the key proportionality:\n    `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`\n    This means a planet's equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance. For any two planets, `i` and `j`, orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the ratio of their periods is `P_j / P_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)³`.\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Period (P) to Orbital Distance (a):**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance:\n    `P² ∝ a³`\n    This can be expressed as a ratio: `P_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2)`.\n\n3.  **Combine the Principles and Calculate:**\n    The most direct method is to first derive a relationship between period and temperature.\n    *   From Step 1, we can write `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n    *   Substituting this into the relationship from Step 2 gives: `P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2) = 1/T_eq³`.\n    *   This gives us a direct relationship for the ratio of the periods: `P_j / P_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)³`.\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   We need to find the ratio `P3 / P1`, which is equal to `(T_eq1 / T_eq3)³`.\n    *   First, we find the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` by multiplying the given intermediate ratios:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`.\n    *   Now, we cube this value to find the period ratio:\n        `P3 / P1 = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386`.\n\nRounding the result gives approximately **33.4**.

This information is not needed for the calculation and serves as a distractor. The mass ratios are negligible in the standard application of Kepler's law, and the albedo value cancels out because it is the same for all three planets.\n*   **Distractor Answers:** The incorrect options are designed to catch common mistakes by matching intermediate steps in the calculation.\n    *   The value `~3.2` (Option D) is the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3`.\n    *   The value `~10.4` (Option A) is the orbital distance ratio `a3 / a1`, which is `(3.22)²`.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** The solution is critically dependent on using the correct exponents in the physical laws: `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)` and `P ∝ a^(3/2)`.

This can be solved by linking the given equilibrium temperature ratios to the orbital periods using two fundamental laws of astrophysics.\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) to Orbital Distance (a):**\n    The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star with an identical albedo, the equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (`a`).\n    *   **Physical Law:** `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`\n    *   **Ratio Form:** For any two planets, `i` and `j`, this relationship can be written as `T_i / T_j = √(a_j / a_i)`.\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance (a) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance (`a`).\n    *   **Physical Law:** `P² ∝ a³`\n    *   **Ratio Form:** For any two planets, `i` and `j`, this can be written as `P_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2)`.\n\n3.  **Combine Relationships and Calculate:**\n    The most direct method is to first derive a single relationship between period and temperature.\n    *   From Step 1, we can express the distance ratio as `a_j / a_i = (T_i / T_j)²`.\n    *   Substitute this into the period ratio equation from Step 2: `P_j / P_i = [ (T_i / T_j)² ]^(3/2)`.\n    *   Simplifying the exponents (2 * 3/2 = 3) gives the direct relationship: `P_j / P_i = (T_i / T_j)³`.\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   We need to find the ratio `P3 / P1`, which equals `(T1 / T3)³`.\n    *   First, calculate the temperature ratio `T1 / T3` by multiplying the given intermediate ratios:\n        `T1 / T3 = (T1 / T2) * (T2 / T3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n    *   Now, cube this value to find the period ratio:\n        `P3 / P1 = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386`\n\nRounding the result, the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1 by a factor of approximately **33.4**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem deliberately includes information that is not needed for the calculation.

For planets orbiting the same star with an identical albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (a).\n    *   **Physical Law:** `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`\n    *   **Ratio Form:** For any two planets, `i` and `j`, this means `a_j / a_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)²`.\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period:** Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance (a).\n    *   **Physical Law:** `P² ∝ a³`\n    *   **Ratio Form:** For any two planets, `i` and `j`, this means `P_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2)`.\n\n4.  **Combine Principles and Calculate:** The most direct method is to first derive a single relationship between period and temperature.\n    *   From Step 2, we can write `a ∝ T_eq⁻²`.\n    *   Substitute this into the relationship from Step 3: `P ∝ a^(3/2) ∝ (T_eq⁻²)^(3/2) = T_eq⁻³`.\n    *   This gives the direct relationship: `P_j / P_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)³`.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   First, find the overall temperature ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3 (`T_eq1 / T_eq3`):\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`.\n    *   Now, use the combined relationship from Step 4 to find the period ratio (`P3 / P1`):\n        `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³ = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1 by a factor of approximately **33.4**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem includes several pieces of information that are not needed for the calculation. This is a common technique to test for a solid understanding of the underlying principles.\n    *   **Mass Ratios and TTV Method:** The mass ratios and the mention of the Transit-Timing Variation (TTV) method are distractors. The calculation relies on the simplified form of Kepler's Third Law, which assumes planetary masses are negligible compared to the star's mass.\n    *   **Specific Albedo Value:** The specific albedo value of 0.3 is not needed. The crucial piece of information is that the albedo is *the same* for all three planets, which allows this term to cancel out when using ratios.\n\n*   **Distractor Options:** The incorrect answer choices are cleverly designed to match intermediate results from the calculation.\n    *   **Option D (~3.2)** corresponds to the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3`.\n    *   **Option A (~10.4)** corresponds to the orbital distance ratio `a3 / a1`, which is `(3.22)²`.\n    It is essential to complete the entire calculation to arrive at the final period ratio.\n\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** All 15 candidate answers correctly identify the physical laws and perform the calculation to arrive at the numerical result of ~33.4. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to inconsistent option lists they were working with and should be disregarded.

This requires calculating the ratio P3 / P1.\n\n2.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (`a`).\n    *   **Physical Law:** `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`\n    *   From this, we can derive the relationship between the ratio of orbital distances and the ratio of temperatures for any two planets, `i` and `j`: `a_j / a_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)²`.\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Period to Orbital Distance:** Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance (`a`).\n    *   **Physical Law:** `P² ∝ a³`\n    *   This gives the relationship for the ratio of periods: `P_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2)`.\n\n4.  **Combine Principles and Calculate:** We can combine these two physical laws to create a direct relationship between orbital period and equilibrium temperature.\n    *   Substitute the expression for the distance ratio from Step 2 into the period ratio equation from Step 3:\n        `P_j / P_i = [ (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)² ]^(3/2)`\n    *   Simplifying the exponents (2 * 3/2 = 3) gives the final relationship:\n        `P_j / P_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)³`\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   We need to find the ratio `P3 / P1`, which equals `(T_eq1 / T_eq3)³`.\n    *   First, calculate the overall temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` by multiplying the given intermediate ratios:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n    *   Now, cube this value to find the period ratio:\n        `P3 / P1 = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1 by a factor of approximately **33.4**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the mass ratios of the planets and a specific albedo value (0.3). This information is not needed for the calculation. The mass ratios are irrelevant because Kepler's Third Law in its simple form assumes planetary masses are negligible compared to the star's mass. The specific albedo value is irrelevant because it is the same for all three planets, causing it to cancel out when ratios are taken.\n*   **Intermediate Calculations as Distractors:** The options provided are designed to catch common mistakes or premature conclusions.\n    *   The ratio of the temperatures `T_eq1 / T_eq3` is ~3.2, which matches option **C**.

This is also an intermediate step.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** The final relationship between period and temperature is `P ∝ T_eq⁻³`. It is crucial to correctly derive this from `T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ²` and `P ∝ a³ᐟ²`.\n*   **Consistency of Analysis:** The vast majority of the candidate answers correctly identified the physical principles and performed the calculation, arriving at the numerical result of ~33.4.
