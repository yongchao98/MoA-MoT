The probability of a system in one eigenstate being measured to be in an orthogonal state is zero.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The physical reasoning unanimously leads to a probability of 0. It is crucial to correctly match this numerical result to the given multiple-choice options. In this case, the value 0 corresponds to option A. Many of the candidate answers made errors at this final step.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first break down the problem using the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the rules for adding angular momentum. I will identify the quantum numbers of the initial state and the desired final state. Then, I will apply the fundamental selection rule that governs such measurements. Based on this physical principle, I will determine the probability.\n\nThe candidate answers all seem to agree on the physical reasoning but differ in their final choice, likely due to misinterpreting the options provided in the question. My analysis will confirm the physics and then carefully map the result to the correct option.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script to formalize this step-by-step logical deduction. The script will define the initial and final state quantum numbers, apply the selection rule, calculate the probability, and then identify the correct choice from the given options.\n\nHere are the detailed steps of my analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State**: The system is in the coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The most important quantum number for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, $m = -1$. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Desired Measurement**: The question asks for the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the system in a state where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation Law**: A core principle of angular momentum addition is the conservation of the z-component, which leads to the selection rule: $m = m_1 + m_2$. A measurement is only possible if the sum of the individual measured quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) equals the total quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**:\n    *   From the initial state, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired measurement, the sum is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Comparing the two, we see that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The selection rule is violated. This means the desired measurement outcome is physically impossible. The initial state is orthogonal to the state we want to measure. Therefore, the probability of this measurement is exactly 0.\n\n6.  **Match to Options**: The given options are A) 1, B) 1/2, C) 0, D) 2/3.

The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state according to this conservation law.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired final state, we calculate the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers: **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    We compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum required by the desired final state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$).

The most critical piece of information from this state is the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum, which is **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** A measurement is made of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the joint probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$.

This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both individual z-components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This desired outcome corresponds to finding the system in the *uncoupled* state described by the quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Governing Physical Principle:**\n    The fundamental principle that connects the coupled and uncoupled bases is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state according to this selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired measurement outcome, we calculate the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Draw the Conclusion:**\n    We compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum required by the desired final state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$). Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the selection rule is violated. This means the desired outcome is physically impossible as it would violate the conservation of angular momentum. Therefore, the probability of this measurement is exactly 0.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem is designed to test the understanding of the relationship between the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$), where total angular momentum is well-defined, and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$), where individual z-components are well-defined.\n*   **The Selection Rule is Absolute:** The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a strict conservation law. If it is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects the initial and final states is exactly zero, and thus the probability is zero. It is not an approximation.\n*   **Eigenstates and Orthogonality:** An alternative way to understand this is to recognize that the initial state $|2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. In quantum mechanics, eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) that correspond to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of a system in one state being measured in an orthogonal state is zero.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The unanimous physical conclusion from all candidate answers is that the probability is 0. The provided options are A) 1/2, B) 0, C) 1, D) 2/3. The correct choice is therefore B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct reasoning from the provided answers and identifying the crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and its Properties:** The system of two electrons is in the *coupled* angular momentum state given by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ (p-orbitals).\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   The most important piece of information for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This quantum number corresponds to the z-component of the *total* angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the $L_z$ operator with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    *   Therefore, the measurement is asking for the probability of finding the system in the *uncoupled* state described by the quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition:** A core principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum when adding angular momenta. This is expressed as a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    For a transition or projection from a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ to an uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ to be possible (i.e., have a non-zero probability), this condition must be met.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state, we calculate the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We then compare these two values: Is $m = m_1 + m_2$? Is $-1 = -2$? The condition is not met.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is a superposition of uncoupled states, but it only contains components where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is not part of this superposition. Therefore, the two states are orthogonal, and the probability of measuring this outcome is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem is set up with the initial state in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and asks about a measurement outcome in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The key to solving the problem is understanding the strict relationship between them.\n*   **The Selection Rule is Absolute:** The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a direct consequence of the operator identity $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.

The desired final state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.

It is crucial to correctly match this numerical result to the given multiple-choice options. In this case, the value 0 corresponds to option A. Many of the candidate answers made errors at this final step.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first break down the problem using the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the rules for adding angular momentum. I will identify the quantum numbers of the initial state and the desired final state. Then, I will apply the fundamental selection rule that governs such measurements. Based on this physical principle, I will determine the probability.\n\nThe candidate answers all seem to agree on the physical reasoning but differ in their final choice, likely due to misinterpreting the options provided in the question. My analysis will confirm the physics and then carefully map the result to the correct option.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script to formalize this step-by-step logical deduction. The script will define the initial and final state quantum numbers, apply the selection rule, calculate the probability, and then identify the correct choice from the given options.\n\nHere are the detailed steps of my analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State**: The system is in the coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The most important quantum number for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, $m = -1$. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Desired Measurement**: The question asks for the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the system in a state where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation Law**: A core principle of angular momentum addition is the conservation of the z-component, which leads to the selection rule: $m = m_1 + m_2$. A measurement is only possible if the sum of the individual measured quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) equals the total quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**:\n    *   From the initial state, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired measurement, the sum is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Comparing the two, we see that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The selection rule is violated.

The most important quantum number for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This value represents the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum of the system. The state is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a well-defined eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This desired outcome corresponds to finding the system in the *uncoupled* state described by the quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:**\n    A core principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This operator relationship leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system by applying the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, we calculate the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers: **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    We compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum required by the desired final state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$). Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (because $-1 \\neq -2$), the selection rule is violated. This means the desired measurement outcome is physically impossible for a system in the given initial state. Therefore, the probability of this measurement is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem is set up with the initial state in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and asks about a measurement outcome in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The key to solving the problem is understanding the strict relationship between these two bases.\n*   **The Selection Rule is Absolute:** The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a direct consequence of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. It is not an approximation. If the rule is not satisfied, the probability of that specific outcome is exactly zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to view this is that the initial state $|2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of a system in one eigenstate being measured in an orthogonal state is zero.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The calculated probability is 0. Looking at the provided options: A) 2/3, B) 0, C) 1/2, D) 1. The correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and its Properties:**\n    The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$. The system is in a *coupled* angular momentum state, given by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    The most important piece of information from this state is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This desired outcome corresponds to finding the system in the *uncoupled* state described by the quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:**\n    A core principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state according to this conservation law.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired final state, we calculate the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers: **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    We compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum required by the desired final state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$). Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the selection rule is violated. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. Therefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem is a classic test of understanding the relationship between the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The initial state is given in the former, while the measurement is performed in the latter.\n*   **The Selection Rule is Absolute:** The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not an approximation; it is a strict requirement. If it is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects the initial and final states is exactly zero, and thus the probability is zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to view this is to recognize that the initial state $|2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. A fundamental theorem of quantum mechanics states that eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. The probability of a system in one eigenstate being measured to be in another, orthogonal eigenstate is zero.\n\nBased on this analysis, the probability is 0. Matching this result to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 2/3\nC) 1\nD) 1/2\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers and the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and its Properties:** The system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The most critical piece of information from this state is the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum, which is **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** A measurement is made of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the joint probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    The final state we are testing for is the uncoupled state described by $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Principle:** A core principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    For a measurement to be possible, the sum of the individual measured quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) must equal the total quantum number ($m$) of the system's initial state.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   From the initial state, we have **$m = -1$**.\n    *   From the desired final state, we have the sum **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n    *   Comparing the two values, we see that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The desired measurement outcome violates the law of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Therefore, the event is physically impossible. The probability of measuring an outcome that is forbidden by a conservation law is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem is designed to test the understanding of the relationship between the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$), where total angular momentum is well-defined, and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$), where individual components are well-defined. The initial state is given in one basis, and the measurement outcome is described in the other.\n*   **The $m = m_1 + m_2$ Selection Rule:** This is an absolute rule derived from the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. If it is violated, the probability is zero, and no further calculation (e.g., finding Clebsch-Gordan coefficients) is necessary.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. In quantum mechanics, eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal.
