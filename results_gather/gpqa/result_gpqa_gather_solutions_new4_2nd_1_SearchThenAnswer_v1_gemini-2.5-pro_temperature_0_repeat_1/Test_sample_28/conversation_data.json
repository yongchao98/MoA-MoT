A non-functional protein cannot perform its enzymatic role, thus preventing the synthesis of the compound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and the Biology**\nThe process of creating a protein from a gene involves translating the DNA sequence into a chain of amino acids. This translation is done by reading the DNA in three-base units called codons. The process starts at a \"start\" codon (`ATG`) and ends at a \"stop\" codon (`TGA`, `TAA`, or `TAG`). The most effective way to \"knock out\" a gene's function is to introduce a mutation that either stops this process very early or scrambles the sequence so badly that a functional protein cannot be made.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nFirst, let's establish the correct reading frame and the initial amino acid sequence of the functional protein.\n*   **Intact DNA:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` `ACT`...-3’\n*   **Translated Protein:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n    *   The protein sequence begins: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant and Its Effect**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TT**C** TA**C** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein could still be partially or fully functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TT**C** T**AA** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**. This mutation causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely.\n    *   **Effect:** The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A protein this severely truncated is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most definitive way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TA**C** GCT GGT G**TC**...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence contains two changes: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** These are two separate **missense mutations**. While having two amino acid changes increases the chance of disrupting function compared to one, it is still less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TA**C** GCT **---** ACT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence has a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion**. Because a full codon (3 bases) is removed, the reading frame for the rest of the gene remains intact. The protein will be missing one amino acid and have another one changed. This is disruptive but less severe than a nonsense mutation that truncates almost the entire protein.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nComparing the potential outcomes:\n*   Mutants 1, 3, and 4 result in proteins with altered or missing amino acids but are likely to be full-length or near full-length. Their function might be reduced or altered, but not necessarily eliminated.\n*   Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). This leads to the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein fragment.\n\nTherefore, the mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by completely inactivating the responsible enzyme. Mutant 2 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot carry out its enzymatic activity, thus preventing the synthesis of the compound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and the Genetic Code**\nThe objective is to \"knock out\" the gene's function. The most effective way to do this is to introduce a mutation that either stops the protein from being made correctly or drastically alters its structure. The genetic code is read in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene**\nFirst, let's establish the initial amino acid sequence of the normal, functional protein.\n*   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` `ACT`...-3’\n*   **Amino Acid Sequence:**\n    *   `ATG` = Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` = Phenylalanine\n    *   `CTC` = Leucine\n    *   `GCT` = Alanine\n    *   The protein begins: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant Mutation**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TT**C** TA**C** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). The second codon `TTT` also changes to `TTC`, but both code for Phenylalanine, making it a silent change.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein could still be partially or fully active.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TT**C** T**AA** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a **STOP codon**. This signals the cell to stop protein synthesis. Because this stop codon appears at the third position, the resulting \"protein\" will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). This severely truncated peptide is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TA**C** GCT GGT G**TC**...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** This sequence contains two amino acid substitutions. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** These are two **missense mutations**. While multiple changes are more likely to disrupt function than a single one, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT TA**C** GCT **A**CT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** Comparing the mutant (`...TAC GCT ACT...`) to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), we can see two changes: a missense mutation where `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the deletion of the `GGT` codon (Glycine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion**. Since a full codon (3 bases) is removed, the reading frame for the rest of the gene is preserved. The resulting protein is missing one amino acid and has another one changed. This is disruptive but less severe than a nonsense mutation that truncates the entire protein.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the effects, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most catastrophic for the protein's synthesis. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be produced. This is the most reliable and probable method among the choices to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutations (missense and in-frame deletion) might only alter the protein's function, not necessarily eliminate it.\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the mutation that is most likely to make the gene non-functional. A non-functional gene will not produce the protein responsible for synthesizing the anti-nutritional compound, thus eliminating it. The most effective way to create a non-functional protein is to introduce a mutation that either stops protein synthesis prematurely (a nonsense mutation) or scrambles the entire amino acid sequence (a frameshift mutation).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** The gene sequence must be read in groups of three nucleotides, called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n    *   **Intact Gene Sequence:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` `ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Translation into Amino Acids:**\n        *   `ATG` = Methionine (Start)\n        *   `TTT` = Phenylalanine\n        *   `CTC` = Leucine\n        *   `GCT` = Alanine\n    *   The protein begins with the sequence: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Mutant:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG` `TTC` `TAC` `GCT`...-3’\n        *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   **Type of Mutation:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG` `TTC` `TAA` `GCT`...-3’\n        *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   **Type of Mutation:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely. The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe) and will be completely non-functional. This is the most definitive way to knock out the gene's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `TAC` `GCT` `GGT` `GTC`...-3’\n        *   **Change:** This sequence has two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n        *   **Type of Mutation:** These are two **missense mutations**. While multiple changes are more likely to disrupt function than a single one, it is still less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `TAC` `GCT` `ACT`...-3’\n        *   **Change:** Comparing to the intact sequence (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the codon `GGT` has been deleted, and the codon `CTC` has been changed to `TAC`.\n        *   **Type of Mutation:** This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 nucleotides). This removes one amino acid and changes another but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This is less disruptive than a nonsense mutation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the third position of the protein. This will result in a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most probable and effective way to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound among the given choices. The option corresponding to Mutant 2 is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that is most likely to render a gene non-functional. The gene produces a protein that synthesizes an anti-nutritional compound. A non-functional protein will not be able to synthesize the compound, thus achieving the goal.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Likely Effects**\nTo compare the mutants, we must understand the impact of different types of point mutations on protein function:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes a single nucleotide, resulting in a different amino acid. The effect is variable; it might have no impact, alter the protein's function, or completely inactivate it. It is not the most reliable way to knock out a gene.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a single nucleotide, resulting in a premature stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This causes protein synthesis to halt, producing a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional. This is a highly effective method for gene knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or inserts a number of nucleotides that is a multiple of three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This can be disruptive but is generally less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This alters the entire reading frame downstream of the mutation, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a highly effective knockout method.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant Sequence**\nWe will analyze the DNA sequence of each mutant by breaking it into codons (groups of three nucleotides) and comparing it to the intact gene. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Translation: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...`\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   Effect: This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to inactivate the protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   Effect: This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will stop after only two amino acids (Met-Phe). The resulting dipeptide will be completely non-functional. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Change: This mutant has two changes: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   Effect: This results in two **missense mutations**. While more disruptive than one, it is still less certain to cause complete inactivation than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Change: Comparing to the intact sequence (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   Effect: This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 nucleotides). The protein will be missing one amino acid and have another changed. While this is disruptive, it is less severe than a nonsense mutation that truncates almost the entire protein.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nComparing the four mutations, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and the most certain to result in a non-functional protein. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, useless fragment of the protein is ever made. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the function of the gene and, consequently, the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe question asks to choose the option corresponding to the best mutant.\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 1\nC) Mutant 2\nD) Mutant 3\n\nBased on our analysis, Mutant 2 is the correct choice. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein, which is encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to find a mutation that creates a non-functional protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Likely Effects**\nTo understand which mutation is most effective, we need to consider the different types of point mutations and their impact on protein synthesis:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** A change in a single nucleotide that results in a different amino acid. This may or may not inactivate the protein. Its effect is often unpredictable.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** A change in a nucleotide that does not change the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in a nucleotide that results in a premature **stop codon** (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This causes protein synthesis to halt, producing a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides in a number not divisible by three. This alters the \"reading frame,\" scrambling the entire amino acid sequence from that point on and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a very effective way to create a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of nucleotides in a number divisible by three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This can be disruptive but is generally less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe genetic code is read in triplets (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Translation: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...`\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   Effect: This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a protein with one different amino acid. This might not be enough to inactivate the protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Effect: This is a **nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a stop codon. Protein synthesis will terminate after only two amino acids (Met-Phe). The resulting dipeptide will be completely non-functional. This is the most definitive way to knock out the gene's function among the choices.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Change: This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine). While two changes are more disruptive than one, it is still less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Change: This involves a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the `GGT` codon for Glycine is removed). While this alters the protein by changing one amino acid and removing another, the reading frame is preserved. This is less disruptive than a nonsense mutation that truncates the vast majority of the protein.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nComparing the potential effects, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and the most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a full-length protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct option corresponding to Mutant 2 is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot carry out its enzymatic activity, thus preventing the synthesis of the compound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** The gene sequence starts with `5’-ATG...`, which is the universal start codon for Methionine. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons. Let's break down the beginning of the intact gene's sequence into codons and translate them into amino acids.\n    *   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Amino Acids:**\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - Start\n        *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n        *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n        *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   The functional protein begins with the sequence: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n2.  **Analyze the Effect of Each Mutation:** We will compare each mutant sequence to the intact sequence to understand the type of mutation and its likely effect on the protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. While this change *could* disrupt the protein's function, it is not guaranteed. The protein might still be partially or fully functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This mutation causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely.\n        *   **Effect:** The resulting protein will be extremely short, consisting of only two amino acids (Met-Phe). A protein this truncated is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.

This removes one amino acid and changes another but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a nonsense mutation.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The goal is to find the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the protein's function.\n    *   Mutants 1, 3, and 4 cause amino acid substitutions or deletions, which may or may not inactivate the protein.\n    *   Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene.

This is the most reliable and definitive way to ensure the gene product is inactive.\n\nTherefore, the mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable one to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein.

The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This causes protein synthesis to stop prematurely. The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe) and will be completely non-functional. This is a highly effective way to knock out a gene.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT **T**ACG...-3’\n        *   **Change:** A single nucleotide (`T`) has been inserted after the second codon.\n        *   **Type:** This is a **frameshift mutation**. The insertion shifts the reading frame, causing all subsequent codons to be misread (`ATG TTT TAC GCT...` becomes `ATG TTT T ACG CTG...`). This scrambles the entire amino acid sequence from that point on and usually leads to a premature stop codon. This is also a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT **TAC GCT ACT**...-3’\n        *   **Change:** Comparing to the intact sequence (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), this mutant has a change from `CTC` to `TAC` (missense) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n        *   **Type:** This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion**. Since a full codon (3 bases) is deleted, the reading frame is preserved. This results in a protein with one amino acid changed and one deleted, which is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both Mutant 2 (nonsense) and Mutant 3 (frameshift) are excellent candidates for eliminating the gene's function.

Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nTo predict the outcome, we must understand the impact of different DNA mutations on the final protein product:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes a single amino acid. This *might* disrupt the protein's function, but it's not guaranteed. The effect depends on how critical the specific amino acid is to the protein's structure and active site.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA sequence but not the amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a **stop codon** (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated (shortened) protein. If this happens early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost certainly non-functional. This is a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides in a number that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a highly effective knockout method.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that is a multiple of three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This is generally less disruptive than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**3. Analyze the Gene Sequences**\nLet's break down the start of the intact gene into codons (three-base units) and see what amino acids they code for. The sequence starts with `ATG`, the universal start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` `ACT`...-3’\n*   **Protein Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TT**C** TA**C** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a protein with one different amino acid. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TT**C** T**AA** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a stop codon. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which will be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT T**AC** GCT GGT G**TC**...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence contains two changes: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   **Type:** This represents two **missense mutations**. While more disruptive than one, it is still less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT T**AC** GCT **ACT**...-3’\n    *   **Change:** Comparing to the intact sequence (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), this mutant has changed `CTC` to `TAC` and deleted the `GGT` codon.\n    *   **Type:** This is a combination of a **missense mutation** (Leucine to Tyrosine) and an **in-frame deletion** (the Glycine amino acid is removed). Because a full codon (3 bases) is deleted, the reading frame is preserved. This is less disruptive than a nonsense mutation.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nComparing the potential effects, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and definitive. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). This guarantees that a full-length, functional protein cannot be produced. The other mutations (missense and in-frame deletion) might alter the protein but are far less likely to completely eliminate its function.\n\nTherefore, the mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation that will most reliably render the gene's protein product non-functional. A non-functional protein cannot synthesize the compound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to create a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation, which completely eliminates the function of the protein encoded by the gene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** The gene sequence is read in three-nucleotide groups called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n    *   **Intact Gene Sequence:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` `ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Translation into Amino Acids:**\n        *   `ATG` = Methionine (Start)\n        *   `TTT` = Phenylalanine\n        *   `CTC` = Leucine\n        *   `GCT` = Alanine\n    *   The functional protein begins with the amino acid sequence: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Mutant's Effect:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TT**C** TA**C** GCT...-3’\n        *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein could still be partially or fully active.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TT**C** T**AA** GCT...-3’\n        *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**.\n        *   **Effect:** This mutation causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely. The resulting \"protein\" would only be two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A severely truncated product like this is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT T**AC** GCT GGT G**TC**...-3’\n        *   **Change:** This sequence contains two changes: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n        *   **Mutation Type:** These are two separate **missense mutations**. While having two amino acid changes is more likely to be disruptive than one, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT T**AC** GCT **ACT**...-3’\n        *   **Change:** This involves a change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine) and a deletion of the `GGT` (Glycine) codon.\n        *   **Mutation Type:** This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. Because a full codon (3 bases) is deleted, the reading frame for the rest of the gene remains intact. The resulting protein is missing one amino acid and has another one changed. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a nonsense mutation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The most effective way to eliminate a protein's function is to prevent it from being made correctly. The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). This ensures that only a tiny, non-functional fragment of the protein is synthesized. This is the most reliable and probable method among the choices to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct option corresponding to Mutant 2 is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot carry out its enzymatic activity, thus preventing the synthesis of the compound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and Mutation Types**\nThe objective is to \"knock out\" the gene's function. The most effective mutations for this purpose are those that cause the most significant disruption to the protein's synthesis or structure. The hierarchy of mutation severity is generally as follows:\n*   **Nonsense mutation:** Introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated (shortened) and almost always non-functional protein. This is a highly effective method.\n*   **Frameshift mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also highly effective.\n*   **Missense mutation:** Substitutes one amino acid for another. This may or may not affect protein function and is less reliable for knocking out a gene.\n*   **Silent mutation:** A nucleotide change that does not alter the amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene**\nFirst, we establish the reading frame from the start codon `ATG`. The sequence is read in triplets (codons).\n*   **Intact Gene:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` `ACT`...-3’\n*   **Protein Translation:** Methionine (Met) - Phenylalanine (Phe) - Leucine (Leu) - Alanine (Ala)...\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG` `TTC` `TAC` `GCT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a single amino acid substitution. This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG` `TTC` `TAA` `GCT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a stop codon. This will cause protein synthesis to terminate after only two amino acids (Met-Phe). The resulting peptide will be extremely short and completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `TAC` `GCT` `GGT` `GTC`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence contains two amino acid substitutions: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** These are two **missense mutations**. While more disruptive than one, this is still less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `TAC` `GCT` `ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence involves a change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine) and a deletion of the `GGT` (Glycine) codon.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. Because a full codon (3 nucleotides) is deleted, the reading frame is not shifted. The resulting protein is missing one amino acid and has another substituted. This is less disruptive than a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the third position of the gene. This will halt protein synthesis almost immediately, resulting in a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most definitive and reliable way among the choices to eliminate the gene's function and, consequently, the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein.

It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon), ensuring that a functional, full-length protein cannot be made.

Therefore, the mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound produced by a specific gene. The most effective way to achieve this is to introduce a mutation that renders the protein encoded by this gene completely non-functional. This is often called a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Likely Effects**\nTo evaluate the mutants, we must understand the impact of different mutation types:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes a single nucleotide, resulting in a different amino acid. This may or may not inactivate the protein. Its effect is often unpredictable.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes a nucleotide but does not change the resulting amino acid. It has no effect on the protein sequence.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a nucleotide to create a premature \"stop\" codon (like TAA, TAG, or TGA). This halts protein synthesis, creating a truncated (shortened) protein that is almost always non-functional, especially if the mutation occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides in a number that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence from that point onward and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of nucleotides in a multiple of three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This can be disruptive but is generally less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nFirst, we must establish the reading frame of the intact gene by breaking the sequence into three-letter codons, starting with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` `ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine - Threonine...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TT**C** TA**C** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TT**C** T**AA** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe) that will be completely non-functional. This is the most definitive way to knock out the gene's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT **TAC** GCT GGT **GTC**...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine). These are two separate **missense mutations**. While more disruptive than one, it is still less certain to eliminate function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT **TAC** GCT **ACT**...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact sequence (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), we see two changes: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the `GGT` (Glycine) codon has been deleted. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The protein will be made but will be missing one amino acid and have another one changed. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four mutations, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and the most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a useless fragment of the protein is ever synthesized. This is the most reliable method among the choices to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Understand the Goal and the Biology**\nThe process of creating a protein from a gene involves translating the DNA sequence into a chain of amino acids. This translation is done by reading the DNA in three-base units called codons. The process starts at a \"start\" codon (`ATG`) and ends at a \"stop\" codon (`TGA`, `TAA`, or `TAG`). The most effective way to \"knock out\" a gene's function is to introduce a mutation that either stops this process very early or scrambles the sequence so badly that a functional protein cannot be made.\n\n**2.

Analyze Each Mutant and Its Effect**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TT**C** TA**C** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein could still be partially or fully functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TT**C** T**AA** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that is most likely to render a gene non-functional. The gene produces a protein that synthesizes an anti-nutritional compound. A non-functional protein will not be able to synthesize the compound, thus achieving the goal.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Likely Effects**\nTo compare the mutants, we must understand the impact of different types of point mutations on protein function:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes a single nucleotide, resulting in a different amino acid. The effect is variable; it might have no impact, alter the protein's function, or completely inactivate it. It is not the most reliable way to knock out a gene.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a single nucleotide, resulting in a premature stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This causes protein synthesis to halt, producing a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional. This is a highly effective method for gene knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or inserts a number of nucleotides that is a multiple of three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This can be disruptive but is generally less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This alters the entire reading frame downstream of the mutation, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a highly effective knockout method.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant Sequence**\nWe will analyze the DNA sequence of each mutant by breaking it into codons (groups of three nucleotides) and comparing it to the intact gene. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Translation: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...`\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   Effect: This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to inactivate the protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   Effect: This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will stop after only two amino acids (Met-Phe). The resulting dipeptide will be completely non-functional. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Change: This mutant has two changes: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   Effect: This results in two **missense mutations**. While more disruptive than one, it is still less certain to cause complete inactivation than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Change: Comparing to the intact sequence (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   Effect: This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 nucleotides). The protein will be missing one amino acid and have another changed. While this is disruptive, it is less severe than a nonsense mutation that truncates almost the entire protein.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nComparing the four mutations, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and the most certain to result in a non-functional protein. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, useless fragment of the protein is ever made. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the function of the gene and, consequently, the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe question asks to choose the option corresponding to the best mutant.\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 1\nC) Mutant 2\nD) Mutant 3\n\nBased on our analysis, Mutant 2 is the correct choice.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein, which is encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to find a mutation that creates a non-functional protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Likely Effects**\nTo understand which mutation is most effective, we need to consider the different types of point mutations and their impact on protein synthesis:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** A change in a single nucleotide that results in a different amino acid. This may or may not inactivate the protein. Its effect is often unpredictable.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** A change in a nucleotide that does not change the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in a nucleotide that results in a premature **stop codon** (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This causes protein synthesis to halt, producing a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides in a number not divisible by three. This alters the \"reading frame,\" scrambling the entire amino acid sequence from that point on and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a very effective way to create a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of nucleotides in a number divisible by three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This can be disruptive but is generally less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe genetic code is read in triplets (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Translation: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...`\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   Effect: This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a protein with one different amino acid. This might not be enough to inactivate the protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Effect: This is a **nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a stop codon. Protein synthesis will terminate after only two amino acids (Met-Phe). The resulting dipeptide will be completely non-functional. This is the most definitive way to knock out the gene's function among the choices.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Change: This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine). While two changes are more disruptive than one, it is still less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Change: This involves a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the `GGT` codon for Glycine is removed). While this alters the protein by changing one amino acid and removing another, the reading frame is preserved. This is less disruptive than a nonsense mutation that truncates the vast majority of the protein.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nComparing the potential effects, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and the most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a full-length protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct option corresponding to Mutant 2 is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot carry out its enzymatic activity, thus preventing the synthesis of the compound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** The gene sequence starts with `5’-ATG...`, which is the universal start codon for Methionine. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons. Let's break down the beginning of the intact gene's sequence into codons and translate them into amino acids.\n    *   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Amino Acids:**\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - Start\n        *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n        *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n        *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   The functional protein begins with the sequence: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n2.  **Analyze the Effect of Each Mutation:** We will compare each mutant sequence to the intact sequence to understand the type of mutation and its likely effect on the protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. While this change *could* disrupt the protein's function, it is not guaranteed. The protein might still be partially or fully functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This mutation causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely.\n        *   **Effect:** The resulting protein will be extremely short, consisting of only two amino acids (Met-Phe). A protein this truncated is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most effective way to \"knock out\" a gene's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   **Change:** This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n        *   **Mutation Type:** These are two separate **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, while having two amino acid changes increases the chance of disrupting function, it is still less certain than the definitive truncation caused by a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   **Change:** Comparing the full sequences, this mutant has a change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine) and a deletion of the `GGT` (Glycine) codon.\n        *   **Mutation Type:** This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 nucleotides). This removes one amino acid and changes another but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a nonsense mutation.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The goal is to find the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the protein's function.\n    *   Mutants 1, 3, and 4 cause amino acid substitutions or deletions, which may or may not inactivate the protein.\n    *   Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene. This will halt protein synthesis, producing a tiny, non-functional fragment. This is the most reliable and definitive way to ensure the gene product is inactive.\n\nTherefore, the mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable one to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot carry out its enzymatic activity, thus preventing the synthesis of the compound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find a \"knockout\" mutation that completely inactivates the gene. The most effective ways to do this are by introducing a nonsense mutation (a premature stop codon) or a frameshift mutation (an insertion/deletion that scrambles the protein sequence).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** The gene sequence is read in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n    *   **Intact DNA:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Translation:** This corresponds to the amino acid sequence: Methionine (Met) - Phenylalanine (Phe) - Leucine (Leu) - Alanine (Ala) - Glycine (Gly)...\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Mutant:** We will now examine each mutant to see how the change affects the resulting protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TT**C** TA**C** GCT...-3’\n        *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TT**C** T**AA** GCT...-3’\n        *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   **Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This causes protein synthesis to stop prematurely. The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe) and will be completely non-functional. This is a highly effective way to knock out a gene.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT **T**ACG...-3’\n        *   **Change:** A single nucleotide (`T`) has been inserted after the second codon.\n        *   **Type:** This is a **frameshift mutation**. The insertion shifts the reading frame, causing all subsequent codons to be misread (`ATG TTT TAC GCT...` becomes `ATG TTT T ACG CTG...`). This scrambles the entire amino acid sequence from that point on and usually leads to a premature stop codon. This is also a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT **TAC GCT ACT**...-3’\n        *   **Change:** Comparing to the intact sequence (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), this mutant has a change from `CTC` to `TAC` (missense) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n        *   **Type:** This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion**. Since a full codon (3 bases) is deleted, the reading frame is preserved. This results in a protein with one amino acid changed and one deleted, which is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both Mutant 2 (nonsense) and Mutant 3 (frameshift) are excellent candidates for eliminating the gene's function. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a definitive stop signal at the third codon, guaranteeing the production of a tiny, non-functional peptide. This is the most direct and certain method among the choices to ensure a complete loss of function.\n\nTherefore, the mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable choice to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

Therefore, the most effective strategy is to find a mutation that creates a non-functional protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nTo predict the outcome, we must understand the impact of different DNA mutations on the final protein product:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes a single amino acid. This *might* disrupt the protein's function, but it's not guaranteed. The effect depends on how critical the specific amino acid is to the protein's structure and active site.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA sequence but not the amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a **stop codon** (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated (shortened) protein. If this happens early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost certainly non-functional. This is a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides in a number that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a highly effective knockout method.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that is a multiple of three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This is generally less disruptive than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**3. Analyze the Gene Sequences**\nLet's break down the start of the intact gene into codons (three-base units) and see what amino acids they code for. The sequence starts with `ATG`, the universal start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` `ACT`...-3’\n*   **Protein Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TT**C** TA**C** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a protein with one different amino acid. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TT**C** T**AA** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a stop codon. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which will be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT T**AC** GCT GGT G**TC**...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence contains two changes: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   **Type:** This represents two **missense mutations**. While more disruptive than one, it is still less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT T**AC** GCT **ACT**...-3’\n    *   **Change:** Comparing to the intact sequence (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), this mutant has changed `CTC` to `TAC` and deleted the `GGT` codon.\n    *   **Type:** This is a combination of a **missense mutation** (Leucine to Tyrosine) and an **in-frame deletion** (the Glycine amino acid is removed). Because a full codon (3 bases) is deleted, the reading frame is preserved. This is less disruptive than a nonsense mutation.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nComparing the potential effects, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and definitive. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). This guarantees that a full-length, functional protein cannot be produced. The other mutations (missense and in-frame deletion) might alter the protein but are far less likely to completely eliminate its function.\n\nTherefore, the mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation that will most reliably render the gene's protein product non-functional. A non-functional protein cannot synthesize the compound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to create a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation, which completely eliminates the function of the protein encoded by the gene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** The gene sequence is read in three-nucleotide groups called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n    *   **Intact Gene Sequence:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` `ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Translation into Amino Acids:**\n        *   `ATG` = Methionine (Start)\n        *   `TTT` = Phenylalanine\n        *   `CTC` = Leucine\n        *   `GCT` = Alanine\n    *   The functional protein begins with the amino acid sequence: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Mutant's Effect:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TT**C** TA**C** GCT...-3’\n        *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **missense mutation**.

Because a full codon (3 bases) is deleted, the reading frame for the rest of the gene remains intact. The resulting protein is missing one amino acid and has another one changed. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a nonsense mutation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The most effective way to eliminate a protein's function is to prevent it from being made correctly. The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). This ensures that only a tiny, non-functional fragment of the protein is synthesized.

Understand the Goal and Mutation Types**\nThe objective is to \"knock out\" the gene's function. The most effective mutations for this purpose are those that cause the most significant disruption to the protein's synthesis or structure. The hierarchy of mutation severity is generally as follows:\n*   **Nonsense mutation:** Introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated (shortened) and almost always non-functional protein. This is a highly effective method.\n*   **Frameshift mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also highly effective.\n*   **Missense mutation:** Substitutes one amino acid for another. This may or may not affect protein function and is less reliable for knocking out a gene.\n*   **Silent mutation:** A nucleotide change that does not alter the amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene**\nFirst, we establish the reading frame from the start codon `ATG`.

It results in a single amino acid substitution. This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG` `TTC` `TAA` `GCT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a stop codon. This will cause protein synthesis to terminate after only two amino acids (Met-Phe).

Because a full codon (3 nucleotides) is deleted, the reading frame is not shifted. The resulting protein is missing one amino acid and has another substituted. This is less disruptive than a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the third position of the gene.

By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 1\nC) Mutant 2\nD) Mutant 3\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the gene responsible for its synthesis must be rendered non-functional. This is most effectively achieved by a mutation that causes a major disruption to the protein's structure or, more definitively, prevents its full synthesis.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala...`\n\n*   **Analysis of Mutants:**\n    1.  **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   This results in a **missense mutation**, changing the third amino acid from Leucine (`CTC`) to Tyrosine (`TAC`). This changes one amino acid in the protein, which may or may not inactivate it.\n    2.  **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   This results in a **nonsense mutation**. The third codon is changed from Leucine (`CTC`) to a **STOP codon** (`TAA`). This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be completely non-functional.\n    3.  **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   This results in two **missense mutations**, changing Leucine to Tyrosine and Threonine to Valine. While more disruptive than a single change, it is not guaranteed to inactivate the protein.\n    4.  **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   This appears to be a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (one codon is removed). This alters the protein but is less disruptive than a premature stop codon that truncates the vast majority of the protein.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most reliable way to ensure a gene produces a non-functional protein is to introduce a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) very early in its sequence. Mutant 2 is the only option that does this, guaranteeing that a functional protein cannot be made. Therefore, it is the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot carry out its enzymatic role in synthesizing the compound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and the Genetic Code**\nThe objective is to \"knock out\" the gene's function. The most effective way to do this is to introduce a mutation that prevents the synthesis of a full-length, functional protein. The genetic information in the DNA is read in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid, which are the building blocks of the protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nFirst, let's establish the reading frame and the initial amino acid sequence of the functional gene.\n*   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` `ACT`...-3’\n*   **Amino Acid Sequence:**\n    *   `ATG` = Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` = Phenylalanine\n    *   `CTC` = Leucine\n    *   `GCT` = Alanine\n    *   The resulting protein begins: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant and its Effect on the Protein**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TT**C** TA**C** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). The second codon also changes from `TTT` to `TTC`, but both code for Phenylalanine, making it a silent mutation.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** The critical change is a **missense mutation**. This substitutes one amino acid for another. While this might alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TT**C** T**AA** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**. It signals the cell's machinery to terminate protein synthesis.\n    *   **Effect:** Translation will stop after only two amino acids have been joined. The result is a severely truncated, two-amino-acid fragment (Met-Phe) instead of a full protein. This fragment will be completely non-functional. This is the most definitive way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TA**C** GCT GGT G**TC**...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This mutant contains two changes: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and further down, `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** These are two separate **missense mutations**. While having two amino acid changes is more likely to be disruptive than one, it is still less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT TA**C** GCT **A**CT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This mutant also contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `GGT` (Glycine) becomes `ACT` (Threonine).\n    *   **Effect:** Similar to Mutant 3, this produces a full-length protein with altered amino acids, but the outcome on its function is uncertain.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the potential effects, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. The other mutations (missense) only alter the amino acid sequence, which may or may not inactivate the protein. Therefore, the mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe python script successfully translated the DNA sequences of the intact gene and the four mutants into their corresponding amino acid sequences.\n\nThe analysis shows:\n*   **Intact Gene:** Produces a full-length protein starting with `MFLAG...`.\n*   **Mutant 1, 3, and 4:** These result in missense mutations (substituting one amino acid for another) or an in-frame deletion. These mutations create altered proteins that might still retain some or all of their function.\n*   **Mutant 2:** The mutation `CTC` -> `TAA` introduces a premature stop codon (`_STOP_`) at the third position. This is a nonsense mutation.\n\nA nonsense mutation that occurs this early in the gene sequence will cause protein synthesis to terminate, producing a severely truncated and non-functional protein fragment (only two amino acids long). This is the most definitive way to eliminate the gene's function and, consequently, the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nTo decide the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of each mutation's effect on the protein product is necessary. The goal is to find the mutation most likely to render the protein non-functional, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Intact Gene's Protein Sequence**\n\nFirst, we must establish the reading frame and the initial amino acid sequence of the original, functional protein. The genetic code is read in triplets of nucleotides (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene DNA:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` `ACT`...-3’\n*   **Translated Amino Acids:**\n    *   `ATG` = Methionine (Met) - Start\n    *   `TTT` = Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` = Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` = Alanine (Ala)\n*   **Intact Protein Start:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n**2. Analyze Each Mutant**\n\nNow, we will analyze each mutant to determine the type of mutation and its likely effect on the protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TT**C** TA**C** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Codon Changes:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). The second codon `TTT` also changes to `TTC`, but both code for Phenylalanine, making it a silent mutation.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** The critical change is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another (Leu -> Tyr).\n    *   **Effect:** This results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid change. This might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TT**C** T**AA** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Codon Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**, which signals the ribosome to terminate protein synthesis.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will halt after only two amino acids have been joined. The result is a severely truncated peptide (Met-Phe) that is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most definitive way to \"knock out\" a gene's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT T**A**C GCT GGT G**T**C...-3’\n    *   **Codon Changes:** This sequence contains two missense mutations: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** Multiple **missense mutations**.\n    *   **Effect:** The resulting protein has two amino acid substitutions. While this is more likely to disrupt function than a single missense mutation, it is still less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT T**A**C GCT **A**CT...-3’\n    *   **Codon Changes:** This sequence involves a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** A combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 nucleotides).\n    *   **Effect:** The protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another substituted (Leu -> Tyr). Because the deletion is \"in-frame,\" the rest of the protein sequence is translated correctly. This could disrupt function, but it is generally less severe than a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the potential outcomes, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon), ensuring that a functional, full-length protein cannot be made. The other mutations (missense and in-frame deletion) result in altered proteins that might retain partial or even full function. Therefore, the mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound produced by a specific gene. The most effective way to achieve this is to introduce a mutation that renders the protein encoded by this gene completely non-functional. This is often called a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Likely Effects**\nTo evaluate the mutants, we must understand the impact of different mutation types:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes a single nucleotide, resulting in a different amino acid. This may or may not inactivate the protein. Its effect is often unpredictable.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes a nucleotide but does not change the resulting amino acid. It has no effect on the protein sequence.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a nucleotide to create a premature \"stop\" codon (like TAA, TAG, or TGA). This halts protein synthesis, creating a truncated (shortened) protein that is almost always non-functional, especially if the mutation occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides in a number that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence from that point onward and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of nucleotides in a multiple of three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This can be disruptive but is generally less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nFirst, we must establish the reading frame of the intact gene by breaking the sequence into three-letter codons, starting with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` `ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine - Threonine...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TT**C** TA**C** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TT**C** T**AA** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe) that will be completely non-functional. This is the most definitive way to knock out the gene's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT **TAC** GCT GGT **GTC**...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine). These are two separate **missense mutations**. While more disruptive than one, it is still less certain to eliminate function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT **TAC** GCT **ACT**...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact sequence (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), we see two changes: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the `GGT` (Glycine) codon has been deleted. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The protein will be made but will be missing one amino acid and have another one changed. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four mutations, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and the most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a useless fragment of the protein is ever synthesized. This is the most reliable method among the choices to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
