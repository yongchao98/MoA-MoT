Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An **acetyl group** (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A **bromo group** (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to one another (1,3,5-substitution). This specific substitution pattern is a critical clue for determining the synthetic strategy.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe directing effect of each substituent in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial:\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH₂ (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option**\n\n**Option A: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene is converted to bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   Step ii: Nitration of bromobenzene yields mainly 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This does not establish the required 1,3-relationship for the final product.\n*   Step iii: A Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene would fail or give a negligible yield because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n*   **Conclusion:** This route is incorrect.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n*   Step i & ii: Benzene is converted to nitrobenzene and then reduced to aniline.\n*   Step iii: A Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂) to form a complex that strongly deactivates the ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** This route is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n*   Steps i through iv outline the conversion of benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a benzenediazonium salt, and finally back to benzene via deamination. This is a pointless loop that accomplishes nothing.\n*   **Conclusion:** This route is nonsensical and incorrect.\n\n**Option C: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\nThis sequence is complex and represents a sophisticated strategy to control the final positions of the substituents for a high yield.\n1.  **i) Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone:** This correctly installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at position 3.\n3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone:** At this stage, the ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The directing effects are in conflict. The less deactivating bromo group's directing effect will dominate, placing the nitro group primarily at the *para* position relative to itself (position 4), not the desired position 5. This is a crucial intermediate, not the final product.\n4.  **iv) Product from (iii) + Fe/HCl → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone:** The nitro group at position 4 is reduced to a strongly activating amino group (-NH₂).\n5.  **v) Product from (iv) + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone:** Now, the powerful activating amino group at C4 directs the new nitro group. It directs *ortho* to itself, to positions 3 and 5. Since position 3 is already occupied by bromine, the nitration occurs unambiguously at position 5. This step perfectly installs the final nitro group in the correct location.\n6.  **vi) Product from (v) + NaNO₂/HCl → Diazonium salt:** The amino group at position 4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺). This group was used as a temporary directing group.\n7.  **vii) Diazonium salt + H₃PO₂ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination). This final step yields the target molecule.\n\nThis sequence is a chemically sound and elegant example of using a temporary directing group to achieve a substitution pattern that would be low-yield or impossible to obtain directly. Each step is highly regioselective, fulfilling the \"high-yield\" requirement of the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must carefully analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step of the proposed syntheses.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   At position 1: an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   At position 3: a bromo group (-Br).\n*   At position 5: a nitro group (-NO2).\nThe key structural feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe outcome of each electrophilic aromatic substitution step is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option Step-by-Step**\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Steps i and ii correctly produce aniline from benzene.\n    *   Step iii is a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents acylation of the ring. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n    *   Steps i through iv (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination with H3PO2) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless and inefficient loop. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step i produces bromobenzene. Step ii (nitration) produces mainly *p*-bromonitrobenzene.\n    *   Step iii is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on *p*-bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, causing the Friedel-Crafts reaction to fail or give negligible yields. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This sequence is complex and requires a full step-by-step analysis. It represents a sophisticated strategy using a temporary directing group.\n    1.  **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Benzene is acylated to form **acetophenone**. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **ii) Br2/FeBr3:** The acetyl group directs bromination to the *meta* position, forming **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n    3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The less deactivating bromo group will direct substitution, leading to the formation of **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone** as the major product. This is not the final target, but it is a crucial intermediate.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of the intermediate is reduced to an amino group, yielding **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**.\n    5.  **v) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of the new intermediate. The ring now has a powerful activating *ortho, para*-directing amino group (-NH2). This group's effect dominates all others. It directs the new nitro group to its *ortho* positions (C3 and C5). Since C3 is blocked by bromine, nitration occurs exclusively at C5, forming **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone**. This step is highly regioselective.\n    6.  **vi) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    7.  **vii) H3PO2:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\n    This final step yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Although it is a long process, this sequence is chemically sound and uses established reactions to control the placement of each substituent, ultimately leading to the desired product. The other options contain steps that are chemically impossible or nonsensical.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent structure is a benzene ring.\n*   There are three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The key structural feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of reactions is critical and depends on how each substituent directs the next incoming group in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. (This group appears in intermediates via reduction of -NO2).\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\nThe options are complex, multi-step syntheses. The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), and deamination (`H3PO2`) suggests a sophisticated strategy involving a temporary directing group that is later removed.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Steps i & ii convert benzene to aniline.\n    *   Step iii is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivated complex and preventing acylation of the ring. This sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n    *   Steps i through iv convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop that accomplishes nothing. This sequence is illogical.\n\n*   **Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step i gives bromobenzene. Step ii gives mainly 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step iii is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, so this reaction fails or gives extremely low yield. This sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its full sequence, as it represents a classic strategy for complex substitutions.\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This correctly installs a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the bromine to the *meta* position. The 1,3-relationship is established.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone.** This is a crucial step. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The less deactivating -Br group's directing effect is dominant, placing the nitro group mainly at the *para* position relative to itself (C4). This product is an **intermediate**, not the final target.\n    4.  **iv) Intermediate + Fe/HCl → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone.** The nitro group at C4 is reduced to a strongly activating amino group (-NH2).\n    5.  **v) Intermediate + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone.** Now, the powerful activating amino group at C4 directs the new nitro group to its *ortho* position (C5), as C3 is already blocked. This step is highly regioselective.\n    6.  **vi) Intermediate + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt.** The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    7.  **vii) Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination). This yields the final target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSequence C describes a complete, chemically sound, and elegant synthesis. It uses a nitro group as a temporary directing group (which is later converted to an amino group and then removed) to control the regiochemistry and achieve the difficult 1,3,5-substitution pattern with high selectivity. The other options contain fatal chemical flaws.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAnswering this question requires a detailed step-by-step analysis of each proposed synthetic route, paying close attention to the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and the limitations of certain reactions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   It has a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   At position 1: Acetyl group (-COCH3), a deactivating *meta*-director.\n*   At position 3: Bromo group (-Br), a deactivating *ortho, para*-director.\n*   At position 5: Nitro group (-NO2), a strongly deactivating *meta*-director.\nThe key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each sequence based on established principles of organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n    *   Steps i through iv (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop that accomplishes nothing. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    *   Step i: Benzene is brominated to form bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n    *   Step ii: Bromobenzene is nitrated. This will produce a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, with the para isomer being the major product. The desired 1,3 relationship is not formed.\n    *   Step iii: This step attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    *   Step i: Benzene is nitrated to form nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step ii: Nitrobenzene is reduced to form aniline.\n    *   Step iii: This step attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) is a strong acid that reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) of aniline. This forms a complex (-NH3+AlCl3-) that is extremely deactivating, preventing the acylation reaction on the ring. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This sequence is complex but represents a valid and clever synthetic strategy for achieving a high-yield synthesis of a difficult substitution pattern.\n    *   **Step i:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step ii:** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The directing effects are conflicting. The less deactivating *o,p*-director (-Br) will have a stronger influence, directing the nitro group primarily to the 4-position (para to Br). So, the major product is **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone**. The desired 1,3,5-isomer is only a minor product at this stage.\n    *   **Step iv:** The major product from step iii, 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone, is treated with Fe/HCl. This reduces the nitro group to an amino group, forming **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**.\n    *   **Step v:** This intermediate is nitrated. The ring now has three substituents: -COCH3 (m-director), -Br (o,p-director), and -NH2 (a very strong o,p-director). The powerful amino group at position 4 will control the substitution, directing the new nitro group to its ortho positions (3 and 5). Position 3 is already occupied by bromine, so the nitration occurs unambiguously at position 5, forming **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone**. This is a highly regioselective step.\n    *   **Step vi:** The amino group at position 4 is converted into a diazonium salt with NaNO2/HCl.\n    *   **Step vii:** The diazonium salt is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom using H3PO2 (deamination). This removes the temporary directing group.\n\nThe final product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This sophisticated route uses a temporary directing group to overcome the initial unfavorable regiochemistry and achieve the target molecule in high yield. Since options B, C, and D are fundamentally flawed, option A is the only correct sequence.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\nThis is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of reactions is critical and depends on the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n\nA \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that each step should be highly regioselective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of unwanted isomers. The presence of reagents for reduction (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) strongly suggests a sophisticated strategy where an amino group is used as a temporary directing group and then removed.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii).\n    *   Step iii, a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline, will fail. The basic amino group (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents the acylation of the ring. This option is chemically unviable.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    *   The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop that accomplishes nothing. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   This sequence starts with bromination, followed by nitration, which yields primarily 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step iii attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this product. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, so this reaction will fail or give a negligible yield. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This sequence represents a logical, multi-step synthesis that uses a temporary directing group.\n    1.  **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Benzene is acylated to form **acetophenone**. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **ii) Br2/FeBr3:** Acetophenone is brominated. The acetyl group directs the bromine to the *meta* position, forming **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n    3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The *o,p*-directing effect of the halogen is stronger, leading to nitration at the position *ortho* to the bromine (C4), forming **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone** as the major product.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**. This introduces a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director.\n    5.  **v) HNO3/H2SO4:** The product from step iv is nitrated. The powerful amino group is the dominant director. It directs the new nitro group to its open *ortho* position (C5), as the other *ortho* position (C3) is blocked by bromine. This step is highly regioselective, forming **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone**.\n    6.  **vi) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    7.  **vii) H3PO2:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThis final step yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.

Evaluate Each Option**\nThe options are all seven steps long and include reagents for reduction (Fe/HCl) and Sandmeyer-type reactions (NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2). This suggests a complex synthesis is required, likely using a temporary directing group that is later removed to achieve the difficult 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). A Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot be performed on aniline (formed in step ii). The basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivated complex and preventing the reaction.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n    This sequence is nonsensical. Steps (i) through (iv) involve nitration, reduction, diazotization, and then deamination. This converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. It is a pointless loop.\n\n*   **Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). After bromination and nitration (steps i and ii), the major product is 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, so a Friedel-Crafts acylation will not proceed.\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This sequence represents a sophisticated and chemically sound strategy for a high-yield synthesis.\n    1.  **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Benzene is acylated to form **acetophenone**. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **ii) Br2/FeBr3:** Acetophenone is brominated. The acetyl group directs the bromine to the *meta* position, forming **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n    3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The directing effects are conflicting. However, the positions *ortho* and *para* to the bromine (positions 4 and 6) are least deactivated, so the major product formed is **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone**.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of the intermediate is reduced to an amino group, forming **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**. The amino group is a powerful *ortho, para*-director.\n    5.  **v) HNO3/H2SO4:** The molecule is nitrated again. The powerful activating amino group at C4 directs the new nitro group to its *ortho* position, C5 (position C3 is blocked by bromine). This step is highly regioselective, forming **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone**.\n    6.  **vi) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    7.  **vii) H3PO2:** The diazonium salt is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\n    This final step removes the temporary amino directing group, leaving the desired final product: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This complex pathway is the only one that is chemically viable and designed to overcome the regiochemical challenges to provide a high yield.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must carefully analyze the directing effects of the substituents and the conditions of each reaction step.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Parent structure:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director. This group is formed by the reduction of a nitro group (e.g., with Fe/HCl).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe question asks for a **high-yield** synthesis. This is a critical clue. A simple, one-by-one addition of substituents might lead to mixtures of isomers if the directing effects of the groups are in conflict, resulting in a low yield of the desired product. The presence of reagents for reduction (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) strongly suggests that a more sophisticated strategy is required, likely involving the use of a temporary directing group that is later removed.\n\nLet's analyze each option with this in mind:\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts by forming aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring. This pathway is not viable.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts by forming bromobenzene, then nitrating it to get mainly 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. This reaction fails or gives extremely low yields. This pathway is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...`\n    The first four steps of this sequence convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop and cannot be the correct synthetic route.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    This sequence represents a valid, albeit complex, high-yield synthesis using a temporary directing group. Let's trace the steps:\n    1.  **i) Benzene → Acetophenone:** Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs bromination to the *meta* position.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone:** This is a crucial step. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The directing effects are conflicting. The major product formed is the 4-nitro isomer, not the desired 5-nitro isomer. However, this nitro group will now be used as a temporary directing group.\n    4.  **iv) Reduction → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone:** The nitro group at position 4 is reduced to a powerful *ortho, para*-directing amino group (-NH2).\n    5.  **v) Nitration → 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone:** Now, the ring has three groups. The most powerful activating group is the amino group at C4. It strongly directs the incoming nitro group to its *ortho* positions (C3 and C5). Since C3 is already occupied by bromine, the nitration occurs with high selectivity at C5.\n    6.  **vi) Diazotization:** The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    7.  **vii) Deamination:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom using H3PO2.\n\nThis sequence successfully removes the temporary directing group, leaving the final product, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, in high yield due to the regiocontrolled nitration in step (v). This is the only chemically sound, high-yield pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution).\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -COCH₃: Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   -Br: Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -NO₂: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **The Challenge:** The question asks for a **high-yield** synthesis. A simple, one-by-one addition of substituents is difficult because the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group will conflict with the *meta*-directing acetyl and nitro groups, leading to a mixture of products and low yield of the desired isomer. A more sophisticated strategy is likely required.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Pathways\n\nLet's analyze the chemical viability of the sequences presented in the options. The labels (A, B, C, D) are inconsistent across the candidate answers, so we will analyze the reaction sequences themselves.\n\n**Pathway 1: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**\n*   `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The acetyl group directs the bromine to the *meta* position. This step is regioselective.\n    3.  **Nitration:** This is the critical step. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). Their directing effects are in **conflict**. The -COCH₃ directs to C5, while the -Br directs to C2, C4, and C6. This will inevitably lead to a mixture of isomers, making it a **low-yield** pathway for the desired product. Therefore, this simple sequence is not the correct answer.\n\n**Pathway 2: Pathways that Fail Fundamentally**\n*   **Starting with Nitration → Reduction → Acylation:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...` This pathway fails because Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) does not work on aniline (the product of step ii). The Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n*   **Starting with Bromination → Nitration → Acylation:** `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...` This pathway fails because Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) does not work on the strongly deactivated 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene ring (the product of step ii).\n*   **Pointless Loop:** Any sequence that involves `Nitration → Reduction → Diazotization → Deamination` (with H₃PO₂) on benzene simply returns to benzene and is nonsensical.\n\n**Pathway 3: A Sophisticated, High-Yield Synthesis (Analyzed by Agent 10)**\nThis pathway uses a temporary directing group that is removed in the final step. Let's trace the sequence corresponding to option C in several of the provided answers:\n*   `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **i) Benzene → Acetophenone.**\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.**\n    3.  **iii) Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone.** As established in Pathway 1, this step has conflicting directors. The major product is actually **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone**, where the nitro group adds *para* to the bromine.\n    4.  **iv) Reduction:** The nitro group at C4 is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂), yielding **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**.\n    5.  **v) Second Nitration:** The ring now has a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director (-NH₂ at C4), an *o,p*-director (-Br at C3), and a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1). The amino group's effect is dominant. It strongly directs the new nitro group to its *ortho* position, C5. The other *ortho* position (C3) is blocked. This step is highly regioselective, forming **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone**.\n    6.  **vi) Diazotization:** The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    7.  **vii) Deamination:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom using H₃PO₂.\n\nThis sequence removes the temporary amino group, leaving the final desired product: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Each step is designed to be highly regioselective, making this a valid **high-yield** synthesis.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe simple, direct 3-step synthesis (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is not a high-yield route due to conflicting directing effects in the final step. The other simple routes fail due to fundamental limitations of the Friedel-Crafts reaction. The only chemically sound pathway that ensures a high yield is the complex, multi-step synthesis that uses a temporary directing group which is later removed. This sophisticated route corresponds to the sequence of reactions listed in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must carefully analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\nThe key structural feature is that all three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (a 1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order in which the groups are added is critical, as existing groups direct the position of new ones.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option Step-by-Step**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails on aniline because the basic amino group (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents acylation of the ring. This option is chemically unviable.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence starts with bromination to form bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration (step ii) would yield mainly 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, which does not have the required 1,3-relationship. Furthermore, the Friedel-Crafts acylation in step (iii) would fail on the strongly deactivated ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...`\n    *   The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene back into benzene. This is a pointless loop and cannot be the correct synthetic route.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    *   This sequence provides a chemically sound pathway. There are two ways to interpret its validity:\n\n    *   **Interpretation 1 (Simple Synthesis):** The first three steps are sufficient to form the product.\n        1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This correctly installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n        2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs bromination to the *meta* position, correctly establishing the 1,3-relationship.\n        3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. The most favorable position for substitution is C5, which is *meta* to both deactivating groups, leading to the desired product as the major isomer. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) can be seen as superfluous distractors.\n\n    *   **Interpretation 2 (Complex, High-Yield Synthesis):** The entire 7-step sequence describes a sophisticated synthesis that uses a temporary directing group to ensure high yield, a common strategy for complex substitutions. While the analysis is more involved, it confirms the validity of the entire sequence as written, using every reagent to achieve the final product with high purity.\n\nSince both a simple interpretation of the core synthesis and a complex interpretation of the full sequence point to Option D as the only chemically viable route, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo decide the final answer, I will meticulously analyze each proposed reaction sequence based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry, specifically electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and the directing effects of substituents.\n\n**1.

Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of reactions is critical, as existing groups on the ring direct the position of new groups.\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-NH₂ (amino):** Strongly activating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n\nThe presence of reagents for diazotization and deamination (`Fe/HCl`, `NaNO₂/HCl`, `H₃PO₂`) strongly suggests a sophisticated synthesis where an amino group is used as a temporary directing group and then removed.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option Step-by-Step**\n\n*   **Option A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    1.  **i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.** The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n    2.  **ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene** (major product). This step creates a 1,4-pattern, which is incorrect for the desired 1,3,5-pattern.\n    3.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction fails or gives extremely low yields on strongly deactivated rings, such as those containing a nitro group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically unviable.\n\n*   **Option C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    1.  **i) - iv):** This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and finally deamination. This series of reactions converts benzene back into benzene (`C₆H₆ → C₆H₅NO₂ → C₆H₅NH₂ → C₆H₅N₂⁺ → C₆H₆`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence contains a pointless and inefficient loop, making it an incorrect pathway.\n\n*   **Option D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    1.  **i) & ii):** Benzene is converted to aniline (`C₆H₆ → C₆H₅NO₂ → C₆H₅NH₂`).\n    2.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) on Aniline:** This reaction fails. The basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts irreversibly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents acylation of the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically unviable.\n\n*   **Option B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence is complex but represents a valid and clever synthetic strategy.\n    1.  **i) Benzene → Acetophenone.** The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is a good start.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at position 3.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The directing effects are conflicting. The less deactivating -Br group will control the position, directing the nitro group primarily to its *para* position (C4). The major product is **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone**. This is *not* the final product, but a key intermediate.\n    4.  **iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl).** The nitro group at C4 is reduced to an amino group, yielding **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**.\n    5.  **v) Nitration.** The ring now has a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director (-NH₂) at C4. This group completely controls the substitution, directing the new nitro group to its other *ortho* position, C5 (since C3 is blocked). This step unambiguously forms **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone**.\n    6.  **vi) Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl).** The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    7.  **vii) Deamination (H₃PO₂).** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom.\n\n    This final step removes the temporary directing group from C4, yielding the desired final product: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nOptions A, C, and D contain chemically flawed steps. Option B describes a complete, logical, and high-yield synthesis that cleverly uses a temporary directing group to achieve the difficult 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of each proposed pathway is required. The decision must be based on the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution, including the directing effects of substituents and the reactivity of the aromatic ring.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An **acetyl group** (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A **bromo group** (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe key structural feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all substituents are *meta* to one another.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of substitution is critical and is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring:\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-NH₂ (amino):** Strongly activating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option**\n\n**Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n*   Steps i) and ii) correctly synthesize aniline from benzene.\n*   Step iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents acylation of the ring. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option B: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n*   Step i) forms bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   Step ii) involves the nitration of bromobenzene, which would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product). This does not create the required 1,3 relationship.\n*   Step iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. This reaction does not proceed under normal conditions. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n*   Steps i) through iv) describe the nitration of benzene, reduction to aniline, diazotization, and finally deamination to convert the molecule back to benzene. This is a pointless loop that accomplishes nothing. Therefore, this sequence is illogical.\n\n**Option D: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\nThis sequence represents a sophisticated, multi-step synthesis that uses a temporary directing group to achieve the desired substitution pattern with high regioselectivity.\n\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Acetophenone:** A Friedel-Crafts acylation correctly installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director.\n*   **Step ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly guides the bromination to position 3.\n*   **Step iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone:** This is a nitration step. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The directing effects are conflicting, but the major product formed is the 4-nitro isomer, which serves as the key intermediate for the subsequent steps.\n*   **Step iv) Reduction:** The nitro group at position 4 is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂) using Fe/HCl, forming 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone.\n*   **Step v) Nitration:** The ring now contains a powerful activating *ortho, para*-directing amino group. This group controls the substitution, directing the new nitro group to its open *ortho* position (position 5), yielding 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone with high selectivity.\n*   **Step vi) Diazotization:** The amino group at position 4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺) with NaNO₂/HCl.\n*   **Step vii) Deamination:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom using H₃PO₂, yielding the final target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWhile complex, the reaction sequence outlined in **Option D** is the only chemically sound pathway among the choices that leads to the high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. It cleverly uses a nitro group as a precursor to a temporary amino directing group, which ensures the final nitro group is installed in the correct position, before being removed. Options A, B, and C contain fundamental flaws that make them unviable.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1.

Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\nThe question asks for a **high-yield** synthesis. This often requires avoiding steps where directing groups conflict, or using more advanced strategies to control regiochemistry. The presence of reagents like `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, and `H3PO2` strongly suggests a strategy involving the formation and subsequent removal of an amino group (a Sandmeyer-type deamination).\n\nLet's analyze the options based on this understanding.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...`\n    The first four steps convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop and cannot be the correct synthetic route.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   Step i: Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    *   Step ii: Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product, since -Br is an o,p-director). This does not establish the required 1,3-relationship.\n    *   Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This reaction fails or gives extremely low yield because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring. This route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    This sequence represents a sophisticated, multi-step synthesis that uses a temporary directing group. Let's trace the steps:\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** (Introduces a meta-director).\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** (The acetyl group directs the bromine to the meta position).\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone.** (This is the crucial step where a simple synthesis would fail to be high-yield. The -Br is an o,p-director and less deactivating than -COCH3, so it directs the nitration primarily to its para position, C4).\n    4.  **iv) Product from (iii) + Fe/HCl → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone.** (The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, which is a powerful activating o,p-director).\n    5.  **v) Product from (iv) + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone.** (The powerful amino group at C4 directs the new nitro group to its ortho position, C5. The other ortho position, C3, is blocked by bromine. This step proceeds with high regioselectivity).\n    6.  **vi) Product from (v) + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt.** (The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt, -N₂⁺).\n    7.  **vii) Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** (The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom).\n\nThis complex sequence is chemically sound and cleverly uses a temporary group (which starts as -NO2 and becomes -NH₂) to control the placement of the final nitro group, before being removed. This is a classic strategy for achieving a high yield of a substitution pattern that is otherwise difficult to obtain.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, B, and D contain fundamentally flawed steps. Option C describes a long but chemically valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a step-by-step analysis of each proposed route is necessary, paying close attention to the directing effects of the substituents and the limitations of certain reactions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Acetyl group (-COCH3)\n    *   Position 3: Bromo group (-Br)\n    *   Position 5: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of substitution is critical. The directing effects of the groups involved are:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThe presence of reagents for reduction (Fe/HCl) and deamination (NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests that a simple, one-after-the-other substitution is not the intended high-yield path. Instead, a more sophisticated strategy using a temporary directing group that is later removed is likely required.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    This sequence begins by converting benzene to nitrobenzene (i), then to aniline (ii), then to a diazonium salt (iii), and finally back to benzene (iv). This four-step loop is nonsensical and inefficient.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    This sequence starts by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails on aniline because the basic amino group (-NH2) reacts irreversibly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring.\n\n*   **Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    This sequence starts by forming bromobenzene (i), then nitrating it (ii) to give mainly 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. This reaction does not proceed under standard conditions.\n\n*   **Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This sequence represents a valid, multi-step strategy that uses a temporary directing group to achieve the desired substitution pattern in high yield.\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **ii) Bromination:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). This leads to a mixture of products, but the major isomer formed is 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone. This will serve as the key intermediate.\n    4.  **iv) Reduction:** The nitro group at position 4 is reduced with Fe/HCl to an amino group (-NH2), forming 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone. The amino group is a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director.\n    5.  **v) Nitration:** The powerful amino group at C4 now controls the substitution. It directs the new nitro group to its *ortho* position, C5 (the other ortho position, C3, is blocked by bromine). This step is highly regioselective, yielding 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone.\n    6.  **vi) Diazotization:** The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺) with NaNO2/HCl.\n    7.  **vii) Deamination:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom using H3PO2.\n\nThis final step removes the temporary directing group, leaving the desired product, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, in high yield. While complex, this is the only chemically sound pathway among the choices that correctly navigates the conflicting directing effects to produce the target molecule with high selectivity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe python script analyzed four potential reaction sequences for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. It evaluated each option based on established principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution, including substituent directing effects and reaction limitations.\n\nThe analysis concluded the following:\n*   **Options A, B, and D** are not viable for a high-yield synthesis. They contain steps that would either fail (e.g., Friedel-Crafts reactions on strongly deactivated rings or on aniline) or result in a low-yield mixture of isomers due to conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Option C** describes a complex but chemically sound multi-step synthesis. This route cleverly uses a nitro group (which is later reduced to an amino group) as a temporary directing group to control the regiochemistry of subsequent substitutions. The final steps involve removing this temporary group via diazotization and deamination to yield the desired 1,3,5-substituted product. This is a valid and sophisticated strategy for achieving a high yield of a product with a challenging substitution pattern.\n\nTherefore, Option C is the only sequence that describes a correct, high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution principles is required.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Substituents:** It has an acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of reactions is critical because existing groups on the ring direct the position of new substituents.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director. This group is formed by the reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl) and can be removed via diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and deamination (H3PO2). The presence of these reagents in the options strongly suggests a complex synthesis involving a temporary directing group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\nA simple, one-by-one addition of the three groups is problematic. For instance, if we perform acylation, then bromination, we get 3-bromoacetophenone. The final nitration step would have conflicting directors (-COCH3 is *meta*, -Br is *ortho, para*), leading to a mixture of products and thus a low yield. A high-yield synthesis requires a more sophisticated strategy.\n\nLet's analyze the most chemically sound, multi-step pathway presented among the candidate answers, which is a sophisticated route designed to control the position of each substituent precisely. This pathway corresponds to the logic presented for option C in several of the more detailed analyses (e.g., Answer 10).\n\n**The Correct High-Yield Synthetic Pathway:**\n\n*   **Step i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This introduces the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director.\n    *   *Product: Acetophenone*\n\n*   **Step ii) Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position.\n    *   *Product: 3-Bromoacetophenone*\n\n*   **Step iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The less deactivating bromo group will control the position, directing the nitro group to the position *para* to itself (position 4).\n    *   *Product: 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone*\n\n*   **Step iv) Fe/HCl (Reduction):** The nitro group at position 4 is reduced to a temporary amino group (-NH2), which is a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   *Product: 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone*\n\n*   **Step v) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** The powerful amino group now controls the substitution. It directs the new nitro group to its *ortho* position (C5), as the other *ortho* position (C3) is already blocked by bromine. This step is highly selective.\n    *   *Product: 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone*\n\n*   **Step vi) NaNO2/HCl (Diazotization):** The temporary amino group at position 4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n\n*   **Step vii) H3PO2 (Deamination):** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom.\n\nThis sequence successfully removes the temporary directing group, leaving the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This complex but logical pathway is designed to be high-yield by using a temporary group to ensure the correct placement of all substituents. This detailed sequence aligns with the reagents listed in option C, assuming a likely mislabeling in the provided prompt text that was correctly interpreted by some of the more advanced analyses. The other options contain fundamental chemical flaws, such as attempting Friedel-Crafts reactions on strongly deactivated rings or containing nonsensical reaction loops.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of each proposed pathway is required, paying close attention to the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Substituents:** An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to one another.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director. This is relevant as `Fe/HCl` is a reagent used to create it from a nitro group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe prompt requires a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This implies that steps with conflicting directing effects, which would produce a mixture of isomers, should be avoided. The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), and deamination (`H3PO2`) strongly suggests that a complex synthesis using a temporary directing group is the intended high-yield route.\n\nLet's analyze the most plausible option based on this strategy.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n\nThis sequence represents a sophisticated and chemically sound strategy to achieve the difficult 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Step i: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.**\n    This Friedel-Crafts acylation correctly installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director.\n\n*   **Step ii: Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.**\n    The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly positions the incoming bromine at C3.\n\n*   **Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone.**\n    At this stage, the ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). Their effects conflict. The major product formed is the 4-nitro isomer, which will serve as the necessary intermediate for the subsequent steps.\n\n*   **Step iv: Product from (iii) + Fe/HCl → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone.**\n    The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2). This group is a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director and will control the next substitution.\n\n*   **Step v: Product from (iv) + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone.**\n    This is the crucial step for regioselectivity. The powerful amino group at C4 directs the incoming nitro group to its *ortho* positions (C3 and C5). Since C3 is already occupied by bromine, the nitration occurs unambiguously at C5.\n\n*   **Step vi: Product from (v) + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt.**\n    The temporary amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n\n*   **Step vii: Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\n    The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination). This final step removes the temporary directing group, leaving the desired 1,3,5-substituted product.\n\n**Conclusion on Other Options:**\n*   **Options A and B:** These routes fail because they involve Friedel-Crafts reactions on strongly deactivated rings (due to the presence of a nitro group), which are not feasible.\n*   **Option C:** This sequence begins with a series of reactions (i-iv) that convert benzene to nitrobenzene and then back to benzene, which is a nonsensical and unproductive loop.\n\nTherefore, Option D is the only sequence that describes a chemically valid, high-yield synthesis for the target molecule by using an amino group as a temporary, powerful directing group to ensure the correct placement of all substituents before being removed.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "To determine the correct answer, a careful step-by-step analysis of the proposed chemical transformations is required. The goal is to find a high-yield synthesis for 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Name**: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure**: A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Challenge**: The molecule has a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three substituents are *meta* to each other. A high-yield synthesis for such a pattern is non-trivial because it involves navigating the different directing effects of the substituents.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\n\nThe outcome of each electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) step depends on the directing effects of the groups already on the ring:\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl)**: Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo)**: Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH₂ (amino)**: Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director. This group is relevant as it can be formed by reducing a nitro group (e.g., with Fe/HCl) and later removed via diazotization and deamination (e.g., with NaNO₂/HCl then H₃PO₂). The presence of these reagents in the options is a strong hint that this strategy is being used.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Potential Pathways\n\nLet's analyze the only chemically sound and sophisticated pathway that is designed for a high yield. This pathway is described consistently across the most thorough candidate answers, although it is assigned different letters (A, B, C, or D). The majority of the answers label this correct sequence as **C**.\n\n**The Correct Pathway (Labeled as C in most answers):**\n`i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`\n\n1.  **Step i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n2.  **Step ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. The 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups is now established.\n3.  **Step iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (First Nitration):** The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). Their directing effects are in conflict. The less deactivating bromo group's effect is dominant, directing the nitro group primarily to the position *para* to itself (C4). The major product is **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone**. This is not the final product but a crucial intermediate.\n4.  **Step iv) Fe/HCl (Reduction):** The nitro group at C4 is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂), forming **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**. This introduces a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director.\n5.  **Step v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Second Nitration):** This is the key regioselective step. The powerful activating amino group at C4 now controls the substitution. It directs the new nitro group to its open *ortho* position (C5), as the other *ortho* position (C3) is already blocked by bromine. This step forms **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone** with high selectivity.\n6.  **Step vi) NaNO₂/HCl (Diazotization):** The amino group at C4, having served its purpose as a temporary directing group, is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n7.  **Step vii) H₃PO₂ (Deamination):** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom.\n\nThis final step yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This complex but logical pathway is the only one presented that is chemically sound and designed to be high-yield by using a temporary group to ensure the correct placement of all substituents.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of Other Pathways\n\n*   Any sequence attempting a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (formed from nitration and reduction) will fail because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst.\n*   Any sequence attempting a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring already containing a nitro group will fail or give negligible yield due to the strong deactivation of the ring.\n*   Any sequence that contains a loop of nitration -> reduction -> diazotization -> deamination on benzene itself is nonsensical as it just returns the starting material.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the seven-step sequence involving a temporary directing group is the only correct answer. The majority of the provided candidate answers identify this sequence and label it as C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

The directing effects are in conflict. The less deactivating bromo group's directing effect will dominate, placing the nitro group primarily at the *para* position relative to itself (position 4), not the desired position 5. This is a crucial intermediate, not the final product.\n4.  **iv) Product from (iii) + Fe/HCl → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone:** The nitro group at position 4 is reduced to a strongly activating amino group (-NH₂).\n5.  **v) Product from (iv) + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone:** Now, the powerful activating amino group at C4 directs the new nitro group. It directs *ortho* to itself, to positions 3 and 5. Since position 3 is already occupied by bromine, the nitration occurs unambiguously at position 5. This step perfectly installs the final nitro group in the correct location.\n6.  **vi) Product from (v) + NaNO₂/HCl → Diazonium salt:** The amino group at position 4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺). This group was used as a temporary directing group.\n7.  **vii) Diazonium salt + H₃PO₂ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination). This final step yields the target molecule.\n\nThis sequence is a chemically sound and elegant example of using a temporary directing group to achieve a substitution pattern that would be low-yield or impossible to obtain directly. Each step is highly regioselective, fulfilling the \"high-yield\" requirement of the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must carefully analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step of the proposed syntheses.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   At position 1: an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   At position 3: a bromo group (-Br).\n*   At position 5: a nitro group (-NO2).\nThe key structural feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe outcome of each electrophilic aromatic substitution step is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option Step-by-Step**\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Steps i and ii correctly produce aniline from benzene.\n    *   Step iii is a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents acylation of the ring. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n    *   Steps i through iv (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination with H3PO2) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless and inefficient loop. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step i produces bromobenzene. Step ii (nitration) produces mainly *p*-bromonitrobenzene.\n    *   Step iii is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on *p*-bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, causing the Friedel-Crafts reaction to fail or give negligible yields. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This sequence is complex and requires a full step-by-step analysis. It represents a sophisticated strategy using a temporary directing group.\n    1.  **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Benzene is acylated to form **acetophenone**. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **ii) Br2/FeBr3:** The acetyl group directs bromination to the *meta* position, forming **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n    3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The less deactivating bromo group will direct substitution, leading to the formation of **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone** as the major product. This is not the final target, but it is a crucial intermediate.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of the intermediate is reduced to an amino group, yielding **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**.\n    5.  **v) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of the new intermediate. The ring now has a powerful activating *ortho, para*-directing amino group (-NH2). This group's effect dominates all others. It directs the new nitro group to its *ortho* positions (C3 and C5). Since C3 is blocked by bromine, nitration occurs exclusively at C5, forming **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone**. This step is highly regioselective.\n    6.  **vi) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    7.  **vii) H3PO2:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\n    This final step yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Although it is a long process, this sequence is chemically sound and uses established reactions to control the placement of each substituent, ultimately leading to the desired product. The other options contain steps that are chemically impossible or nonsensical.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent structure is a benzene ring.\n*   There are three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The key structural feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of reactions is critical and depends on how each substituent directs the next incoming group in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. (This group appears in intermediates via reduction of -NO2).\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\nThe options are complex, multi-step syntheses. The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), and deamination (`H3PO2`) suggests a sophisticated strategy involving a temporary directing group that is later removed.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Steps i & ii convert benzene to aniline.\n    *   Step iii is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivated complex and preventing acylation of the ring. This sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n    *   Steps i through iv convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop that accomplishes nothing. This sequence is illogical.\n\n*   **Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step i gives bromobenzene. Step ii gives mainly 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step iii is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, so this reaction fails or gives extremely low yield. This sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its full sequence, as it represents a classic strategy for complex substitutions.\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This correctly installs a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the bromine to the *meta* position. The 1,3-relationship is established.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone.** This is a crucial step. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The less deactivating -Br group's directing effect is dominant, placing the nitro group mainly at the *para* position relative to itself (C4). This product is an **intermediate**, not the final target.\n    4.  **iv) Intermediate + Fe/HCl → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone.** The nitro group at C4 is reduced to a strongly activating amino group (-NH2).\n    5.  **v) Intermediate + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone.** Now, the powerful activating amino group at C4 directs the new nitro group to its *ortho* position (C5), as C3 is already blocked. This step is highly regioselective.\n    6.  **vi) Intermediate + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt.** The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    7.  **vii) Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination). This yields the final target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSequence C describes a complete, chemically sound, and elegant synthesis. It uses a nitro group as a temporary directing group (which is later converted to an amino group and then removed) to control the regiochemistry and achieve the difficult 1,3,5-substitution pattern with high selectivity. The other options contain fatal chemical flaws.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAnswering this question requires a detailed step-by-step analysis of each proposed synthetic route, paying close attention to the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and the limitations of certain reactions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   It has a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   At position 1: Acetyl group (-COCH3), a deactivating *meta*-director.\n*   At position 3: Bromo group (-Br), a deactivating *ortho, para*-director.\n*   At position 5: Nitro group (-NO2), a strongly deactivating *meta*-director.\nThe key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each sequence based on established principles of organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n    *   Steps i through iv (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop that accomplishes nothing. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    *   Step i: Benzene is brominated to form bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n    *   Step ii: Bromobenzene is nitrated. This will produce a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, with the para isomer being the major product. The desired 1,3 relationship is not formed.\n    *   Step iii: This step attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    *   Step i: Benzene is nitrated to form nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step ii: Nitrobenzene is reduced to form aniline.\n    *   Step iii: This step attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) is a strong acid that reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) of aniline. This forms a complex (-NH3+AlCl3-) that is extremely deactivating, preventing the acylation reaction on the ring. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This sequence is complex but represents a valid and clever synthetic strategy for achieving a high-yield synthesis of a difficult substitution pattern.\n    *   **Step i:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step ii:** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The directing effects are conflicting. The less deactivating *o,p*-director (-Br) will have a stronger influence, directing the nitro group primarily to the 4-position (para to Br). So, the major product is **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone**. The desired 1,3,5-isomer is only a minor product at this stage.\n    *   **Step iv:** The major product from step iii, 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone, is treated with Fe/HCl. This reduces the nitro group to an amino group, forming **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**.\n    *   **Step v:** This intermediate is nitrated. The ring now has three substituents: -COCH3 (m-director), -Br (o,p-director), and -NH2 (a very strong o,p-director). The powerful amino group at position 4 will control the substitution, directing the new nitro group to its ortho positions (3 and 5). Position 3 is already occupied by bromine, so the nitration occurs unambiguously at position 5, forming **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone**. This is a highly regioselective step.\n    *   **Step vi:** The amino group at position 4 is converted into a diazonium salt with NaNO2/HCl.\n    *   **Step vii:** The diazonium salt is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom using H3PO2 (deamination). This removes the temporary directing group.\n\nThe final product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This sophisticated route uses a temporary directing group to overcome the initial unfavorable regiochemistry and achieve the target molecule in high yield.

The presence of reagents for reduction (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) strongly suggests a sophisticated strategy where an amino group is used as a temporary directing group and then removed.\n\n**3.

The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The *o,p*-directing effect of the halogen is stronger, leading to nitration at the position *ortho* to the bromine (C4), forming **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone** as the major product.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**.

This group is formed by the reduction of a nitro group (e.g., with Fe/HCl).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe question asks for a **high-yield** synthesis. This is a critical clue. A simple, one-by-one addition of substituents might lead to mixtures of isomers if the directing effects of the groups are in conflict, resulting in a low yield of the desired product. The presence of reagents for reduction (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) strongly suggests that a more sophisticated strategy is required, likely involving the use of a temporary directing group that is later removed.\n\nLet's analyze each option with this in mind:\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts by forming aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring. This pathway is not viable.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts by forming bromobenzene, then nitrating it to get mainly 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. This reaction fails or gives extremely low yields. This pathway is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...`\n    The first four steps of this sequence convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop and cannot be the correct synthetic route.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    This sequence represents a valid, albeit complex, high-yield synthesis using a temporary directing group. Let's trace the steps:\n    1.  **i) Benzene → Acetophenone:** Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs bromination to the *meta* position.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone:** This is a crucial step. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The directing effects are conflicting. The major product formed is the 4-nitro isomer, not the desired 5-nitro isomer. However, this nitro group will now be used as a temporary directing group.\n    4.  **iv) Reduction → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone:** The nitro group at position 4 is reduced to a powerful *ortho, para*-directing amino group (-NH2).\n    5.  **v) Nitration → 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone:** Now, the ring has three groups. The most powerful activating group is the amino group at C4. It strongly directs the incoming nitro group to its *ortho* positions (C3 and C5). Since C3 is already occupied by bromine, the nitration occurs with high selectivity at C5.\n    6.  **vi) Diazotization:** The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    7.  **vii) Deamination:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom using H3PO2.\n\nThis sequence successfully removes the temporary directing group, leaving the final product, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, in high yield due to the regiocontrolled nitration in step (v). This is the only chemically sound, high-yield pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution).\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -COCH₃: Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   -Br: Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -NO₂: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **The Challenge:** The question asks for a **high-yield** synthesis. A simple, one-by-one addition of substituents is difficult because the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group will conflict with the *meta*-directing acetyl and nitro groups, leading to a mixture of products and low yield of the desired isomer. A more sophisticated strategy is likely required.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Pathways\n\nLet's analyze the chemical viability of the sequences presented in the options. The labels (A, B, C, D) are inconsistent across the candidate answers, so we will analyze the reaction sequences themselves.\n\n**Pathway 1: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**\n*   `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The acetyl group directs the bromine to the *meta* position. This step is regioselective.\n    3.  **Nitration:** This is the critical step. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). Their directing effects are in **conflict**. The -COCH₃ directs to C5, while the -Br directs to C2, C4, and C6. This will inevitably lead to a mixture of isomers, making it a **low-yield** pathway for the desired product. Therefore, this simple sequence is not the correct answer.\n\n**Pathway 2: Pathways that Fail Fundamentally**\n*   **Starting with Nitration → Reduction → Acylation:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...` This pathway fails because Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) does not work on aniline (the product of step ii). The Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n*   **Starting with Bromination → Nitration → Acylation:** `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...` This pathway fails because Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) does not work on the strongly deactivated 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene ring (the product of step ii).\n*   **Pointless Loop:** Any sequence that involves `Nitration → Reduction → Diazotization → Deamination` (with H₃PO₂) on benzene simply returns to benzene and is nonsensical.\n\n**Pathway 3: A Sophisticated, High-Yield Synthesis (Analyzed by Agent 10)**\nThis pathway uses a temporary directing group that is removed in the final step. Let's trace the sequence corresponding to option C in several of the provided answers:\n*   `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **i) Benzene → Acetophenone.**\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.**\n    3.  **iii) Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone.** As established in Pathway 1, this step has conflicting directors. The major product is actually **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone**, where the nitro group adds *para* to the bromine.\n    4.  **iv) Reduction:** The nitro group at C4 is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂), yielding **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**.\n    5.  **v) Second Nitration:** The ring now has a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director (-NH₂ at C4), an *o,p*-director (-Br at C3), and a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1). The amino group's effect is dominant. It strongly directs the new nitro group to its *ortho* position, C5. The other *ortho* position (C3) is blocked. This step is highly regioselective, forming **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone**.\n    6.  **vi) Diazotization:** The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    7.  **vii) Deamination:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom using H₃PO₂.\n\nThis sequence removes the temporary amino group, leaving the final desired product: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Each step is designed to be highly regioselective, making this a valid **high-yield** synthesis.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe simple, direct 3-step synthesis (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is not a high-yield route due to conflicting directing effects in the final step. The other simple routes fail due to fundamental limitations of the Friedel-Crafts reaction. The only chemically sound pathway that ensures a high yield is the complex, multi-step synthesis that uses a temporary directing group which is later removed. This sophisticated route corresponds to the sequence of reactions listed in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must carefully analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\nThe key structural feature is that all three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (a 1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order in which the groups are added is critical, as existing groups direct the position of new ones.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option Step-by-Step**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails on aniline because the basic amino group (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents acylation of the ring. This option is chemically unviable.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence starts with bromination to form bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration (step ii) would yield mainly 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, which does not have the required 1,3-relationship. Furthermore, the Friedel-Crafts acylation in step (iii) would fail on the strongly deactivated ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...`\n    *   The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene back into benzene. This is a pointless loop and cannot be the correct synthetic route.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    *   This sequence provides a chemically sound pathway. There are two ways to interpret its validity:\n\n    *   **Interpretation 1 (Simple Synthesis):** The first three steps are sufficient to form the product.\n        1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This correctly installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n        2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs bromination to the *meta* position, correctly establishing the 1,3-relationship.\n        3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. The most favorable position for substitution is C5, which is *meta* to both deactivating groups, leading to the desired product as the major isomer. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) can be seen as superfluous distractors.\n\n    *   **Interpretation 2 (Complex, High-Yield Synthesis):** The entire 7-step sequence describes a sophisticated synthesis that uses a temporary directing group to ensure high yield, a common strategy for complex substitutions. While the analysis is more involved, it confirms the validity of the entire sequence as written, using every reagent to achieve the final product with high purity.\n\nSince both a simple interpretation of the core synthesis and a complex interpretation of the full sequence point to Option D as the only chemically viable route, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo decide the final answer, I will meticulously analyze each proposed reaction sequence based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry, specifically electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and the directing effects of substituents.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to one another (a 1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of reactions is critical, as existing groups on the ring direct the position of new groups.\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-NH₂ (amino):** Strongly activating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n\nThe presence of reagents for diazotization and deamination (`Fe/HCl`, `NaNO₂/HCl`, `H₃PO₂`) strongly suggests a sophisticated synthesis where an amino group is used as a temporary directing group and then removed.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option Step-by-Step**\n\n*   **Option A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    1.  **i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.** The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n    2.  **ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene** (major product). This step creates a 1,4-pattern, which is incorrect for the desired 1,3,5-pattern.\n    3.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction fails or gives extremely low yields on strongly deactivated rings, such as those containing a nitro group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically unviable.\n\n*   **Option C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    1.  **i) - iv):** This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and finally deamination. This series of reactions converts benzene back into benzene (`C₆H₆ → C₆H₅NO₂ → C₆H₅NH₂ → C₆H₅N₂⁺ → C₆H₆`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence contains a pointless and inefficient loop, making it an incorrect pathway.\n\n*   **Option D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    1.  **i) & ii):** Benzene is converted to aniline (`C₆H₆ → C₆H₅NO₂ → C₆H₅NH₂`).\n    2.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) on Aniline:** This reaction fails. The basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts irreversibly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents acylation of the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically unviable.\n\n*   **Option B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence is complex but represents a valid and clever synthetic strategy.\n    1.  **i) Benzene → Acetophenone.** The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is a good start.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at position 3.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The directing effects are conflicting. The less deactivating -Br group will control the position, directing the nitro group primarily to its *para* position (C4). The major product is **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone**. This is *not* the final product, but a key intermediate.\n    4.  **iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl).** The nitro group at C4 is reduced to an amino group, yielding **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**.\n    5.  **v) Nitration.** The ring now has a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director (-NH₂) at C4. This group completely controls the substitution, directing the new nitro group to its other *ortho* position, C5 (since C3 is blocked). This step unambiguously forms **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone**.\n    6.  **vi) Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl).** The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    7.  **vii) Deamination (H₃PO₂).** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom.\n\n    This final step removes the temporary directing group from C4, yielding the desired final product: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nOptions A, C, and D contain chemically flawed steps. Option B describes a complete, logical, and high-yield synthesis that cleverly uses a temporary directing group to achieve the difficult 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of each proposed pathway is required. The decision must be based on the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution, including the directing effects of substituents and the reactivity of the aromatic ring.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An **acetyl group** (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A **bromo group** (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe key structural feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all substituents are *meta* to one another.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of substitution is critical and is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring:\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-NH₂ (amino):** Strongly activating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option**\n\n**Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n*   Steps i) and ii) correctly synthesize aniline from benzene.\n*   Step iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents acylation of the ring. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option B: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n*   Step i) forms bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   Step ii) involves the nitration of bromobenzene, which would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product). This does not create the required 1,3 relationship.\n*   Step iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. This reaction does not proceed under normal conditions. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n*   Steps i) through iv) describe the nitration of benzene, reduction to aniline, diazotization, and finally deamination to convert the molecule back to benzene. This is a pointless loop that accomplishes nothing. Therefore, this sequence is illogical.\n\n**Option D: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\nThis sequence represents a sophisticated, multi-step synthesis that uses a temporary directing group to achieve the desired substitution pattern with high regioselectivity.\n\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Acetophenone:** A Friedel-Crafts acylation correctly installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director.\n*   **Step ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly guides the bromination to position 3.\n*   **Step iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone:** This is a nitration step. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The directing effects are conflicting, but the major product formed is the 4-nitro isomer, which serves as the key intermediate for the subsequent steps.\n*   **Step iv) Reduction:** The nitro group at position 4 is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂) using Fe/HCl, forming 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone.\n*   **Step v) Nitration:** The ring now contains a powerful activating *ortho, para*-directing amino group. This group controls the substitution, directing the new nitro group to its open *ortho* position (position 5), yielding 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone with high selectivity.\n*   **Step vi) Diazotization:** The amino group at position 4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺) with NaNO₂/HCl.\n*   **Step vii) Deamination:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom using H₃PO₂, yielding the final target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWhile complex, the reaction sequence outlined in **Option D** is the only chemically sound pathway among the choices that leads to the high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. It cleverly uses a nitro group as a precursor to a temporary amino directing group, which ensures the final nitro group is installed in the correct position, before being removed. Options A, B, and C contain fundamental flaws that make them unviable.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent structure is a benzene ring.\n*   There are three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The key structural feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical because existing groups on the ring direct where new groups will attach.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\nThe question asks for a **high-yield** synthesis. This often requires avoiding steps where directing groups conflict, or using more advanced strategies to control regiochemistry. The presence of reagents like `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, and `H3PO2` strongly suggests a strategy involving the formation and subsequent removal of an amino group (a Sandmeyer-type deamination).\n\nLet's analyze the options based on this understanding.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...`\n    The first four steps convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop and cannot be the correct synthetic route.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   Step i: Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    *   Step ii: Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product, since -Br is an o,p-director). This does not establish the required 1,3-relationship.\n    *   Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This reaction fails or gives extremely low yield because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring. This route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    This sequence represents a sophisticated, multi-step synthesis that uses a temporary directing group. Let's trace the steps:\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** (Introduces a meta-director).\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** (The acetyl group directs the bromine to the meta position).\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone.** (This is the crucial step where a simple synthesis would fail to be high-yield. The -Br is an o,p-director and less deactivating than -COCH3, so it directs the nitration primarily to its para position, C4).\n    4.  **iv) Product from (iii) + Fe/HCl → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone.** (The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, which is a powerful activating o,p-director).\n    5.  **v) Product from (iv) + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone.** (The powerful amino group at C4 directs the new nitro group to its ortho position, C5. The other ortho position, C3, is blocked by bromine. This step proceeds with high regioselectivity).\n    6.  **vi) Product from (v) + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt.** (The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt, -N₂⁺).\n    7.  **vii) Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** (The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom).\n\nThis complex sequence is chemically sound and cleverly uses a temporary group (which starts as -NO2 and becomes -NH₂) to control the placement of the final nitro group, before being removed. This is a classic strategy for achieving a high yield of a substitution pattern that is otherwise difficult to obtain.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, B, and D contain fundamentally flawed steps. Option C describes a long but chemically valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a step-by-step analysis of each proposed route is necessary, paying close attention to the directing effects of the substituents and the limitations of certain reactions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Acetyl group (-COCH3)\n    *   Position 3: Bromo group (-Br)\n    *   Position 5: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of substitution is critical. The directing effects of the groups involved are:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThe presence of reagents for reduction (Fe/HCl) and deamination (NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests that a simple, one-after-the-other substitution is not the intended high-yield path. Instead, a more sophisticated strategy using a temporary directing group that is later removed is likely required.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    This sequence begins by converting benzene to nitrobenzene (i), then to aniline (ii), then to a diazonium salt (iii), and finally back to benzene (iv). This four-step loop is nonsensical and inefficient.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    This sequence starts by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails on aniline because the basic amino group (-NH2) reacts irreversibly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring.\n\n*   **Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    This sequence starts by forming bromobenzene (i), then nitrating it (ii) to give mainly 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. This reaction does not proceed under standard conditions.\n\n*   **Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This sequence represents a valid, multi-step strategy that uses a temporary directing group to achieve the desired substitution pattern in high yield.\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **ii) Bromination:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). This leads to a mixture of products, but the major isomer formed is 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone. This will serve as the key intermediate.\n    4.  **iv) Reduction:** The nitro group at position 4 is reduced with Fe/HCl to an amino group (-NH2), forming 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone. The amino group is a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director.\n    5.  **v) Nitration:** The powerful amino group at C4 now controls the substitution. It directs the new nitro group to its *ortho* position, C5 (the other ortho position, C3, is blocked by bromine). This step is highly regioselective, yielding 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone.\n    6.  **vi) Diazotization:** The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺) with NaNO2/HCl.\n    7.  **vii) Deamination:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom using H3PO2.\n\nThis final step removes the temporary directing group, leaving the desired product, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, in high yield. While complex, this is the only chemically sound pathway among the choices that correctly navigates the conflicting directing effects to produce the target molecule with high selectivity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe python script analyzed four potential reaction sequences for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. It evaluated each option based on established principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution, including substituent directing effects and reaction limitations.\n\nThe analysis concluded the following:\n*   **Options A, B, and D** are not viable for a high-yield synthesis. They contain steps that would either fail (e.g., Friedel-Crafts reactions on strongly deactivated rings or on aniline) or result in a low-yield mixture of isomers due to conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Option C** describes a complex but chemically sound multi-step synthesis. This route cleverly uses a nitro group (which is later reduced to an amino group) as a temporary directing group to control the regiochemistry of subsequent substitutions. The final steps involve removing this temporary group via diazotization and deamination to yield the desired 1,3,5-substituted product. This is a valid and sophisticated strategy for achieving a high yield of a product with a challenging substitution pattern.\n\nTherefore, Option C is the only sequence that describes a correct, high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution principles is required.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Substituents:** It has an acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of reactions is critical because existing groups on the ring direct the position of new substituents.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director. This group is formed by the reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl) and can be removed via diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and deamination (H3PO2). The presence of these reagents in the options strongly suggests a complex synthesis involving a temporary directing group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\nA simple, one-by-one addition of the three groups is problematic. For instance, if we perform acylation, then bromination, we get 3-bromoacetophenone. The final nitration step would have conflicting directors (-COCH3 is *meta*, -Br is *ortho, para*), leading to a mixture of products and thus a low yield. A high-yield synthesis requires a more sophisticated strategy.\n\nLet's analyze the most chemically sound, multi-step pathway presented among the candidate answers, which is a sophisticated route designed to control the position of each substituent precisely. This pathway corresponds to the logic presented for option C in several of the more detailed analyses (e.g., Answer 10).\n\n**The Correct High-Yield Synthetic Pathway:**\n\n*   **Step i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This introduces the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director.\n    *   *Product: Acetophenone*\n\n*   **Step ii) Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position.\n    *   *Product: 3-Bromoacetophenone*\n\n*   **Step iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). The less deactivating bromo group will control the position, directing the nitro group to the position *para* to itself (position 4).\n    *   *Product: 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone*\n\n*   **Step iv) Fe/HCl (Reduction):** The nitro group at position 4 is reduced to a temporary amino group (-NH2), which is a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   *Product: 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone*\n\n*   **Step v) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** The powerful amino group now controls the substitution. It directs the new nitro group to its *ortho* position (C5), as the other *ortho* position (C3) is already blocked by bromine. This step is highly selective.\n    *   *Product: 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone*\n\n*   **Step vi) NaNO2/HCl (Diazotization):** The temporary amino group at position 4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n\n*   **Step vii) H3PO2 (Deamination):** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom.\n\nThis sequence successfully removes the temporary directing group, leaving the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This complex but logical pathway is designed to be high-yield by using a temporary group to ensure the correct placement of all substituents. This detailed sequence aligns with the reagents listed in option C, assuming a likely mislabeling in the provided prompt text that was correctly interpreted by some of the more advanced analyses. The other options contain fundamental chemical flaws, such as attempting Friedel-Crafts reactions on strongly deactivated rings or containing nonsensical reaction loops.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of each proposed pathway is required, paying close attention to the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Substituents:** An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to one another.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director. This is relevant as `Fe/HCl` is a reagent used to create it from a nitro group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe prompt requires a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This implies that steps with conflicting directing effects, which would produce a mixture of isomers, should be avoided. The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), and deamination (`H3PO2`) strongly suggests that a complex synthesis using a temporary directing group is the intended high-yield route.\n\nLet's analyze the most plausible option based on this strategy.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n\nThis sequence represents a sophisticated and chemically sound strategy to achieve the difficult 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Step i: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.**\n    This Friedel-Crafts acylation correctly installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director.\n\n*   **Step ii: Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.**\n    The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly positions the incoming bromine at C3.\n\n*   **Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone.**\n    At this stage, the ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). Their effects conflict. The major product formed is the 4-nitro isomer, which will serve as the necessary intermediate for the subsequent steps.\n\n*   **Step iv: Product from (iii) + Fe/HCl → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone.**\n    The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2). This group is a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director and will control the next substitution.\n\n*   **Step v: Product from (iv) + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone.**\n    This is the crucial step for regioselectivity. The powerful amino group at C4 directs the incoming nitro group to its *ortho* positions (C3 and C5). Since C3 is already occupied by bromine, the nitration occurs unambiguously at C5.\n\n*   **Step vi: Product from (v) + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt.**\n    The temporary amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n\n*   **Step vii: Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\n    The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination). This final step removes the temporary directing group, leaving the desired 1,3,5-substituted product.\n\n**Conclusion on Other Options:**\n*   **Options A and B:** These routes fail because they involve Friedel-Crafts reactions on strongly deactivated rings (due to the presence of a nitro group), which are not feasible.\n*   **Option C:** This sequence begins with a series of reactions (i-iv) that convert benzene to nitrobenzene and then back to benzene, which is a nonsensical and unproductive loop.\n\nTherefore, Option D is the only sequence that describes a chemically valid, high-yield synthesis for the target molecule by using an amino group as a temporary, powerful directing group to ensure the correct placement of all substituents before being removed.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
