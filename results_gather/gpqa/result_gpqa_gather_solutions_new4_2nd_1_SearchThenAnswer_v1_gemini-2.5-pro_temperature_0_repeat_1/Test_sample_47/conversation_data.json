This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a classic Favorskii rearrangement, where an α-halo ketone undergoes ring contraction in the presence of a strong base. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring, and the final product is a carboxylic acid. Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine. This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride. Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reaction 4:** Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent that selectively reduces an acyl chloride to an aldehyde. Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the final product (Product 4).**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. The task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this molecule. This is equivalent to determining the number of signals that would appear in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 3: Count the chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.**\n\nTo do this, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n*   The structure is a five-membered cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached.\n*   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that, on a time-averaged basis, passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the rest of the ring.\n*   This symmetry makes the carbons at position 2 and 5 (C2, C5) equivalent to each other, and the carbons at position 3 and 4 (C3, C4) equivalent to each other.\n\nNow, let's count the unique hydrogen environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent. However, the two protons on each carbon are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a prochiral center (C1). This means they are chemically non-equivalent. The \"cis\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C5, and the \"trans\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of protons. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct sets of protons. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5 protons) + 2 (from C3/C4 protons) = **6**.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determining the Structure of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe problem describes a four-step organic synthesis. The identity of the final product must be determined by correctly identifying the outcome of each reaction.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂).**\n    *   This is a standard alpha-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).**\n    *   This reaction involves an α-halo ketone with a strong base, which are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    *   This specific rearrangement involves a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.**\n    *   This is a standard and highly efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (acid chloride). The -OH group is replaced by a -Cl atom.\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).**\n    *   This reagent is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. Its specific and common use is the selective reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes. The reaction stops at the aldehyde stage and does not proceed to the alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\nThe reaction sequence is robust and all candidate answers that provide a detailed analysis correctly identify the final product as cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### **Part 2: Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe task is to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to predicting the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a five-membered cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons.\n*   **Symmetry:** To count the distinct hydrogens, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the ring.\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:**\n    *   The carbon at position 2 (C2) is chemically equivalent to the carbon at position 5 (C5).\n    *   The carbon at position 3 (C3) is chemically equivalent to the carbon at position 4 (C4).\n\nLet's count the distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The single hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment.\n    *   **Count: 1 type**\n\n2.  **The C1 Proton:** The single hydrogen atom on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. It lies on the plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Count: 1 type**\n\n3.  **The C2 and C5 Protons:** These two carbons are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other. They are **diastereotopic** because they are on a carbon adjacent to a stereocenter (C1). One proton is spatially closer to the aldehyde group (\"cis\") while the other is further away (\"trans\"). They are in different chemical environments. By symmetry, the \"cis\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C5, and the \"trans\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of protons from these four hydrogens.\n    *   **Count: 2 types**\n\n4.  **The C3 and C4 Protons:** The same logic applies here. C3 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The four hydrogens on C3 and C4 also form two distinct sets. These sets are different from the C2/C5 protons due to their greater distance from the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group.\n    *   **Count: 2 types**\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Sequence and Products**\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine → Product 1**\n    *   This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The reaction places a bromine atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH (heated) → Product 2**\n    *   This is the Favorskii rearrangement of an α-halo ketone with a strong base. This reaction is characterized by a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone becomes a five-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) → Product 3**\n    *   This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride. The -OH group is replaced by a -Cl atom.\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    *   This reagent is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes. The reaction stops at the aldehyde stage.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**2. Analyze the Structure of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. The task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this molecule. This is equivalent to determining the number of signals that would appear in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**3. Count the Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nTo count the distinct hydrogens, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A five-membered cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the rest of the ring.\n*   **Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The aldehyde proton:** The single hydrogen attached to the carbonyl carbon is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **The C1 proton:** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. It lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n    3.  **The C2 and C5 protons:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic because C1 is a prochiral center. The same is true for C5. By symmetry, the \"upper\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent, and the \"lower\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent. This gives two distinct sets of protons. (2 types)\n    4.  **The C3 and C4 protons:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct sets of protons.

It consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached.\n*   **Symmetry:** To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogens (which corresponds to the number of signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum), we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. On the NMR timescale, the rapid puckering of the cyclopentane ring creates an *effective* plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon (the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the ring, making C2 equivalent to C5, and C3 equivalent to C4.\n*   **Counting the distinct hydrogen environments:**\n    1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment.

However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are **diastereotopic** because C1 is a stereocenter. This means they are in different chemical environments. By symmetry, the \"upper\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"upper\" proton on C5, and the \"lower\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"lower\" proton on C5. This gives **two** distinct sets of hydrogens from these four protons.\n    4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another **two** distinct sets of hydrogens.\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5 protons) + 2 (from C3/C4 protons) = **6**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence reliably produces cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.

It is treated with bromine (Br₂). This is a classic alpha-halogenation reaction of a ketone, where a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base. An α-halo ketone treated with a strong base undergoes a well-known reaction called the Favorskii rearrangement. This process involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate, which then rearranges to cause a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.

The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of Product 4**\nProduct 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. Its specific function is to reduce reactive functional groups like acyl chlorides to aldehydes, without reducing the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Step 5: Count the chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4**\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. This is equivalent to determining the number of unique signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a five-membered cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached.\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The single hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment.

This plane makes the carbons C2 and C5 equivalent, and the carbons C3 and C4 equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C5:** The two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic because C1 is a prochiral center. One proton is spatially closer to the aldehyde group (\"cis\") while the other is further (\"trans\"). The same applies to C5. Due to the plane of symmetry, the two \"cis\" protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two \"trans\" protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **two** more distinct types of hydrogens.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The two \"cis-like\" protons on C3 and C4 are equivalent, and the two \"trans-like\" protons are equivalent. This gives another **two** distinct types of hydrogens.\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (methine C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

It is specifically used to reduce reactive functional groups like acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**2. Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. This is equivalent to determining the number of signals that would appear in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a five-membered cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (the H, C, and O atoms), the C1 carbon of the ring, and the hydrogen atom attached to C1. This plane bisects the rest of the ring, making C2 equivalent to C5 and C3 equivalent to C4.\n\nLet's count the sets of non-equivalent hydrogen atoms based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton:** The single hydrogen atom of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. (1 distinct type)\n2.  **The C1 proton:** The single hydrogen atom on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. It lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 distinct type)\n3.  **The C2 and C5 protons:** The carbons C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic because they are on a carbon adjacent to a prochiral center (C1). One proton is in a different spatial relationship to the aldehyde group than the other. By symmetry, the \"upper\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"upper\" proton on C5, and the \"lower\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"lower\" proton on C5. This gives two distinct types of hydrogens from these four protons. (2 distinct types)\n4.  **The C3 and C4 protons:** Similarly, carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. This results in two more distinct types of hydrogens from these four protons. (2 distinct types)\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1, bisecting the rest of the ring. This symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C5, and C3 equivalent to C4.\n*   **Counting the distinct hydrogen sets:**\n    1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n    3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent. However, the two protons on each carbon are **diastereotopic** because they are adjacent to a stereocenter (C1). This means they are chemically non-equivalent. The \"upper\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"upper\" proton on C5, and the \"lower\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"lower\" proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of protons for these four hydrogens. (2 types)\n    4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent.

It has a five-membered ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** To count the number of chemically distinct hydrogens (which corresponds to the number of signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum), we must consider the molecule's structure and symmetry. The cyclopentane ring is not planar and undergoes rapid conformational changes (puckering). On the NMR timescale, this rapid interconversion results in an *average* structure that possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon it is attached to, and the C1-H bond, bisecting the rest of the ring.\n*   **Counting the distinct hydrogen environments:**\n    1.  **Type 1:** The aldehyde proton (H-C=O).

A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is substituted by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, the reaction at either α-position yields the same product.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nThis is a classic reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base, known as the **Favorskii rearrangement**. The reaction mechanism involves the deprotonation of the other α-carbon (C6), followed by an intramolecular cyclization to form a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. Subsequent attack by the hydroxide nucleophile on the carbonyl carbon leads to the opening of the strained ring, resulting in a ring contraction.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard laboratory procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride (or acid chloride).

This accounts for a **second** type of hydrogen.\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group and C1. This makes the methylene group at C2 chemically equivalent to the one at C5. However, within each methylene group, the two hydrogen atoms are **diastereotopic**. This is because they are adjacent to a stereocenter (C1), meaning one is in a different spatial relationship to the aldehyde group than the other.

    "Based on a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product, here is the definitive breakdown to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 4**\n\nThe four-step synthesis is a sequence of standard organic reactions.\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1:** This is an α-bromination of a ketone. A bromine atom replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n2.  **Product 1 + NaOH (heat) → Product 2:** This is the **Favorskii rearrangement**, a characteristic reaction of α-halo ketones with a strong base. The key outcome is a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of the starting material becomes a five-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n3.  **Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂) → Product 3:** This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n4.  **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4:** This reagent, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃, is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. Its specific purpose is to reduce an acyl chloride to an aldehyde, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n### **Step 2: Count the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. The task is to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments, which corresponds to the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to one carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The cyclopentane ring is not planar, but it undergoes rapid conformational changes (puckering). On the NMR time scale, this results in a time-averaged structure that possesses an effective **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon, and the hydrogen on C1, bisecting the rest of the ring.\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:** This symmetry makes the carbon at position 2 (C2) equivalent to the carbon at position 5 (C5). It also makes the carbon at position 3 (C3) equivalent to the carbon at position 4 (C4).\n\nLet's count the distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The single hydrogen of the -CHO group is in a completely unique environment.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n2.  **The C1 Proton:** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. It is a methine proton (CH) that lies on the plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n3.  **The C2 and C5 Protons:** These two carbons are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are **diastereotopic** because they are on a carbon adjacent to a stereocenter (C1). This means they are chemically non-equivalent. The same is true for the protons on C5. Due to the plane of symmetry, the \"cis\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C5, and the \"trans\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of protons from these four hydrogens.\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n4.  **The C3 and C4 Protons:** The same logic applies. C3 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. These four protons form another two distinct sets, which are different from the C2/C5 protons due to their greater distance from the aldehyde group.\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n### **Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5 protons) + 2 (from C3/C4 protons) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

An α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other α-carbon undergoes a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, which then opens up, resulting in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n### Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3\nProduct 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.

This led to the correct identification of the final product, Product 4, as cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\nNext, the code analyzed the structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. It correctly identified a plane of symmetry and accounted for diastereotopic protons on the cyclopentane ring. The analysis broke down the hydrogen environments as follows:\n*   1 unique aldehyde proton.\n*   1 unique proton on the ring carbon (C1) attached to the aldehyde.\n*   2 distinct sets of protons on the C2/C5 carbons.\n*   2 distinct sets of protons on the C3/C4 carbons.\n\nSumming these distinct environments (1 + 1 + 2 + 2) resulted in a total of 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations and the final product structure.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is substituted by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, the reaction at either α-position yields the same product.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nThis is a classic reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base, known as the **Favorskii rearrangement**. The reaction mechanism involves the deprotonation of the other α-carbon (C6), followed by an intramolecular cyclization to form a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. Subsequent attack by the hydroxide nucleophile on the carbonyl carbon leads to the opening of the strained ring, resulting in a ring contraction.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard laboratory procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride (or acid chloride). The hydroxyl (-OH) group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive functional groups like acyl chlorides to aldehydes. Its bulk and reduced reactivity prevent the over-reduction of the aldehyde to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. This is equivalent to predicting the number of unique signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) substituent.\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The single hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. This accounts for **one** type of hydrogen.\n2.  **The Methine Proton:** The single hydrogen atom on the ring carbon to which the aldehyde group is attached (C1) is also in a unique environment. This accounts for a **second** type of hydrogen.\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group and C1. This makes the methylene group at C2 chemically equivalent to the one at C5. However, within each methylene group, the two hydrogen atoms are **diastereotopic**. This is because they are adjacent to a stereocenter (C1), meaning one is in a different spatial relationship to the aldehyde group than the other. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 give rise to **two** distinct signals.\n4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes the methylene group at C3 equivalent to the one at C4. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. These four protons are further from the aldehyde group than the C2/C5 protons, so they are in a different chemical environment. They give rise to another **two** distinct signals.\n\nIn total, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is the sum of these types: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (methine) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Reaction Sequence and Final Product\n\nAll candidate answers that provide a detailed chemical analysis agree on the four-step reaction sequence. This consensus strongly indicates the correct pathway.\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone + Bromine → Product 1:** This is an alpha-bromination of a ketone. The product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n2.  **Product 1 + NaOH (heat) → Product 2:** This is a classic Favorskii rearrangement of an α-halo ketone. The reaction involves a ring contraction of the six-membered ring to a five-membered ring, forming a carboxylic acid. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n3.  **Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂) → Product 3:** This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride. The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n4.  **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4:** This reagent is a mild, selective reducing agent that reduces an acyl chloride to an aldehyde. The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of Product 4 for Chemically Distinct Hydrogens\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. The task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, which corresponds to the number of signals expected in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** A five-membered cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** We must analyze the molecule's symmetry. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C-H and C=O bonds), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the ring.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The single hydrogen of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** distinct type.\n    2.  **The C1 Proton:** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. This is a **2nd** distinct type.\n    3.  **The C2/C5 Protons:** Due to the plane of symmetry, carbon C2 is equivalent to carbon C5. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are **diastereotopic** because C1 is a stereocenter. This means they are in different chemical environments. By symmetry, the \"upper\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"upper\" proton on C5, and the \"lower\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"lower\" proton on C5. This gives **2** more distinct types of hydrogens.\n    4.  **The C3/C4 Protons:** Similarly, carbon C3 is equivalent to carbon C4. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. This gives another **2** distinct types of hydrogens.\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\n### Step 3: Compare with Candidate Answers and Decide\n\nThe correct number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 6. The options are:\nA) 7\nB) 6\nC) 8\nD) 10\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n*   Most of the candidate answers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17) correctly deduce the structure and correctly reason that there are 6 distinct hydrogen atoms.\n*   However, only **Answer 5** correctly pairs this reasoning with the final answer choice <<<B>>>. Many other answers have correct reasoning but select an incorrect letter (e.g., Answer 1 selects C, Answer 2 selects D, etc.), indicating a mismatch between their analysis and their final choice.\n*   Answer 12 arrives at the wrong number of hydrogens (10) in its reasoning but happens to select the correct final letter <<<B>>>. Its reasoning is flawed because it incorrectly assumes the absence of any symmetry.\n\nBased on the overwhelming consensus in the chemical reasoning and identifying the only answer where the reasoning correctly matches the selected option, the final answer is 6.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
