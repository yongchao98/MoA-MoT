These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nB) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nC) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nD) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the correct reactants and major final products.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleophile (Michael Donor):** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, which is acidic due to its position between two electron-withdrawing ester groups. This creates a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`, which acts as the nucleophile.\n2.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group and is the site of nucleophilic attack.\n3.  **Determine the Product (A):** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate in a conjugate addition. The resulting enolate intermediate is then protonated by the ethanol solvent. The new C-C bond forms between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting structure is `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.\n    *   To name this compound according to the options, we can identify a three-carbon propane backbone. The two methoxycarbonyl groups from the malonate are on C1, the p-tolyl group is on C2, and the final methoxycarbonyl group is on C3.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) → (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleophile (Michael Donor):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone. In this Stork enamine synthesis, the enamine acts as a nucleophile at the α-carbon of the original ketone.\n2.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, which serves as the Michael acceptor.\n3.  **Determine the Product (B):** The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium salt back to a ketone. The overall result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at the α-position.\n    *   The group added to the cyclohexanone ring is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   The final product is the keto tautomer, which is more stable than the enol form.\n    *   Naming the product with the nitrile as the principal functional group gives the name **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):** We are given the product and the Michael acceptor and must identify the Michael donor (C).\n2.  **Identify the Components:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK). After the reaction, this becomes the `-(CH₂)₂COCH₃` (3-oxobutyl) group.\n3.  **Determine the Reactant (C):** The 3-oxobutyl group is attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. In a Michael addition, the bond forms between the nucleophile and the β-carbon of the acceptor. This means the C2 of the dione ring acted as the nucleophile. The protons at C2 of a 1,3-dione are highly acidic and are readily removed by the base (KOH) to form the required enolate.\n    *   Therefore, the starting reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination of products and reactant corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the three reactions to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the highly acidic α-carbon of dimethyl malonate (the carbon between the two ester groups) to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester.

The β-carbon (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n*   **Determine Product Structure (A):**\n    *   The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent, ethanol (EtOH), at the α-carbon.\n    *   The final product structure is `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.\n*   **Name Product (A):**\n    *   To name this compound according to the options, we consider a propane backbone formed by the malonate carbon and the α and β carbons of the acrylate.\n    *   The structure can be written as `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.\n    *   Numbering this propane chain, we have two methoxycarbonyl groups at C1, a p-tolyl group at C2, and a methoxycarbonyl group at C3.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction B**\n*   **Reaction:** `1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)`\n*   **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   The Michael donor is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which acts as a nucleophilic equivalent of the enolate of cyclohexanone. The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the original ketone.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Determine Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium ion back to a ketone.\n    *   The reaction adds a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group to the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   The major final product is the thermodynamically more stable keto tautomer, not the enol form.\n*   **Name Product (B):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile, so the parent chain is butanenitrile.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain. The substituent is named `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction C**\n*   **Reaction:** `C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`\n*   **Identify Reactant C (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of the acceptor. After protonation, the MVK molecule becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` group, which is the `(3-oxobutyl)` group seen in the product.\n    *   This group is attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. This means the C2 carbon of the dione was the nucleophile.\n    *   The protons at the C2 position of a 1,3-dione are highly acidic and are readily removed by a base like KOH to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, the reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The alternative, `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`, is not the correct representation of the starting diketone.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nNow, we compare this set of correct answers with the given options:\n*   A) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect)\n*   B) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n*   C) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Correct)\n*   D) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect)\n\nOption C is the only one that correctly identifies all three components.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the correct reactants and products.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`.

In a Michael addition, the bond forms between the nucleophile and the β-carbon of the acceptor. This means the C2 of the dione ring acted as the nucleophile.

The β-carbon (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n*   **Determine Product Structure (A):**\n    *   The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent, ethanol (EtOH), at the α-carbon.\n    *   The final product structure is `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.\n*   **Name Product (A):**\n    *   To name this compound according to the options, we consider a propane backbone formed by the malonate carbon and the α and β carbons of the acrylate.\n    *   The structure can be written as `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.\n    *   Numbering this propane chain, we have two methoxycarbonyl groups at C1, a p-tolyl group at C2, and a methoxycarbonyl group at C3.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction B**\n*   **Reaction:** `1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)`\n*   **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   The Michael donor is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which acts as a nucleophilic equivalent of the enolate of cyclohexanone. The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the original ketone.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Determine Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium ion back to a ketone.\n    *   The reaction adds a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group to the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   The major final product is the thermodynamically more stable keto tautomer, not the enol form.\n*   **Name Product (B):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile, so the parent chain is butanenitrile.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain. The substituent is named `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction C**\n*   **Reaction:** `C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`\n*   **Identify Reactant C (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of the acceptor. After protonation, the MVK molecule becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` group, which is the `(3-oxobutyl)` group seen in the product.\n    *   This group is attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. This means the C2 carbon of the dione was the nucleophile.\n    *   The protons at the C2 position of a 1,3-dione are highly acidic and are readily removed by a base like KOH to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, the reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The alternative, `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`, is not the correct representation of the starting diketone.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nNow, we compare this set of correct answers with the given options:\n*   A) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect)\n*   B) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n*   C) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Correct)\n*   D) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect)\n\nOption C is the only one that correctly identifies all three components.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the correct reactants and products.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`.
