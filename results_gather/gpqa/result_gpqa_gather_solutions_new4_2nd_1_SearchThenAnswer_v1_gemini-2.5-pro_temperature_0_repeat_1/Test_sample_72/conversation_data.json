We must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, which is derived from the Lorentz transformations.\n\nThe formula for the relative speed of two objects moving in the same direction with velocities `v₁` and `v₂` is:\n`v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n\n**Given values:**\n*   `v₁ = 0.6c`\n*   `v₂ = 0.5c`\n\n**Calculation:**\n1.  Substitute the given values into the formula:\n    `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n2.  Simplify the numerator and the term in the denominator:\n    `v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c²/c²)`\n3.  Finalize the calculation:\n    `v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c`\n4.  Convert the fraction to a decimal to match the options:\n    `v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E_total)\n\n**Careful Point:** The total energy of a relativistic particle includes both its rest energy and its kinetic energy. The formula is `E = γmc²`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) accounts for the relativistic effects. The total energy of the system is the simple sum of the individual total energies of the non-interacting astronauts.\n\nThe Lorentz factor `γ` is calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n**Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass: `m₁ = 2m`\n*   Velocity: `v₁ = 0.6c`\n*   Lorentz factor (`γ₁`):\n    `γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6)²)` = `1 / √(1 - 0.36)` = `1 / √0.64` = `1 / 0.8` = **1.25**\n*   Energy (`E₁`):\n    `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c²` = `1.25 * (2m) * c²` = **2.5 mc²**\n\n**Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass: `m₂ = 3m`\n*   Velocity: `v₂ = 0.5c`\n*   Lorentz factor (`γ₂`):\n    `γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5)²)` = `1 / √(1 - 0.25)` = `1 / √0.75` = `1 / (√3 / 2)` = **2 / √3** ≈ **1.1547**\n*   Energy (`E₂`):\n    `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c²` = `(2 / √3) * (3m) * c²` = `2√3 mc²` ≈ **3.464 mc²**\n\n**Calculation for Total System Energy:**\n*   `E_total = E₁ + E₂`\n*   `E_total = 2.5 mc² + 2√3 mc²`\n*   `E_total = (2.5 + 2√3) mc²`\n*   `E_total ≈ (2.5 + 3.464) mc²` = **5.964 mc²**\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   Total energy `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nD) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Physics Problem**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\n*   The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between them.\n*   The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the system as measured from a stationary frame.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Use Relativistic Formulas**\nSince the speeds (0.6c and 0.5c) are significant fractions of the speed of light (c), classical formulas for velocity and energy are not applicable. We must use the formulas from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\n**Careful Point 2: Correct Velocity Transformation**\nFor two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ in a stationary frame, the relative speed is not a simple subtraction. The correct Lorentz velocity transformation formula must be used:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n**Calculation:**\n*   Given: $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n*   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n*   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n*   $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### **3. Calculation of Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\n**Careful Point 3: Total Relativistic Energy**\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy, given by the formula $E = \\gamma mc^2$. The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts.\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\nwhere the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, is given by $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n**Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}) \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total System Energy:**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n*   $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ **0.14c**\n*   Total energy ($E_{total}$) ≈ **5.96 mc²**\n\n**Careful Point 4: Matching Results to Options**\nWe must now compare our calculated results with the given options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nC) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n\nOur calculated values, $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$ and $E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$, perfectly match option C. An analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most performed the calculations correctly, many failed at this final step of matching the result to the correct option letter.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

Analysis of the Question**\nThe problem asks for two distinct physical quantities for a system of two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds:\n*   **Relative Speed (v_rel):** The speed of one astronaut as measured from the other's reference frame.\n*   **Total Energy (E_total):** The sum of the total relativistic energies of both astronauts as measured from a stationary reference frame.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation and Careful Points**\n\n#### **Part A: Calculating the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to use classical velocity subtraction (i.e., `0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c`). This is incorrect because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light (`c`), requiring the use of the relativistic velocity transformation formula. This incorrect classical calculation leads to the `v_rel` value in option C.\n*   **Correct Method:** The Lorentz transformation for velocities moving in the same direction is:\n    `v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Given `v₁ = 0.6c` and `v₂ = 0.5c`.\n    *   `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n    *   `v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n    *   `v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n    *   `v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n*   **Result:** The relative speed, rounded to two decimal places, is **0.14c**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n#### **Part B: Calculating the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Another common mistake is to calculate only the total rest energy of the system by simply adding the masses (`(2m + 3m)c² = 5mc²`). This ignores the significant kinetic energy the astronauts have due to their high speeds. This incorrect calculation leads to the energy value in option D.\n*   **Correct Method:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of each astronaut. The formula for a single particle's total energy is `E = γmc²`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass `m₁ = 2m`, Velocity `v₁ = 0.6c`.\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - 0.6²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`.\n    *   Energy `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`.\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass `m₂ = 3m`, Velocity `v₂ = 0.5c`.\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - 0.5²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1.1547`.\n    *   Energy `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²`.\n*   **Total Energy Calculation:**\n    *   `E_total = E₁ + E₂ ≈ 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²`.\n*   **Result:** The total energy, rounded to two decimal places, is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\nThe calculations yield a relative speed of approximately **0.14c** and a total energy of approximately **5.96 mc²**. These results match the values presented in option A. While many of the provided candidate answers perform the correct calculations, several incorrectly map their results to the wrong letter option.

Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\n*   **Concept:** When dealing with speeds that are a significant fraction of the speed of light (c), we cannot simply subtract one velocity from the other. We must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, which is derived from the Lorentz transformations.\n*   **Formula:** For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities v₁ and v₂ as measured from a stationary frame, their relative speed (v_rel) is given by:\n    `v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n*   **Given Values:**\n    *   v₁ = 0.6c\n    *   v₂ = 0.5c\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\n    *   v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c²/c²)\n    *   v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\n    *   v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n    *   v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Energy of the System (E_total)**\n\n*   **Concept:** The total energy of a system of non-interacting particles is the sum of the individual total energies of each particle. The total energy of a single particle includes its rest energy and its kinetic energy, given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Formulae:**\n    *   E_total = E₁ + E₂\n    *   Lorentz factor: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass (m₁) = 2m\n    *   Velocity (v₁) = 0.6c\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ₁): γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - 0.6²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n    *   Energy (E₁): E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = **2.5 mc²**\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass (m₂) = 3m\n    *   Velocity (v₂) = 0.5c\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ₂): γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - 0.5²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1.1547\n    *   Energy (E₂): E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ **3.464 mc²**\n*   **Calculation for Total Energy:**\n    *   E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Velocity Subtraction:** A common mistake is to use classical velocity subtraction (0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c), which ignores relativistic effects. This would incorrectly point to option A.\n*   **Energy Calculation:** Another potential error is to calculate the total rest energy by simply adding the masses (`(2m + 3m)c² = 5mc²`). This ignores the kinetic energy of the astronauts and would incorrectly point to option D.\n*   **Summation of Energies:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of its components, not an energy calculated from a combined mass or average velocity.\n*   **Matching Results to Options:** After performing the calculations correctly, it is crucial to match both calculated values (v_rel ≈ 0.14c and E ≈ 5.96 mc²) to the given options.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOur calculated values are a relative speed of approximately **0.14c** and a total energy of approximately **5.96 mc²**. Comparing these results with the provided choices:\n\n*   A) v_rel = 0.1c , E= 4.96 mc²\n*   B) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc²\n*   C) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc²\n*   D) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc²\n\nThe correct option is B, as it matches both of our calculated values.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Relativistic Speeds:** The astronauts are traveling at speeds that are a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.6c and 0.5c).

The correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, as the observers (the astronauts) are in different inertial frames.\n3.  **Total Energy Calculation:** The total energy of a particle is not just its rest energy (`mc²`) or its classical kinetic energy. It is the total relativistic energy, given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n4.  **System Energy:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of each astronaut, as measured from the same stationary reference frame.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**1.

The result was approximately `0.14c`.\n\nSecond, it calculated the total energy of the system. This was done by finding the Lorentz factor (`γ`) for each astronaut and using it in the total relativistic energy formula (`E = γmc²`). The individual energies were then summed.

Calculation of the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual *total relativistic energies* of the astronauts. The total relativistic energy of a particle includes both its rest energy and its kinetic energy.\n*   **Formula:** The total energy of a single particle is `E = γmc²`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the insights from the provided answers and highlighting the crucial points for accuracy.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe question requires the calculation of two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\n1.  **Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$):** The speed of one astronaut as measured from the other's reference frame.\n2.  **Total Energy ($E_{total}$):** The sum of the total relativistic energies of both astronauts as measured from a stationary (lab) reference frame.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to use classical velocity subtraction (e.g., 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c). Because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light (c), the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, derived from the Lorentz transformations, must be used. The incorrect classical calculation leads to the `v_rel` value seen in option D.\n\n*   **Formula:** For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ in a stationary frame, their relative speed is:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Given: $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\n*   **Result:** The relative speed, rounded to two decimal places, is **0.14c**.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculation of Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Another frequent error is to calculate the total rest energy by simply summing the masses and using $E=mc^2$ (i.e., $(2m + 3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$). This ignores the substantial kinetic energy the astronauts possess due to their high speeds. This incorrect calculation leads to the energy value seen in option C. The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual *total relativistic energies* of each astronaut.\n\n*   **Formula:** The total energy of a single particle is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. The total energy of the system is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass: $m_1 = 2m$, Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n    *   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$): $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Energy ($E_1$): $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass: $m_2 = 3m$, Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n    *   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$): $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Energy ($E_2$): $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}) \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Total Energy:**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    *   $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\n*   **Result:** The total energy, rounded to two decimal places, is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe rigorous step-by-step calculation yields the following values:\n*   **Relative speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ 0.14c**\n*   **Total energy ($E_{total}$) ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nB) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nD) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option B. The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most performed the calculations correctly, there was confusion in matching the result to the correct letter, likely due to variations in the option ordering they were presented with.

This incorrect classical calculation leads to the `v_rel` value in option C.\n*   **Correct Method:** The Lorentz transformation for velocities moving in the same direction is:\n    `v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Given `v₁ = 0.6c` and `v₂ = 0.5c`.\n    *   `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n    *   `v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n    *   `v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n    *   `v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n*   **Result:** The relative speed, rounded to two decimal places, is **0.14c**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n#### **Part B: Calculating the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Another common mistake is to calculate only the total rest energy of the system by simply adding the masses (`(2m + 3m)c² = 5mc²`). This ignores the significant kinetic energy the astronauts have due to their high speeds. This incorrect calculation leads to the energy value in option D.\n*   **Correct Method:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of each astronaut. The formula for a single particle's total energy is `E = γmc²`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass `m₁ = 2m`, Velocity `v₁ = 0.6c`.\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - 0.6²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`.\n    *   Energy `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`.\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass `m₂ = 3m`, Velocity `v₂ = 0.5c`.\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - 0.5²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1.1547`.\n    *   Energy `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²`.\n*   **Total Energy Calculation:**\n    *   `E_total = E₁ + E₂ ≈ 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²`.\n*   **Result:** The total energy, rounded to two decimal places, is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **3.

Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\n*   **Concept:** When dealing with speeds that are a significant fraction of the speed of light (c), we cannot simply subtract one velocity from the other. We must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, which is derived from the Lorentz transformations.\n*   **Formula:** For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities v₁ and v₂ as measured from a stationary frame, their relative speed (v_rel) is given by:\n    `v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n*   **Given Values:**\n    *   v₁ = 0.6c\n    *   v₂ = 0.5c\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\n    *   v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c²/c²)\n    *   v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\n    *   v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n    *   v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Energy of the System (E_total)**\n\n*   **Concept:** The total energy of a system of non-interacting particles is the sum of the individual total energies of each particle. The total energy of a single particle includes its rest energy and its kinetic energy, given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Formulae:**\n    *   E_total = E₁ + E₂\n    *   Lorentz factor: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass (m₁) = 2m\n    *   Velocity (v₁) = 0.6c\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ₁): γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - 0.6²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n    *   Energy (E₁): E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = **2.5 mc²**\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass (m₂) = 3m\n    *   Velocity (v₂) = 0.5c\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ₂): γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - 0.5²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1.1547\n    *   Energy (E₂): E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ **3.464 mc²**\n*   **Calculation for Total Energy:**\n    *   E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Velocity Subtraction:** A common mistake is to use classical velocity subtraction (0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c), which ignores relativistic effects. This would incorrectly point to option A.\n*   **Energy Calculation:** Another potential error is to calculate the total rest energy by simply adding the masses (`(2m + 3m)c² = 5mc²`). This ignores the kinetic energy of the astronauts and would incorrectly point to option D.\n*   **Summation of Energies:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of its components, not an energy calculated from a combined mass or average velocity.\n*   **Matching Results to Options:** After performing the calculations correctly, it is crucial to match both calculated values (v_rel ≈ 0.14c and E ≈ 5.96 mc²) to the given options.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOur calculated values are a relative speed of approximately **0.14c** and a total energy of approximately **5.96 mc²**.

It is not simply the sum of their rest masses (`(2m + 3m)c²`).\n*   **Formula:** `E_total = E1 + E2 = (γ1 * m1 * c²) + (γ2 * m2 * c²)`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n*   **Astronaut 1:**\n    *   `m1 = 2m`, `v1 = 0.6c`\n    *   `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    *   `E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n*   **Astronaut 2:**\n    *   `m2 = 3m`, `v2 = 0.5c`\n    *   `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n    *   `E2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n\n*   **Total Energy:**\n    *   `E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²`\n    *   `E_total ≈ 5.964 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **4. Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculations yield:\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   **A) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc²**\n*   B) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc²\n*   C) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc²\n*   D) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc²\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option A. Most of the provided candidate answers performed the calculation correctly, but some failed to match the result to the correct letter option. The physics and mathematics consistently point to the values in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
