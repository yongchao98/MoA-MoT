    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate (`CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`), methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-COOCH₃`), and sodium ethoxide (`NaOEt`) in ethanol (`EtOH`).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The base, sodium ethoxide (`EtO⁻`), is strong enough to deprotonate the acidic α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, which is located between the two electron-withdrawing ester groups. This forms a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`. This enolate acts as the Michael donor (nucleophile).\n    2.  Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the Michael acceptor. It is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the double bond (the carbon atom attached to the p-tolyl group).\n    3.  The attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. This generates another enolate intermediate.\n    4.  This enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final neutral product.\n*   **Product Structure (A):**\n    *   The nucleophile `CH(COOCH₃)₂` adds to the β-carbon of `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`.\n    *   The resulting structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Product Name (A):**\n    *   We need to find the correct IUPAC name for the product `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   Let's analyze the names provided in the options. The name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` describes a propane main chain (`C1-C2-C3`) with three methyl carboxylate groups and a p-tolyl group.\n    *   According to this name:\n        *   Two methoxycarbonyl (`-COOCH₃`) groups are at position 1.\n        *   One p-tolyl group is at position 2.\n        *   One methoxycarbonyl (`-COOCH₃`) group is at position 3.\n    *   This corresponds to the structure `(CH₃OOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-Tolyl)-CH₂(3)-COOCH₃`. This structure perfectly matches the one we derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    *   The other name option, `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate`, would correspond to the structure `(CH₃OOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(COOCH₃)-CH₂(3)-(p-Tolyl)`, which is incorrect.\n    *   Therefore, product **A** is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which is a variation of the Michael addition. The enamine acts as the nucleophile.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The enamine, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine (formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine), is the Michael donor. The α-carbon of the enamine (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) is nucleophilic.\n    2.  This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`).\n    3.  This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    4.  The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺`) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   **Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The bond forms between the C2 of the original cyclohexanone and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The group added to the cyclohexanone ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with the `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group at the α-position (C2).\n*   **Product Name (B):**\n    *   The structure is 2-substituted cyclohexanone. Let's analyze the name `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n    *   This name treats butanenitrile as the parent chain: `C(4)H₃-C(3)H-C(2)H₂-C(1)N`.\n    *   A `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group is attached at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   This name accurately describes the product we derived.\n    *   The other name option, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol form of the product. While some enol may exist, the acidic workup (`H₃O⁺`) ensures that the major final product is the ketone (keto-enol tautomerism favors the keto form for simple ketones).\n    *   Therefore, product **B** is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** An unknown reactant **C** and but-3-en-2-one (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`, also known as methyl vinyl ketone or MVK).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the Michael donor.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    2.  The Michael acceptor is but-3-en-2-one (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`). When a nucleophile attacks its β-carbon (`CH₂`), the resulting fragment that gets attached to the nucleophile is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`. This is precisely the `(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product name.\n    3.  This means the nucleophile (Michael donor) must be the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The base (`KOH`) deprotonates the highly acidic carbon at position 2 (between the two carbonyls) to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Reactant C:**\n    *   The starting material that forms this enolate is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The options provide `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` and `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione` (which is likely a misnomer for the enol form, `3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one`).\n    *   Although 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds have a significant enol content, the standard representation for the reactant is the diketo form.\n    *   Therefore, reactant **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
