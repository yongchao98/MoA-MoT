    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Particle Decay and Relativity**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** Unstable particles decay over time. The number of particles ($N$) remaining from an initial sample ($N_0$) after a time ($t$) in their own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law: $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau_0}$, where $\\tau_0$ is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n*   **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of an observer in the laboratory frame (the detector), the lifetime of a moving particle is \"stretched\" or dilated. The dilated lifetime, $\\tau_{lab}$, is related to the proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$: $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor describes the extent of time dilation and length contraction. It's defined as $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $c$ is the speed of light.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Particles:** The problem states the particles have ultra-relativistic velocities. This means their speed $v$ is very close to the speed of light $c$. For our calculations, we can make the excellent approximation that $v \\approx c$.\n\n**2. Set up the Equations for the Scenario**\n\n*   A particle is created at the center of the detector and travels towards the inner wall.\n*   The distance it must travel in the lab frame is the radius of the detector, $R = 30$ m.\n*   The time it takes to travel this distance in the lab frame is $t_{lab} = \\text{distance} / \\text{speed} \\approx R/c$.\n*   The number of particles that survive this journey to the detector wall is given by the decay law, using the time and lifetime as measured in the lab frame:\n    $N = N_0 e^{-t_{lab}/\\tau_{lab}}$\n*   The fraction of particles that survive is $f = N/N_0$.\n    $f = e^{-t_{lab}/\\tau_{lab}}$\n\n**3. Substitute the Relativistic Expressions**\n\n*   Substitute $t_{lab} \\approx R/c$ and $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$ into the survival fraction equation:\n    $f = e^{-(R/c) / (\\gamma \\tau_0)}$\n    $f = e^{-R / (c \\gamma \\tau_0)}$\n\n*   This equation relates the survival fraction ($f$) to the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$). The other quantities ($R$, $c$, $\\tau_0$) are constants for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's group them into a single constant, $K = R/(c \\tau_0)$.\n    $f = e^{-K/\\gamma}$\n\n**4. Use the Given Information to Find the Relationship**\n\nWe have two conditions:\n\n*   **Condition 1:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1 = 20$.\n    *   Survival fraction, $f_1 = 1/3$.\n*   **Condition 2:**\n    *   Survival fraction, $f_2 = 2/3$.\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$.\n\nLet's apply our equation to both conditions. It's easier to work with the natural logarithm of the equation:\n$\\ln(f) = -K/\\gamma$\n$\\ln(1/f) = K/\\gamma$\n$\\gamma \\ln(1/f) = K$\n\nSince $K$ is a constant, the product $\\gamma \\ln(1/f)$ must be the same for both conditions:\n$\\gamma_1 \\ln(1/f_1) = \\gamma_2 \\ln(1/f_2)$\n\n**5. Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma_2$)**\n\n*   Plug in the known values:\n    *   $\\gamma_1 = 20$\n    *   $f_1 = 1/3 \\implies 1/f_1 = 3$\n    *   $f_2 = 2/3 \\implies 1/f_2 = 3/2$\n\n*   The equation becomes:\n    $20 \\times \\ln(3) = \\gamma_2 \\times \\ln(3/2)$\n\n*   Rearrange to solve for $\\gamma_2$:\n    $\\gamma_2 = 20 \\times \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(3/2)}$\n\n*   Now, we can calculate the numerical value. The radius of the detector ($R=30$ m) is not needed for this calculation, as it's part of the constant $K$ that is eliminated by forming a ratio.\n\nTo get a precise value, let's use a short Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem\ngamma_1 = 20\nf_1 = 1/3\nf_2 = 2/3\n\n# From the derived relationship: gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(1/f_1) / ln(1/f_2)\n# 1/f_1 = 3\n# 1/f_2 = 3/2 = 1.5\n\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_code>\n54.19033201859075\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculation gives $\\gamma_2 \\approx 54.19$.\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 28\nB) 40\nC) 54\nD) 68\n\nThe closest option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem relates the fraction of surviving particles to their Lorentz factor. Let's break down the physics and derive the relationship.\n\n**1. Physics Background**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** The number of particles, N, that survive after a time t in their own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law: $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau_0}$, where $N_0$ is the initial number of particles and $\\tau_0$ is the proper mean lifetime.\n*   **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory (the detector), the lifetime of a fast-moving particle is dilated. The lab-frame lifetime, $\\tau_{lab}$, is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$: $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Travel Time:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, meaning their speed $v$ is very close to the speed of light, $c$. The time it takes for a particle to travel the detector radius, $R$, in the lab frame is $t_{lab} \\approx R/c$.\n\n**2. Deriving the Formula**\n\nThe fraction of particles, $f$, that survive the journey to the detector wall is given by the decay law using the time and lifetime measured in the lab frame:\n$f = \\frac{N}{N_0} = e^{-t_{lab}/\\tau_{lab}}$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $t_{lab}$ and $\\tau_{lab}$:\n$f = e^{-(R/c) / (\\gamma \\tau_0)} = e^{-R / (c \\gamma \\tau_0)}$\n\nTo simplify, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(f) = -\\frac{R}{c \\gamma \\tau_0}$\n\nRearranging the equation gives:\n$\\gamma \\ln(f) = -\\frac{R}{c \\tau_0}$\n\nSince $R$, $c$, and $\\tau_0$ are constants for this experiment, the entire right side is a constant. This means the product $\\gamma \\ln(f)$ is constant. We can also write this as $\\gamma \\ln(1/f)$ being constant.\n\n**3. Applying the Conditions**\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n*   **Condition 1:** $\\gamma_1 = 20$, $f_1 = 1/3$\n*   **Condition 2:** $\\gamma_2 = ?$, $f_2 = 2/3$\n\nSince the product $\\gamma \\ln(1/f)$ is constant, we can set the values from both conditions equal to each other:\n$\\gamma_1 \\ln(1/f_1) = \\gamma_2 \\ln(1/f_2)$\n\n**4. Solving for the Unknown Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma_2$)**\n\nNow, we plug in the known values and solve for $\\gamma_2$:\n$20 \\times \\ln(1 / (1/3)) = \\gamma_2 \\times \\ln(1 / (2/3))$\n$20 \\times \\ln(3) = \\gamma_2 \\times \\ln(3/2)$\n\n$\\gamma_2 = 20 \\times \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(3/2)}$\n\nUsing the output from the code interpreter:\n$\\gamma_2 \\approx 54.19$\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
