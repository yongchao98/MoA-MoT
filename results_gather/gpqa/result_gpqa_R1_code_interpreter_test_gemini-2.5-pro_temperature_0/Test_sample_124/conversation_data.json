    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Quantum System**\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three dimensions.\n\n**2. Determine the Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separating variables in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. The total energy is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators:\n$E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nTherefore, the total energy for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy formula simplifies to:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n**3. Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State**\n\nThe energy levels are determined by the value of the principal quantum number $n$.\n*   **Ground State:** $n=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** $n=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** $n=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** $n=3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**4. Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. The formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the $n$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nTo verify this, we can list the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) --- (3 states)\n*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) --- (6 states)\n*   The combination (1, 1, 1) --- (1 state)\n\nTotal number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy eigenvalue is equal to the degeneracy of that energy level.\n\nTo be certain about the calculation, we can use a simple Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef degeneracy_3d_ho(n):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the degeneracy of the n-th energy level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n  The formula is g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2.\n  \"\"\"\n  return (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 2\n\ndef find_combinations(n):\n  \"\"\"\n  Finds all non-negative integer combinations (nx, ny, nz) that sum to n.\n  \"\"\"\n  count = 0\n  for nx in range(n + 1):\n    for ny in range(n - nx + 1):\n      nz = n - nx - ny\n      if nz >= 0:\n        count += 1\n  return count\n\n# The third excited state corresponds to n=3\nn = 3\n\n# Calculate degeneracy using the formula\ng_n_formula = degeneracy_3d_ho(n)\n\n# Calculate degeneracy by counting combinations\ng_n_counting = find_combinations(n)\n\nprint(f\"For the third excited state (n={n}):\")\nprint(f\"Energy is (n + 3/2)hbar*omega = ({n} + 3/2)hbar*omega = {n + 1.5}*hbar*omega\")\nprint(f\"Degeneracy (number of eigenfunctions) calculated by formula: {g_n_formula}\")\nprint(f\"Degeneracy (number of eigenfunctions) calculated by counting: {g_n_counting}\")\n```\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe energy of the third excited state ($n=3$) is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\nThe degeneracy, which is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy, is 10.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\nB) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\nC) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nD) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the energy and degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) of the third excited state of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$.\n\n**1. Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be separated into three independent 1D harmonic oscillators in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. The total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies of these three oscillators:\n$E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by the formula $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nSumming the energies for the three dimensions, we get the total energy for the 3D system:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nWe can define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n$ can be any non-negative integer ($n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$). The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nNow, we identify the energy levels:\n*   **Ground State (lowest energy):** $n=0$. $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** $n=1$. $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** $n=2$. $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** $n=3$. $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**2. Degeneracy**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that correspond to the same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3 ($n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$).\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the $n$-th energy level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nAlternatively, we can list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states\n*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states\n*   The combination (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) — 1 state\n\nTotal number of states = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy eigenvalue is equal to its degeneracy. Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
