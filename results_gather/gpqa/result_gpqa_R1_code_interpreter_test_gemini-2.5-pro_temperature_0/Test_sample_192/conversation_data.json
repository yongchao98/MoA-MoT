    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks how the number of stars per unit range of distance, which we can denote as `dN/dr`, depends on the distance `r`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:** We are told that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\".\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is a continuous variable. When a quantity (number of stars) is said to vary with a continuous variable, it usually refers to the density or distribution of that quantity with respect to the variable.\n    *   A common way to represent this is with a histogram, where the number of stars in a small bin of parallax `Δplx` is plotted against `plx`. The statement describes the shape of this histogram.\n    *   Therefore, the most direct interpretation is that the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    *   So, we have the relation: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:** Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance. For a distance `r` in parsecs and parallax `plx` in arcseconds, the relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Formulate the Transformation:** We have a distribution in terms of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) and we want to find the distribution in terms of distance (`dN/dr`). This requires a change of variables for the distribution function. The general rule for changing variables in a density function is:\n    `p(y) = p(x) * |dx/dy|`\n    In our case, `y = r`, `x = plx`, `p(y) = dN/dr`, and `p(x) = dN/d(plx)`. So the formula is:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    The absolute value is necessary because the number of stars in a given region must be positive, and the derivative `d(plx)/dr` will be negative.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Jacobian:** We need to find the derivative of `plx` with respect to `r`.\n    `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    The absolute value of this derivative (which is called the Jacobian of the transformation) is:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = |-1/r²| = 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Perform the Substitution:** Now we substitute the expressions for `dN/d(plx)` and `|d(plx)/dr|` into our transformation formula:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express in Terms of `r`:** The final step is to express the entire relationship in terms of `r` by substituting `plx = 1/r`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n**Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the cube of the distance (`r³`). This corresponds to option D.\n\nAlternative Interpretation Check:\nIf one were to interpret \"number of stars\" as a cumulative count, specifically the number of stars with parallax greater than `plx` (`N(>plx)`), which corresponds to stars closer than distance `r` (`N(<r)`), the reasoning would be:\n`N(>plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n`N(<r) ∝ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5`\n`dN/dr = d(N(<r))/dr ∝ d(r^5)/dr = 5r^4 ∝ r^4`\nThis would lead to option C. However, as argued in step 2, interpreting the given information as a density function (`dN/d(plx)`) is the more direct and standard reading of the phrasing in a physics or mathematics context.\n\nFinal Answer is based on the primary, more direct interpretation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
