    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactions and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** Both reactions produce a substituted lactone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. A lactone is a cyclic ester. \"Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" indicates a 6-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (position 1) and a carbonyl group (position 2). This is a delta-lactone. The ethyl group is at position 4, which is the chiral center.\n    *   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **Starting Materials:** The options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name and draw the structure. It is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n    *   Structure: `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   This molecule has two different functional groups: an ester and a carboxylic acid.\n    *   It has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), the one bearing the ethyl group.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reducing Agents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **Reaction 2 with Borane (BH₃):**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is well-known for selectively reducing carboxylic acids (`-COOH`) to primary alcohols (`-CH₂OH`) much faster than it reduces esters (`-COOR`).\n    *   **Pathway:**\n        1.  `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with BH₃. The `-COOH` group is reduced to `-CH₂OH`. The ester group is unaffected.\n        2.  The intermediate formed is `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n        3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (`-OH`) attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBu-OH`) and forming the 6-membered lactone ring.\n\n*   **Reaction 1 with Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH₄ and can reduce esters. While it also reduces carboxylic acids, it is generally faster with esters. The problem's design implies a selective reduction. Given that BH₃ targets the acid, LiBH₄ must be intended to target the ester.\n    *   **Pathway:**\n        1.  `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with LiBH₄. The ester group (`-COOiBu`) is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n        2.  The intermediate formed is `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid).\n        3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group (`-OH`) attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl to form the lactone.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe stereochemistry of the product depends on how the groups attached to the chiral center in the starting material are transformed. We need to apply the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Starting Material (`iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`):**\n    The chiral center is C3. The four attached groups are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` (Highest priority, let's call it **P1**)\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Second priority, **P2**)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group, Third priority, **P3**)\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest priority, **P4**)\n    *Reasoning for P1 > P2:* The chains are identical until the final part of the functional group: `-O-iBu` vs `-OH`. Comparing the atoms attached to the oxygen, Carbon (in isobutyl) has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Product (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one):**\n    The chiral center is C4. The four attached groups are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (ring fragment towards the carbonyl, Highest priority, **P'1**)\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (ring fragment towards the ring oxygen, Second priority, **P'2**)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group, Third priority, **P'3**)\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest priority, **P'4**)\n    *Reasoning for P'1 > P'2:* Comparing the ring fragments atom by atom from the chiral center, the first point of difference is at the second carbon away: a carbonyl carbon (`=O`) in P'1 versus a methylene carbon (`-CH₂-`) in P'2. The carbonyl carbon is considered to be bonded to more oxygen atoms, giving it higher priority.\n\n### **4. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n\nNow, let's trace how the groups and their priorities change in each reaction.\n\n*   **Reaction 2 (B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone):**\n    *   The `-COOH` group (**P2**) is reduced to `-CH₂OH`, which becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` part of the lactone (**P'2**).\n    *   The `-COOiBu` group (**P1**) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` part of the lactone (**P'1**).\n    *   So, **P1 → P'1** and **P2 → P'2**. The priority order of the groups is preserved.\n    *   This means the reaction proceeds with **retention** of configuration.\n    *   Since the product is **(S)**, the starting material B must also be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Reaction 1 (A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone):**\n    *   The `-COOiBu` group (**P1**) is reduced to `-CH₂OH`, which becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` part of the lactone (**P'2**).\n    *   The `-COOH` group (**P2**) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` part of the lactone (**P'1**).\n    *   So, **P1 → P'2** and **P2 → P'1**. The priorities of the top two groups are swapped.\n    *   Swapping the priorities of two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of configuration.\n    *   Since the product is **(R)**, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\n*   For Reaction 1, starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   For Reaction 2, starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth A and B are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
