    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (N-H stretching) is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). One band corresponds to the asymmetric stretch and the other to the symmetric stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (2+1=3), which is a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   This is the -CH₃ part of an ethyl group.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (3+1=4), which is a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a significantly downfield shift for a -CH₂- group. This high value is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom that is part of an ester (-C(=O)-O-**CH₂**-).\n    *   Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)** attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester fragment.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of amine protons (-NH₂), which often appear broad due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar broadening from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the primary amine found in the IR data.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Indicates four protons on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield), meaning they are adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded (further upfield), meaning they are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating group (the amine, -NH₂).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data. It has the correct formula (C9H11NO2), a primary amine, a conjugated ester, an ethoxy group, and a para-substituted aromatic ring with the expected chemical shifts.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, not an ester. The C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹). The aromatic region would show a more complex pattern for meta-substitution, not two doublets.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. The NMR would show a formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8 ppm and an N-H proton, not an -NH₂ signal.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The ester group is -O-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl at a much lower chemical shift (~2.2-2.6 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct structure.\n\n<<<A>>>"
