    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Observability Criteria**\n\nA star can be observed by a spectrograph at a specific observatory if it meets two main criteria:\n*   **Positional Criterion (Visibility):** The star must rise above the horizon at the observatory's location. This depends on the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n*   **Brightness Criterion (Magnitude Limit):** The star must be bright enough for the instrument to detect. This is determined by its apparent V magnitude.\n\n**2. Define the Specific Criteria for Each Observatory**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory:**\n    *   **Location:** Paranal Observatory is in Chile, at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. We'll use `latitude = -24.6°`.\n    *   **Visibility:** A star with declination `δ` is visible from a southern hemisphere observatory (latitude `φ`) if `δ < 90° + φ`.\n        *   `DEC < 90° - 24.6°`\n        *   `DEC < +65.4°`\n    *   **Magnitude Limit:** Apparent V magnitude `V < 17.0` mag.\n\n*   **HIRES at Keck Observatory:**\n    *   **Location:** Keck Observatory is on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, at a latitude of approximately 19.8° North. We'll use `latitude = +19.8°`.\n    *   **Visibility:** A star with declination `δ` is visible from a northern hemisphere observatory (latitude `φ`) if `δ > φ - 90°`.\n        *   `DEC > 19.8° - 90°`\n        *   `DEC > -70.2°`\n    *   **Magnitude Limit:** Apparent V magnitude `V < 16.0` mag.\n\n**3. Combine the Criteria for Joint Observation**\n\nFor a star to be detected by **both** observatories, it must satisfy the strictest conditions from each category:\n*   **Combined Visibility:** The star's declination must be within the range visible to both.\n    *   `-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°`\n*   **Combined Magnitude Limit:** The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the stricter limit.\n    *   `V < 16.0` mag (the limit for HIRES).\n\n**4. Analyze Each Star**\n\nWe will now check each star against these two combined criteria. We'll use the following formulas to calculate the apparent magnitude (V) when needed:\n*   Distance Modulus: `V = Mv + 5 * log10(d) - 5`, where `Mv` is the absolute V magnitude and `d` is the distance in parsecs.\n*   Interstellar Extinction: `V_observed = V_intrinsic + A_V`, where `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\nI will use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef check_star(name, ra, dec, Mv=None, V=None, d=None, e_bv=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a star is observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The name of the star.\n        ra (str): Right Ascension.\n        dec (float): Declination in degrees.\n        Mv (float, optional): Absolute V magnitude.\n        V (float, optional): Apparent V magnitude.\n        d (float, optional): Distance in parsecs.\n        e_bv (float, optional): Color excess E(B-V).\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if observable by both, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Combined criteria\n    MIN_DEC = -70.2  # From Keck\n    MAX_DEC = 65.4   # From Paranal\n    MAX_V_MAG = 16.0 # From HIRES\n\n    # 1.

    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we need to check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Positional Visibility:** The star's declination (DEC) must be within the observable range of both observatories.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the magnitude limit of *both* instruments.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Combined Observability Criteria**\n\n*   **Positional Visibility:**\n    *   Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO) is in the Southern Hemisphere (Latitude ≈ -24.6°). It can observe stars with declinations roughly between -90° and +65.4° (`DEC < 90° - 24.6°`).\n    *   Keck Observatory (HIRES) is in the Northern Hemisphere (Latitude ≈ +19.8°). It can observe stars with declinations roughly between -70.2° and +90° (`DEC > 19.8° - 90°`).\n    *   For a star to be visible from **both**, its declination must be in the overlapping range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n*   **Brightness Limit:**\n    *   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude `V < 17.0`.\n    *   HIRES can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude `V < 16.0`.\n    *   For a star to be detected by **both**, it must be brighter than the stricter limit: **V < 16.0**.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Each Star Against the Combined Criteria**\n\nWe will use the following formula to calculate the apparent magnitude (V) from the absolute magnitude (Mv), distance (d), and extinction (Aᵥ):\n`V = Mv + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + Aᵥ`\nwhere `Aᵥ = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\nThe Python code executed the following checks:\n\n*   **Star1:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the required range of [-70.2°, +65.4°] as it is too far south for Keck.\n    *   **Result: Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star2:** DEC = 55° (Observable). Apparent V magnitude = 16.5. This is not brighter than the required `V < 16.0`.\n    *   **Result: Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star3:** DEC = 48° (Observable). Apparent V magnitude = 15.5. This is brighter than the required `V < 16.0`.\n    *   **Result: Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star4:** DEC = -48° (Observable). We must calculate its apparent magnitude.\n    *   `Aᵥ = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24`\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74`\n    *   This magnitude (16.74) is not brighter than the required `V < 16.0`.\n    *   **Result: Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star5:** DEC = 60° (Observable). We must calculate its apparent magnitude.\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 3.49 - 5 = 14.99`\n    *   This magnitude (14.99) is brighter than the required `V < 16.0`.\n    *   **Result: Observable by both.**\n\nBased on this analysis, only Star3 and Star5 meet both the positional and brightness criteria for joint observation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
