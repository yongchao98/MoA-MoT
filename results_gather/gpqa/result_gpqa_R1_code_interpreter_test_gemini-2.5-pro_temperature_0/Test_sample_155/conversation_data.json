    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks the protonated epoxide in an *anti*-fashion (from the side opposite the epoxide C-O bond).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-opening) results in the net *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. The two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, and they are anti to each other.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-known stereochemical rule for addition reactions: **T**rans-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition → **M**eso compound.\n    *   Let's verify this: The *trans*-alkene reacts via *syn*-epoxidation to form a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   The subsequent *anti*-attack of water on either enantiomer of the epoxide leads to the same single product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This product has two chiral centers but possesses a center of inversion, making it a meso compound (an achiral molecule).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One single compound, the meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for this case is: **C**is-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition → **R**acemic mixture.\n    *   Let's verify this: The *cis*-alkene reacts via *syn*-epoxidation to form the *meso*-epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   The subsequent *anti*-attack of water on this achiral meso-epoxide can occur at either of the two equivalent carbons (C4 or C5). Attack at one carbon produces the (4R,5R)-diol, and attack at the other produces the (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   Since the starting materials and reagents are all achiral, the chiral products must be formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-(4R,5S) diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) diol and the (4S,5S) diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. The meso diol will have a different polarity than the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them. It will elute as a distinct peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved racemic pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own **single peak**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will separate all three stereoisomers, resulting in **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
