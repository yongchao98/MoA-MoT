    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula, also known as Einstein's velocity addition formula.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   Let `S` be the stationary laboratory frame where the observer is located.\n    *   Let `S'` be the moving frame, which is the rest frame of the glass.\n\n2.  **Identify the velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the moving frame `S'` (the glass) relative to the stationary frame `S` is `v`. The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   The velocity of the light beam as measured in its own medium (the glass), i.e., in the `S'` frame, is `u'`. The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). So, `n = c / u'`, which gives `u' = c / n`.\n    *   The problem specifies that we should take the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass, is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities in the same direction in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) as seen by the observer in the stationary frame `S`.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object as seen in the moving frame `S'`.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame `S'` relative to the stationary frame `S`.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    We have `u' = 1/n`, `v = v`, and `c = 1`. Substituting these into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n    To simplify this complex fraction, we can find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator.\n    Numerator: `1/n + v = 1/n + vn/n = (1 + vn) / n`\n    Denominator: `1 + v/n = n/n + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n    Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n    `u = ( (1 + vn) / n ) / ( (n + v) / n )`\n    We can cancel the `n` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator:\n    `u = (1 + vn) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    This matches option A.\n\nA) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nB) 1\nC) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nD) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
