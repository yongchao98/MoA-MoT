    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State and Hamiltonian\n\n*   **Particle and Magnetic Moment:** We have a spin-1/2 particle. Its magnetic moment `μ` is related to its spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component is `μ_z = γS_z`.\n*   **Initial Condition (t < 0):** The particle is in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_z B`.\n*   **Initial State:** The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the eigenstates of `S_z`: spin-up `|+z⟩` (with energy `E_up = -γ(ħ/2)B`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (with energy `E_down = +γ(ħ/2)B`). The lowest energy state is `|+z⟩`. Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\n*   **New Condition (t ≥ 0):** The magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_y B`.\n*   **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle for `t > 0` will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian `H`. The state at time `t` is given by `|ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`.\n\n### 3. Analyze the System in the New Energy Basis\n\nTo understand the time evolution, it's best to work in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian `H`. Since `H` is proportional to `S_y`, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`.\n\n*   **Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of `S_y`:** The operator `S_y` has two eigenstates, which we'll call `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`, with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively.\n*   **Energy Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of `H`:**\n    *   The state `|+y⟩` is an eigenstate of `H` with energy `E_+ = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`.\n    *   The state `|-y⟩` is an eigenstate of `H` with energy `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`.\n\n### 4. Express the Initial State in the New Basis\n\nWe need to write the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩` as a linear combination (superposition) of the new energy eigenstates `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`.\nThe relationship between the z-basis and y-basis eigenstates is:\n*   `|+y⟩ = (1/√2) (|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩)`\n*   `|-y⟩ = (1/√2) (|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩)`\n\nBy inverting these, we find:\n*   `|+z⟩ = (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)`\n\nSo, our initial state is an equal superposition of the two new energy eigenstates.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Time-Evolved State\n\nNow we can apply the time evolution operator to the initial state expressed in the new basis:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ) [ (1/√2) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) |-y⟩ ]`\nSince `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩` are energy eigenstates, the evolution is simple:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) e^(-iE_+t/ħ) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) e^(-iE_-t/ħ) |-y⟩`\n\nSubstitute the energy values `E_+ = -γBħ/2` and `E_- = +γBħ/2`:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) e^(-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) e^(-i(γBħ/2)t/ħ) |-y⟩`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) e^(iγBt/2) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) e^(-iγBt/2) |-y⟩`\n\n### 6. Calculate the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\n\nWe want to find the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is the expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\nLet's calculate `⟨S_z(t)⟩`. We need the matrix elements of `S_z` in the y-basis. It can be shown that:\n*   `⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ = 0`\n*   `⟨-y| S_z |-y⟩ = 0`\n*   `⟨+y| S_z |-y⟩ = ħ/2`\n*   `⟨-y| S_z |+y⟩ = ħ/2`\n\nNow, we compute `⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = [ (1/√2) e^(-iγBt/2) ⟨+y| + (1/√2) e^(iγBt/2) ⟨-y| ] S_z [ (1/√2) e^(iγBt/2) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) e^(-iγBt/2) |-y⟩ ]`\n\nExpanding this gives four terms. The two terms with `⟨+y|S_z|+y⟩` and `⟨-y|S_z|-y⟩` are zero. The two non-zero cross-terms are:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (1/2) e^(-iγBt/2) e^(-iγBt/2) ⟨+y|S_z|-y⟩ + (1/2) e^(iγBt/2) e^(iγBt/2) ⟨-y|S_z|+y⟩`\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (1/2) e^(-iγBt) (ħ/2) + (1/2) e^(iγBt) (ħ/2)`\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/4) [ e^(iγBt) + e^(-iγBt) ]`\n\nUsing Euler's formula, `cos(θ) = (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ))/2`, we get:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/4) [ 2 cos(γBt) ] = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\n### 7. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\nThis expression describes an oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is `A cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency. By comparing this to our result, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is:\n`ω = γB`\n\nThis is the Larmor frequency, which describes the precession of the spin's expectation value around the new magnetic field.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, which corresponds to `ω`.\n\nFinal Answer is `γB`.\n\nLet's check this with a simple python script using the matrix formalism. We can set `ħ=1`, `γ=1`, `B=1` for simplicity. The frequency `ω` should then be 1.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set constants to 1 for simplicity\nhbar = 1.0\ngamma = 1.0\nB = 1.0\n\n# Pauli matrices\nsigma_x = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]], dtype=complex)\nsigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j], [1j, 0]], dtype=complex)\nsigma_z = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]], dtype=complex)\n\n# Spin operators\nSx = (hbar/2) * sigma_x\nSy = (hbar/2) * sigma_y\nSz = (hbar/2) * sigma_z\n\n# Initial state |+z>\npsi_0 = np.array([[1], [0]], dtype=complex)\n\n# New Hamiltonian H = -gamma * B * Sy\nH = -gamma * B * Sy\n\n# Time evolution operator U(t) = exp(-iHt/hbar)\n# We can use scipy.linalg.expm for matrix exponential\nfrom scipy.linalg import expm\n\n# Let's calculate the expectation value of Sz at a few time points\n# <Sz(t)> = <psi_0| U(t)^dagger Sz U(t) |psi_0>\n# This is the Heisenberg picture approach, which is equivalent.\n# Let's use the Schrodinger picture: |psi(t)> = U(t)|psi_0>\n# <Sz(t)> = <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>\n\n# The oscillation is cos(gamma*B*t).

    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Hamiltonian\n\n*   **Initial Situation (t < 0):** A spin-1/2 particle is in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_z B`, where `μ = γS` is the magnetic moment and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   **Initial State:** The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the spin-up `|+z⟩` and spin-down `|-z⟩` states. The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γ(ħ/2)B` and `E_down = +γ(ħ/2)B`. The lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z⟩`.\n*   Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2. New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\n*   **New Situation (t ≥ 0):** The magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_y B`.\n*   **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle for `t > 0` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`.\n\n### 3. Solving the Time Evolution\n\nTo find `|ψ(t)⟩`, it is most convenient to express the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩` in the basis of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H`. Since `H` is proportional to the spin operator `S_y`, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which we denote as `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`.\n\n*   **Eigenstates of S_y:**\n    *   `|+y⟩` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`.\n    *   `|-y⟩` with eigenvalue `-ħ/2`.\n*   **Energy Eigenstates of H:**\n    *   For `|+y⟩`, the energy is `E_+ = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`.\n    *   For `|-y⟩`, the energy is `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`.\n\nNext, we express the initial state `|+z⟩` in terms of `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`. The standard relations are:\n`|+z⟩ = (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)`\n`|-z⟩ = (-i/√2) (|+y⟩ - |-y⟩)`\n\nSo, the initial state is:\n`|ψ(0)⟩ = (1/√2) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) |-y⟩`\n\nNow, we apply the time evolution operator. Since `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩` are energy eigenstates, the evolution is simple:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩ = (1/√2) e^(-iE_+t/ħ) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) e^(-iE_-t/ħ) |-y⟩`\n\nSubstituting the energy eigenvalues:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) e^(-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) e^(-i(γBħ/2)t/ħ) |-y⟩`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) |+y⟩ + e^(-iγBt/2) |-y⟩ ]`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value\n\nWe want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩`. We need to calculate `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\nTo do this, we need to know how `S_z` acts on the `y`-basis states:\n`S_z |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) |-y⟩`\n`S_z |-y⟩ = (ħ/2) |+y⟩`\n\nNow we can compute the expectation value:\n`S_z |ψ(t)⟩ = S_z (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) |+y⟩ + e^(-iγBt/2) |-y⟩ ]`\n`= (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) S_z|+y⟩ + e^(-iγBt/2) S_z|-y⟩ ]`\n`= (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) (ħ/2)|-y⟩ + e^(-iγBt/2) (ħ/2)|+y⟩ ]`\n`= (ħ/(2√2)) [ e^(-iγBt/2) |+y⟩ + e^(iγBt/2) |-y⟩ ]`\n\nNow, we take the inner product with `⟨ψ(t)|`:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`\n`⟨ψ(t)| = (1/√2) [ e^(-iγBt/2) ⟨+y| + e^(iγBt/2) ⟨-y| ]`\n\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ e^(-iγBt/2) ⟨+y| + e^(iγBt/2) ⟨-y| ] ⋅ (ħ/(2√2)) [ e^(-iγBt/2) |+y⟩ + e^(iγBt/2) |-y⟩ ]`\n\nUsing the orthogonality of the basis (`⟨+y|+y⟩ = 1`, `⟨-y|-y⟩ = 1`, `⟨+y|-y⟩ = 0`), we get:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/4) [ e^(-iγBt/2)e^(-iγBt/2) + e^(iγBt/2)e^(iγBt/2) ]`\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/4) [ e^(-iγBt) + e^(iγBt) ]`\n\nUsing Euler's formula, `cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2`, we find:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/4) [ 2 cos(γBt) ] = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\n### 5. Determining the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\nThis is a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is `A cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency. By comparing this to our result, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation as:\n`ω = γB`\n\nThis frequency is known as the Larmor frequency, which describes the precession of the spin expectation vector around the magnetic field.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
