The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out in the ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_1}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This means we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) by:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    The maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, K:\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n\n6.  **Connect RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_*$), and the semi-major axis ($a$). The detection by the transit method implies an orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula, assuming $M_p \\ll M_*$, is:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} v_{p,orb}$\n    where $v_{p,orb}$ is the planet's orbital velocity, given by $v_{p,orb} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n    Substituting $v_{p,orb}$ into the equation for K:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_* a}}$\n\n7.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    $K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_* a}$\n    $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{K^2 M_*}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G M_2^2}{K_2^2 M_*}}{\\frac{G M_1^2}{K_1^2 M_*}}$\n    The terms G and $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2}{K_2^2} \\times \\frac{K_1^2}{M_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n9.  **Express the Ratio in Terms of Doppler Shifts:** We know that $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_0}}{c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_0}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n    Substituting this into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{M_2}{M_1} \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n11. **Plug in the Given Values:**\n    *   $M_1 = 7 M_{Earth}$\n    *   $M_2 = 5 M_{Earth}$\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n12. **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option C.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, the following Python code is executed.\n```python\n# Given values\n# Planet 1\nM1_earth_mass = 7.0\ndelta_lambda1_A = 0.03  # in Angstroms\n\n# Planet 2\nM2_earth_mass = 5.0\ndelta_lambda2_A = 0.04  # in Angstroms\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is derived as:\n# T_ratio = (M2 / M1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\n\n# Calculate the ratio of masses (M2 / M1)\nmass_ratio = M2_earth_mass / M1_earth_mass\n\n# Calculate the ratio of Doppler shifts (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\ndoppler_shift_ratio = delta_lambda1_A / delta_lambda2_A\n\n# Calculate the final temperature ratio\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * doppler_shift_ratio\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\nThe code output confirms that the calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357.
