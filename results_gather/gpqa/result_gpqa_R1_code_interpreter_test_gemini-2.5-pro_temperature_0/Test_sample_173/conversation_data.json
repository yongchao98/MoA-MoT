    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Given Relations:**\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2` (Fragment 1 is the more massive one).\n    *   `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M` (The sum of fragment rest-masses).\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe can express the mass relations in terms of rest-mass energy.\n1.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n2.  `(m1 + m2)*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2` => `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow, we solve this system of two equations:\n*   Substitute (1) into (2): `(2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n*   `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nThen, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nSo, the rest-mass energies are `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe Q-value of the fission is the energy released, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. It's the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = (Initial Rest Energy) - (Final Rest Energy)`\n*   `Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation (T1_classical)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = (1/2)mv^2` and momentum is `p = mv`. This leads to `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, we can relate their kinetic energies:\n    *   `T1_cl / T2_cl = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   We know `m1 = 2*m2`, so `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   `T1_cl / T2_cl = 1/2` => `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`\n*   Now use the total kinetic energy:\n    *   `T1_cl + T2_cl = Q = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_cl + 2 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_cl = 1 GeV`\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Total energy is conserved. The initial total energy is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. The final total energy is `E1 + E2`.\n    *   `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n*   Momentum is also conserved, so `|p1| = |p2|`, which means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n    *   `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n*   Rearrange this to `E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n*   Factor the terms: `(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2 - m2*c^2)(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n*   Substitute the known values:\n    *   `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n    *   `(E1 - E2) * 300 = (198 - 99) * (198 + 99)`\n    *   `(E1 - E2) * 300 = 99 * 297 = 29403`\n    *   `E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Now we have a new system of two linear equations for `E1` and `E2`:\n    1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n    2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Add the two equations to solve for `E1`:\n    *   `2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n    *   `E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n*   The kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n    *   `T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 and convert it to MeV.\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_cl = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`, the difference is:\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of the arithmetic, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Given values in GeV\nM_c2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate fragment rest-mass energies\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# m1 = 2 * m2\n# => 3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\nm2_c2 = 0.99 * M_c2 / 3.0\nm1_c2 = 2.0 * m2_c2\n\n# Calculate Q-value (total kinetic energy)\nQ_value = M_c2 - (m1_c2 + m2_c2)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation for T1 ---\n# T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = 1/2\n# T1_cl + T2_cl = Q_value\n# T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = Q_value\nT1_classical = Q_value / 3.0\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation for T1 ---\n# E1 + E2 = M_c2\n# (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1_c2)^2 - (m2_c2)^2\nE1_minus_E2 = (m1_c2**2 - m2_c2**2) / M_c2\n# 2*E1 = M_c2 + E1_minus_E2\nE1 = (M_c2 + E1_minus_E2) / 2.0\n# T1 = E1 - m1_c2\nT1_relativistic = E1 - m1_c2\n\n# --- Calculate the difference in MeV ---\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n```\nRelativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\nClassical T1: 1.000 GeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus at rest.\n    *   Rest-mass energy: `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Fragment 1 is the more massive one: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe can work with rest-mass energies directly.\n1.  From `m1 = 2 * m2`, we get `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n2.  From `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, we get `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`.\n    *   `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow we solve the system of two equations:\n*   Substitute (1) into (2): `(2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n*   `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n\nNow find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n*   `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nSo, the rest-mass energies of the fragments are `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial Rest Energy) - (Final Rest Energy)`\n*   `Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero. The two fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n    *   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n    *   Dividing the two equations gives: `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1`.\n*   **Solve for T1_classical:**\n    *   We know `m1 = 2*m2`, so `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   `T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2`  => `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    *   We also know the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Substitute `T2_classical`: `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1**\n\nIn special relativity, we must use the full energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + m*c^2`).\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved.\n    *   Initial total energy = `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Final total energy = `E1 + E2`.\n    *   Therefore, `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Relativistic momentum is also conserved, so `|p1| = |p2| = p`. This means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   From the energy-momentum relation, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Equating the momenta: `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n*   **Solve for E1:**\n    *   Rearrange the equation: `E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n    *   Factor the terms: `(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2 - m2*c^2)(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n    *   Substitute the known values:\n        *   `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n        *   `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`\n        *   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n    *   `(E1 - E2) * (300) = (198 - 99) * (198 + 99)`\n    *   `(E1 - E2) * 300 = (99) * (297)`\n    *   `E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`.\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for `E1` and `E2`:\n    1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n    2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Add the two equations to eliminate `E2`:\n    *   `2 * E1 = 300 + 98.01 = 398.01 GeV`.\n    *   `E1 = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   The kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n    *   `T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) `T1` and the classical `T1`, and express it in MeV.\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Convert to MeV (since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`):\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation.\n```python\n# Given values in GeV\nM_c2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate fragment rest-mass energies\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# m1 = 2 * m2\n# => 3 * m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2\nm2_c2 = 0.99 * M_c2 / 3.0\nm1_c2 = 2.0 * m2_c2\n\n# Calculate Q-value (total kinetic energy)\nQ_value = M_c2 - (m1_c2 + m2_c2)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation for T1 ---\n# From conservation of momentum, T1_cl/T2_cl = m2/m1 = 1/2\n# T1_cl + T2_cl = Q_value\n# T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = Q_value\nT1_classical = Q_value / 3.0\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation for T1 ---\n# Conservation of energy: E1 + E2 = M_c2\n# Conservation of momentum: E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n# (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\nE1_minus_E2 = (m1_c2**2 - m2_c2**2) / M_c2\n# We have a system of two equations:\n# E1 + E2 = M_c2\n# E1 - E2 = E1_minus_E2\n# Adding them gives: 2*E1 = M_c2 + E1_minus_E2\nE1 = (M_c2 + E1_minus_E2) / 2.0\n# The kinetic energy is T1 = E1 - m1*c^2\nT1_relativistic = E1 - m1_c2\n\n# --- Calculate the difference in MeV ---\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"The difference is {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV.\")\n```\nThe difference is 5.0 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>",
