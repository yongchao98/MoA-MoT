    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Geometry of the Aperture:**\n    The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where the apothem (the perpendicular distance from the center to a side) is 'a'. As the number of sides N approaches infinity (`N -> ∞`), a regular polygon becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle. So, the aperture is a circular hole of radius `a`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Phenomenon:**\n    The problem involves monochromatic light of wavelength `λ` passing through an aperture and forming a pattern in the far field. This is a classic case of Fraunhofer diffraction. The diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Condition for Minima in an Airy Pattern:**\n    The intensity `I` of the Airy pattern at an angle `θ` from the central axis is given by `I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`, where:\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n    *   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n\n    The intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sin(θ))` is zero, while the denominator is non-zero. Let `x = k * a * sin(θ)`. The minima correspond to the non-zero roots of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\n4.  **Positions of the Minima:**\n    The angular positions `θ_m` of the minima are given by the condition:\n    `k * a * sin(θ_m) = x_m`\n    where `x_m` is the m-th non-zero root of `J₁(x)`.\n    Substituting `k = 2π / λ`, we get:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ_m) = x_m`\n    `sin(θ_m) = (x_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n    The problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation (`tan θ ≈ θ`, which also implies `sin θ ≈ θ` for small angles). So:\n    `θ_m ≈ (x_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n5.  **Interpret the Question:**\n    The question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This phrasing is ambiguous and can be interpreted in two main ways:\n    *   **Interpretation 1:** The distance between the first minimum (m=1) and the second minimum (m=2) on the same side of the central maximum. This distance would be `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    *   **Interpretation 2:** The distance between the two first-order minima, which are located symmetrically on opposite sides of the central maximum (at `+θ₁` and `-θ₁`). This distance is the angular diameter of the central Airy disk and is equal to `Δθ = θ₁ - (-θ₁) = 2θ₁`.\n\n6.  **Evaluate Both Interpretations:**\n    To evaluate these, we need the first two non-zero roots of `J₁(x)`. These are well-known values:\n    *   `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n    *   **Under Interpretation 1 (`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`):**\n        `Δθ = (x₂ * λ) / (2π * a) - (x₁ * λ) / (2π * a) = ((x₂ - x₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n        `Δθ ≈ ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * 3.1416)) * (λ / a)`\n        `Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n        This corresponds to option B) `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n    *   **Under Interpretation 2 (`Δθ = 2θ₁`):**\n        `Δθ = 2 * θ₁ = 2 * (x₁ * λ) / (2π * a) = (x₁ / π) * (λ / a)`\n        `Δθ ≈ (3.8317 / 3.1416) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.2197 * (λ / a)`\n        This is famously approximated as `1.220 * (λ / a)`. This corresponds to option A) `1.220 λ /a`.\n\n7.  **Resolve the Ambiguity:**\n    Both interpretations lead to answers present in the options. We must decide which interpretation is more likely intended.\n    *   The quantity `2θ₁` (the angular width of the central maximum) is a fundamental parameter in optics. It defines the limit of resolution for optical instruments like telescopes and microscopes (the Rayleigh criterion is based on `θ₁`). It is a very common quantity to be tested on.\n    *   The quantity `θ₂ - θ₁` (the spacing between the first and second dark rings) is a more detailed feature of the Airy pattern. Calculating it requires knowing the second zero of the Bessel function (`x₂`), which is a less common piece of information than the first zero (`x₁`).\n    *   In the context of physics problems, a question about the \"distance between the two first-order\" features (like maxima or minima) typically refers to the separation of the symmetric pair (`+m` and `-m`).\n\n    Given the fundamental importance of the angular width of the central maximum in physics, it is highly probable that this is the intended quantity. Therefore, Interpretation 2 is the most likely one.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The angular distance between the two first-order minima is `2θ₁`.\n    `2θ₁ = 1.220 * λ / a`\n    This matches option A.\n\nLet's verify the coefficients using a python script.\n```python\nimport scipy.special as sp\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Get the first two non-zero zeros of the Bessel function J1(x)\nzeros = sp.jn_zeros(1, 2)\nx1 = zeros[0]\nx2 = zeros[1]\n\n# Coefficient for the angular position of the first minimum (theta_1)\n# theta_1 = C1 * (lambda/a)\nC1 = x1 / (2 * np.pi)\n\n# Coefficient for the angular distance between the two first-order minima (2*theta_1)\n# 2*theta_1 = C2 * (lambda/a)\nC2 = x1 / np.pi\n\n# Coefficient for the angular distance between the first and second minima (theta_2 - theta_1)\n# theta_2 - theta_1 = C3 * (lambda/a)\nC3 = (x2 - x1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"Coefficient for 2*theta_1 (Option A): {C2}\")\nprint(f\"Coefficient for theta_2 - theta_1 (Option B): {C3}\")\nprint(f\"Coefficient for theta_1 (Option C): {C1}\")\n```\n>>>\n```\nCoefficient for 2*theta_1 (Option A): 1.219670343416934\nCoefficient for theta_2 - theta_1 (Option B): 0.5067300107932948\nCoefficient for theta_1 (Option C): 0.609835171708467\n```\nThe output of the code confirms that the coefficient for the angular distance between the two first-order minima (`2θ₁`) is approximately 1.220, which corresponds to option A. The coefficient for the distance between the first and second minima (`θ₂ - θ₁`) is approximately 0.507, corresponding to option B. Based on the reasoning that the question is asking for the more fundamental physical quantity, we choose A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` approaches a circle of radius `a` as the number of sides `N` tends to infinity. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe phenomenon described is Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the resulting diffraction pattern is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\nThe angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) are given by the formula:\n`sin(θ_m) = x_m * λ / (2π * a)`\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `x_m` is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function of the first kind, `J₁(x)`.\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The formula becomes:\n`θ_m = (x_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of `J₁(x)`. These are well-known values:\n*   `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe phrase \"angular distance between the first two minima\" can be interpreted in two ways:\n1.  The distance between the first minimum (m=1) and the second minimum (m=2) on the same side of the central maximum. This would be `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n2.  The distance between the two first-order minima, which are located symmetrically on opposite sides of the central maximum (at `+θ₁` and `-θ₁`). This distance is the angular diameter of the central Airy disk and is equal to `Δθ = θ₁ - (-θ₁) = 2θ₁`.\n\nLet's calculate the values for both interpretations:\n\n**Interpretation 1: Distance between the 1st and 2nd dark rings (`θ₂ - θ₁`)**\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (x₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) - (x₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = ((x₂ - x₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * 3.14159)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n**Interpretation 2: Distance between the two first-order minima (`2θ₁`)**\nThis is the angular width of the central bright maximum (the Airy disk).\n`θ₁ = (x₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)`\nThe angular distance between the two first-order minima is:\n`Δθ = 2 * θ₁ ≈ 2 * 0.610 * (λ / a) = 1.220 * (λ / a)`\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nIn physics, the angular width of the central maximum (`2θ₁`) is a much more fundamental and frequently discussed quantity than the spacing between subsequent rings. It is directly related to the resolving power of optical instruments (the Rayleigh criterion is `θ_res = θ₁`). Given that both interpretations lead to one of the options, it is most probable that the question is asking for this fundamental quantity. The phrasing \"distance between the first two minima\" is a common, albeit slightly ambiguous, way to ask for the width of the central peak, defined by the two symmetric first-order minima.\n\nTherefore, we choose the second interpretation. The angular distance is `2θ₁`.\n\n`Δθ = 2θ₁ = (x₁ / π) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / 3.14159) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.2197 * (λ / a)`\n\nRounding to three decimal places, we get `1.220 * λ / a`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
