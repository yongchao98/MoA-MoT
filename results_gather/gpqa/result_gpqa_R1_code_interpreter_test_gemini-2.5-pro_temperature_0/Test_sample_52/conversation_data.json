    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Structural Fragments\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents. The formula for this part of the molecule is -C6H4-.\n*   **1H NMR - Aromatic Region:** \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". A di-substituted benzene ring gives two signals in the aromatic region typically when it is 1,4- (para) substituted, resulting in a symmetrical structure where there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This accounts for 4 hydrogens (4H) and 6 carbons (6C) from the ring. The degree of unsaturation (DBE) for a benzene ring is 4.\n*   **FTIR - Ester Group:** The spectrum shows the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This group contains one carbonyl (C=O), which adds 1 to the DBE. This fragment contains 1 carbon and 2 oxygen atoms.\n*   **1H NMR - Vinyl Region:** \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n    *   The proton H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and further split by the three protons of the adjacent -CH3 group into a quartet. This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   The proton H(a) is only split by H(b), resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   This fragment is a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), which contains 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (C3H5). The C=C double bond adds 1 to the DBE.\n*   **1H NMR - Aliphatic Region:** \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\".\n    *   One -CH3 signal belongs to the propenyl group identified above. This methyl group is adjacent to a vinyl proton, so its signal would be a doublet.\n    *   The second -CH3 signal must come from another part of the molecule.\n*   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that rules out fragments like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), etc. Since the second -CH3 group cannot be part of a larger alkyl chain (due to the \"no -CH2\" rule), it is most likely attached to the ester group, forming a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-O-CO-CH3). In either case, this fragment accounts for 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.\n\n### 2. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nLet's assemble the identified fragments to build the complete molecule and determine its formula.\n\nThe fragments are:\n1.  A para-substituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n2.  A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n3.  An ester group containing a methyl group: -COOCH3 (methoxycarbonyl) or -O-CO-CH3 (acetoxy)\n\nLet's combine these. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n\n**Scenario 1: Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**\n*   Ring: C6H4 (6C, 4H)\n*   Substituent 1 (propenyl): -CH=CH-CH3 (3C, 5H)\n*   Substituent 2 (methoxycarbonyl): -COOCH3 (2C, 3H, 2O)\n*   **Total Atoms:**\n    *   Carbon (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C11H12O2\n\nThis structure is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### 3. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency, can be calculated from the structural features and also from the molecular formula. They must match.\n\n*   **DBE from Structure:**\n    *   Benzene ring = 4\n    *   C=C double bond (vinyl) = 1\n    *   C=O double bond (ester) = 1\n    *   **Total Expected DBE = 6**\n\n*   **DBE from Proposed Formulas:** (DBE = C - H/2 + 1 for CxHyO2)\n    *   A) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. (DBE matches, but atom count from fragments does not)\n    *   B) **C11H12O2**: DBE = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**. (DBE and atom count both match)\n    *   C) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7. (DBE does not match)\n    *   D) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5. (DBE does not match)\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data leads to a structure with the molecular formula C11H12O2. The calculation of the Degree of Unsaturation confirms this result. The other options are inconsistent with either the number of atoms deduced from the NMR signals or the required DBE.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_compound(options):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectroscopic data to determine the correct molecular formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Analysis from Spectroscopic Data ---\n    # Aromatic ring (para-disubstituted): C6H4 -> 6 C, 4 H, DBE=4\n    # Vinyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): C3H5 -> 3 C, 5 H, DBE=1\n    # Ester group with methyl (-COOCH3 or -OCOCH3): C2H3O2 -> 2 C, 3 H, DBE=1\n    \n    # Summing the fragments:\n    # This assumes a structure like Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate\n    # or 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate.\n    \n    # Total C = 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester part) = 11\n    # Total H = 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl ester) = 12\n    # Total O = 2\n    # Deduced Formula: C11H12O2\n    # Deduced DBE = 4 (ring) + 1 (C=C) + 1 (C=O) = 6\n    \n    print(\"--- Analysis Summary ---\")\n    print(\"Deduced from spectra:\")\n    print(\"  - Total Hydrogens (4 arom + 2 vinyl + 3 vinyl-Me + 3 ester-Me) = 12 H\")\n    print(\"  - Total Carbons (6 arom + 3 propenyl + 2 ester-part) = 11 C\")\n    print(\"  - Required DBE (ring + C=C + C=O) = 6\")\n    print(\"  - Deduced Formula: C11H12O2\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"--- Checking Options ---\")\n    for key, formula in options.items():\n        import re\n        parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d+)', formula)\n        C = int(parts[0][1])\n        H = int(parts[1][1])\n        dbe = C - H/2 + 1\n        \n        match_C = (C == 11)\n        match_H = (H == 12)\n        match_dbe = (dbe == 6)\n        \n        print(f\"Option {key} ({formula}): C={C}, H={H}, DBE={dbe}\")\n        print(f\"  - Matches Deduced C? {match_C}\")\n        print(f\"  - Matches Deduced H? {match_H}\")\n        print(f\"  - Matches Deduced DBE? {match_dbe}\")\n        if match_C and match_H and match_dbe:\n            print(f\"  - Conclusion: This is the correct formula.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"  - Conclusion: Incorrect formula.\")\n        print(\"-\" * 20)\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"C12H14O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C11H12O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C12H12O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C11H14O2\"\n}\n\nanalyze_compound(options)\n```\n>>>\n--- Analysis Summary ---\nDeduced from spectra:\n  - Total Hydrogens (4 arom + 2 vinyl + 3 vinyl-Me + 3 ester-Me) = 12 H\n  - Total Carbons (6 arom + 3 propenyl + 2 ester-part) = 11 C\n  - Required DBE (ring + C=C + C=O) = 6\n  - Deduced Formula: C11H12O2\n\n--- Checking Options ---\nOption A (C12H14O2): C=12, H=14, DBE=6.0\n  - Matches Deduced C?

    "Based on the analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, we can deduce the structure and molecular formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The 1H NMR shows two signals for aromatic protons, which is characteristic of a 1,4- (para) substituted benzene ring. This fragment accounts for **C6H4**.\n\n2.  **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This adds **2 oxygen atoms** and a carbonyl group (C=O) to the structure.\n\n3.  **Vinyl Group:** The 1H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This specific splitting pattern is indicative of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**. This fragment contains **C3H5** and a C=C double bond.\n\n4.  **Methyl Groups:** The 1H NMR shows two -CH3 signals.\n    *   One -CH3 group is part of the propenyl group identified above.\n    *   The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester. Since there are no -CH2- signals, it cannot be an ethyl ester. It must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3). In either case, this part of the molecule contributes **C1H3**.\n\n5.  **Assembling the Fragments:** Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 1 (from ester carbonyl C) + 1 (from ester methyl C) = **11 Carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from ester methyl H) = **12 Hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n\n6.  **Molecular Formula:** The assembled structure gives a molecular formula of **C11H12O2**.\n\n7.  **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   From the structure: 1 ring (DBE=1) + 3 double bonds in the ring (DBE=3) + 1 C=C double bond (DBE=1) + 1 C=O double bond (DBE=1) = **Total DBE of 6**.\n    *   From the formula C11H12O2: DBE = C - H/2 + 1 = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**.\n    *   The DBE matches, confirming the formula is correct.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, C11H12O2 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
