    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe decay of a stationary particle is governed by two fundamental conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the decay must equal the total energy of the system after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the decay must equal the total momentum of the system after the decay.\n\n**2. Define the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A stationary pion ($\\pi^+$).\n    *   Since it's stationary, its initial momentum ($p_{initial}$) is 0.\n    *   Its total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is its rest energy, $E_{\\pi} = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n\n*   **Final State:** A muon ($\\mu^+$) and a neutrino ($\\nu$).\n    *   Let their momenta be $p_{\\mu}$ and $p_{\\nu}$, and their total energies be $E_{\\mu}$ and $E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   The total final energy is $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   The total final momentum is $p_{final} = p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu}$.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   $p_{initial} = p_{final}$\n*   $0 = p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu}$\n*   This implies $p_{\\mu} = -p_{\\nu}$. The muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude. Let's call this magnitude 'p', so $|p_{\\mu}| = |p_{\\nu}| = p$.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n*   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nWe also need the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n\n*   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n*   For the neutrino: We assume the neutrino is massless ($m_{\\nu} = 0$), so its energy is $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$.\n\n**5. Solve for the Unknowns**\n\nSubstitute the expressions for $E_{\\mu}$ and $E_{\\nu}$ into the energy conservation equation:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\nNow, we solve for the momentum term, `pc`:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n\nSquare both sides of the equation:\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n\nThe $(pc)^2$ terms on both sides cancel out:\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n\nRearrange to isolate `pc`:\n$2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculation with the given values:\n*   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n*   $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n\n```python\n# Given rest masses in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest energy of Pi(+)\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest energy of mu(+)\n\n# Calculate the momentum term (pc) using the derived formula\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its total energy, which is pc\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The total energy of the muon can be found from energy conservation\nE_mu = m_pi_c2 - KE_nu\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the kinetic energy of the muon ($\\mu^+$) is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino ($\\nu$) is approximately 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary particle, which is governed by the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   We have a stationary pion ($\\pi^+$).\n*   Since it is stationary, its initial momentum ($p_{initial}$) is 0.\n*   Its total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is its rest energy, $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV.\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   The pion decays into a muon ($\\mu^+$) and a neutrino ($\\nu$).\n*   Let the momentum of the muon be $p_{\\mu}$ and the momentum of the neutrino be $p_{\\nu}$.\n*   Let the total energy of the muon be $E_{\\mu}$ and the total energy of the neutrino be $E_{\\nu}$.\n\n**3. Conservation of Momentum:**\n*   The total momentum before must equal the total momentum after.\n*   $p_{initial} = p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu}$\n*   $0 = p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu} \\implies p_{\\mu} = -p_{\\nu}$\n*   This means the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with the same magnitude of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p', so $|p_{\\mu}| = |p_{\\nu}| = p$.\n\n**4. Conservation of Energy:**\n*   The total energy before must equal the total energy after.\n*   $E_{initial} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n*   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n*   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n*   For the neutrino (assumed massless): $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\nNow, we solve for the momentum term, `pc`:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\nSquaring both sides:\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\nThe $(pc)^2$ terms cancel out:\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\nRearranging to solve for `pc`:\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**5. Calculate Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n*   **KE of Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):** Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\n    $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$\n*   **KE of Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):** The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy.\n    $KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n    From energy conservation, $E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc$.\n    So, $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc) - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n\n**Calculation:**\nUsing the provided values:\n*   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n*   $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n\nFirst, calculate `pc`:\n$pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78$ MeV\n\nNow, find the kinetic energies:\n*   $KE_{\\nu} = pc \\approx 29.8$ MeV\n*   $KE_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 - pc = 139.6 - 105.7 - 29.78 = 33.9 - 29.78 \\approx 4.12$ MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.8 MeV.
