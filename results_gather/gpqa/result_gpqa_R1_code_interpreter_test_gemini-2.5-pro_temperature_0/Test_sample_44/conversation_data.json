    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System and Energy Levels**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its spatial quantum number `n` and its spin quantum number `m_s`.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy levels for this system are given by:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n    where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²). Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n    E_n = n² * E\n*   **Spin States:** For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin quantum number `m_s` can have two values: +1/2 (spin up, ↑) and -1/2 (spin down, ↓).\n*   **State Occupancy:** Due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each spatial energy level `E_n` can hold at most two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_gs)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (E₁ = 1²E = 1E):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Level n=2 (E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\nE_gs = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\nE_gs = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E)\nE_gs = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nTo get the first excited state, we need to create the lowest possible energy excitation from the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2 (Energy = 4E)\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3 (Energy E₃ = 3²E = 9E)\n*   **Excitation:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:**\n    *   Two particles in n=1 (Energy = 1E each)\n    *   One particle in n=2 (Energy = 4E)\n    *   One particle in n=3 (Energy = 9E)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\nE_1st = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E)\nE_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. We need to consider different possible excitations from the ground state.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (by promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3)\n\nLet's consider other possible single-particle promotions from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote the second particle from n=2 to n=3 (a two-particle excitation relative to the ground state).\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the state with the next lowest energy after 15E is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state energy is:\nE_2nd = 18E\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\nTo verify this systematically, we can use a short Python script to find the lowest energy combinations.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_particle_energies():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energies of the ground, first, and second excited states\n    for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Single-particle energy levels (n^2), each duplicated for spin degeneracy.\n    # We consider levels up to n=5, which is sufficient.\n    single_particle_energies = []\n    for n in range(1, 6):\n        single_particle_energies.append(n*n)\n        single_particle_energies.append(n*n)\n\n    # Find all unique combinations of 4 particles from these energy levels.\n    # Using a set to store total energies automatically handles duplicates.\n    total_energies = set()\n    for combo in itertools.combinations(single_particle_energies, 4):\n        total_energies.add(sum(combo))\n\n    # Sort the unique energies in ascending order.\n    sorted_energies = sorted(list(total_energies))\n\n    # The first three energies are the ground, first excited, and second excited states.\n    ground_state = sorted_energies[0]\n    first_excited = sorted_energies[1]\n    second_excited = sorted_energies[2]\n\n    print(f\"The energies of the three lowest states are: {ground_state}E, {first_excited}E, {second_excited}E\")\n\nsolve_particle_energies()\n```\nThe energies of the three lowest states are: 10E, 15E, 18E\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Understand the System's Properties**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by both its spatial part (quantum number `n`) and its spin part (spin up ↑ or spin down ↓). This means each spatial energy level `E_n` can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L are given by:\n    E_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n    The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²). So, the single-particle energy levels can be written as:\n    *   E₁ = 1²E = 1E\n    *   E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n    *   E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n    *   E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n    *   and so on...\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_gs)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   We place the first two particles in the n=1 level (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₁ = 2 × 1E = 2E.\n*   We place the next two particles in the n=2 level (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_gs = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is formed by the lowest possible energy excitation from the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n\n*   The new configuration will have:\n    *   Two particles in the n=1 level (Energy: 2 × 1E = 2E)\n    *   One particle in the n=2 level (Energy: 1 × 4E = 4E)\n    *   One particle in the n=3 level (Energy: 1 × 9E = 9E)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider different possible excitations from the ground state.\n\n*   **Excitation 1 (already found):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Total Energy = 15E.\n*   **Excitation 2:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Excitation 3:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Excitation 4:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Total Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the possible excitation energies (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is the ground state (10E), the next lowest is the first excited state (15E), and the one after that is the second excited state (18E).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Ground State Energy = 10E\n*   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n*   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
