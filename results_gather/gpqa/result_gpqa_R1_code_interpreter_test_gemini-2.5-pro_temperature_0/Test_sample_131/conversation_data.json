    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to identify which pair of compounds from the given options corresponds to the described 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided NMR Data**\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This means we have two types of aromatic protons, and since the mixture is 1:1, each signal must correspond to the same number of protons in their respective molecules.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This means there are three distinct types of aliphatic protons (likely methyl groups, as they are singlets) in the mixture, and their total proton counts are in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and symmetry of each compound to predict its individual 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Formula: C10H14. Correct.\n    *   Symmetry: Highly symmetric. There are two planes of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will produce a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a **single singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Formula: C10H14. Correct.\n    *   Symmetry: A plane of symmetry passes through the C2-C5 axis.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are meta to each other and have no adjacent protons, so they will produce a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three aliphatic singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is **2:1:1**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Formula: C10H14. Correct.\n    *   Symmetry: A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although adjacent, their chemical equivalence makes them appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two aliphatic singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).*\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Formula: C10H14. Correct.\n    *   Symmetry: Highly symmetric.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The four protons on the ring are all equivalent, producing a **single singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: The two ethyl groups are equivalent.\n        1.  The two -CH2- groups are equivalent and split by the -CH3 groups, producing a **quartet** (4H).\n        2.  The two -CH3- groups are equivalent and split by the -CH2- groups, producing a **triplet** (6H).\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).*\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options by Combining the Spectra**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives a 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives a 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 mixture and both signals are 2H, the integration ratio is **1:1**. (Matches)\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. The mixture will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. (Matches)\n    *   **Conclusion: This option is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Prehnitene gives two singlets (6H, 6H). Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (e.g., 12H, 6H, 3H, 3H if one pair overlaps) or five signals. This contradicts the observation of only three aliphatic singlets. (Does not match)\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Isodurene gives a 2H singlet. 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a 4H singlet. The integration ratio would be 2:4 or 1:2. This contradicts the observed 1:1 ratio. (Does not match)\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,4-diethylbenzene introduces a quartet and a triplet, which are not observed. (Does not match)\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have four aliphatic singlets in total. This contradicts the observation of only three. (Does not match)\n\n**5.

    "To solve this problem, we need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the candidate molecules and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**Experimental Data for the 1:1 Mixture:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Individual Compound**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric, with two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.
