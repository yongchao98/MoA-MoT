    "This problem is based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), this relationship is given by:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of a state.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state (τ).\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\n*   **Energy Width of a State:** The lifetime of a quantum state (τ) leads to an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy level (ΔE). For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can use the approximation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n*   **Resolving Energy Levels:** To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than the energy widths (uncertainties) of the individual levels. A good rule of thumb is that the energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two energy widths.\n    |E₁ - E₂| > max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂)\n\n*   **Calculations:**\n    1.  We need the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ, in units of eV·s to match the units in the options.\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    2.  Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for the first state (ΔE₁):\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    3.  Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for the second state (ΔE₂):\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n    4.  Determine the condition for resolvability:\n        *   The larger of the two energy widths is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n        *   Therefore, to clearly resolve the two levels, the energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be greater than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    5.  Compare this requirement with the given options:\n        *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV (This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n        *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV (This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n        *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV (This is much larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n        *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Only option C provides an energy difference large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished, as it is the only value greater than the inherent energy width of the shorter-lived state.\n\n**2. Python Code for Verification**\nThe following Python code automates the calculation to confirm the result.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state using Delta_E = hbar / tau\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The minimum energy difference required to resolve the levels is on the order of the larger energy width.\nrequired_energy_difference = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (Delta_E1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (Delta_E2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"To resolve the levels, the energy difference must be greater than: {required_energy_difference:.3e} eV\")\n\n# The options provided\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-9,\n    \"B\": 1e-8,\n    \"C\": 1e-4,\n    \"D\": 1e-11\n}\n\n# Check which option satisfies the condition\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\")\n\n```\n**3. Final Answer**\nThe code output confirms that the required energy difference must be greater than approximately 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Comparing this with the given options, only 10⁻⁴ eV is sufficiently large.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Identify the core principle:** The problem relates the lifetime of a quantum state to its energy. This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n*   **State the principle:** The Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle is given by ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. In this context, Δt is the lifetime of the state (τ), and ΔE is the inherent uncertainty or \"width\" of the energy level. For practical calculations, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n*   **Define \"clearly resolved\":** For two energy levels, E₁ and E₂, to be clearly resolved or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than the uncertainty in their energies. Since both levels have an energy width, the energy difference must be greater than the widths of both levels. A conservative condition is that the energy difference must be greater than the *larger* of the two energy widths: |E₁ - E₂| > max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂).\n*   **List the given values:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   **List the required constant:**\n    *   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n*   **Calculate the energy width for state 1 (ΔE₁):**\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n*   **Calculate the energy width for state 2 (ΔE₂):**\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n*   **Determine the condition for resolution:**\n    *   We need to compare ΔE₁ and ΔE₂.\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n    *   Clearly, ΔE₁ is larger than ΔE₂. This makes sense, as the shorter lifetime leads to a larger energy uncertainty.\n    *   The condition for the levels to be resolved is |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁.\n    *   Therefore, |E₁ - E₂| must be greater than ~6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV < 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV < 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Resolvable)\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV < 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n*   **Conclusion:** The only energy difference that is large enough to clearly resolve the two energy levels is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n**2.
