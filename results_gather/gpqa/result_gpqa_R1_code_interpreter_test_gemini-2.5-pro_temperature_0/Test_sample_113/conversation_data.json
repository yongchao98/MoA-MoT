    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Reactants:** Butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which is a strong nucleophile.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** This reaction is a nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond and forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. This intermediate then needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. The reaction is typically catalyzed by acid. Adding a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) to the NaCN solution generates HCN in situ, which then adds to the ketone. The general representation for an aqueous acid is the hydronium ion, H₃O⁺.\n    *   **Evaluating options for A:**\n        *   NaHSO₃: This reagent is used for bisulfite addition, a different type of reaction.\n        *   H₃O⁺: This is a strong acid source, perfect for protonating the intermediate and catalyzing the reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A is H₃O⁺. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Reactant:** The starting material is a nitrile (-C≡N).\n    *   **Product:** The final product is a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The conversion of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid group is a hydrolysis reaction. This hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. The reaction involves the addition of water across the carbon-nitrogen triple bond.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B, in the presence of water, must facilitate this hydrolysis.\n    *   **Evaluating options for B (from the remaining choices B and C):**\n        *   HCl (Hydrochloric acid): This is a strong mineral acid and is a standard reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   CH₃COOH (Acetic acid): This is a weak organic acid. While it might be able to protonate the nitrile to some extent, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions. Strong acids are required.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B is HCl.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
