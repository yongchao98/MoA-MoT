    "To determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which molecules are chiral and are present as a single enantiomer (or a non-racemic mixture). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Common indicators of chirality are the presence of stereocenters (like a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) without the molecule having an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule is built around a C=C double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is essentially planar.\n    *   A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself includes stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS,E)`.\n    *   These descriptors specify a single, specific stereoisomer of a complex molecule that has multiple chiral centers (C3a and C7a) and a chiral E/Z configuration at the exocyclic double bond.\n    *   When a specific enantiomer (like one with R and S configurations specified) is isolated, it is by definition chiral and will be optically active.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are identical to the substituents on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon).\n    *   In such cases, the stereoisomer with opposite configurations at the two centers (one R, one S) is a `meso` compound.\n    *   A `meso` compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (in this case, a center of inversion).\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has the `(R,R)` configuration.\n    *   This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer.\n    *   Since the name specifies a single enantiomer `(2R,3R)`, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The carbon atom C1, which is bonded to the -OH group, is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and 4) the `-CH2-CH=CH-` part of the ring. The paths around the ring are different, so groups 3 and 4 are different.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This compound has three hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation, along with the high symmetry of the substitution pattern, refers to the `all-cis` isomer.\n    *   In the `all-cis` isomer, all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring's average plane.\n    *   This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through any of the C-OH bonds and the opposite CH2 group is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and a `CH2` group, so it is not chiral. No other carbon atom is bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that can pass through the `C=O`, `CH2`, and `CH` groups, bisecting the two methyl groups and the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nTo summarize:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive (achiral)\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
