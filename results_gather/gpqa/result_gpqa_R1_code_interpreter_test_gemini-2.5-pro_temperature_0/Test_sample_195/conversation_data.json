    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\n    In a closed system, the total energy is conserved. For a relativistic particle moving in a potential, the total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy. The relativistic energy itself is the sum of the rest energy ($E_0 = mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$).\n    So, the total energy can be written as:\n    $E_{total} = (\\text{Kinetic Energy}) + (\\text{Potential Energy}) + (\\text{Rest Energy})$\n    $E_{total} = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + U(x) + mc^2$\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, $m$ is the mass, $v$ is the speed, $c$ is the speed of light, and $U(x)$ is the potential energy.\n\n2.  **Define the Potential Energy:**\n    The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ for this conservative force is given by:\n    $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    So, the total conserved energy of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is:\n    $E_{total} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy at Two Key Points:**\n    We can evaluate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillator's motion and set them equal to each other.\n\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum Amplitude (x = A)**\n        At the maximum amplitude, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction.\n        So, at $x = A$, the speed is $v = 0$.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = 1 \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**\n        The mass has its maximum speed when it passes through the equilibrium position, where the potential energy is zero.\n        So, at $x = 0$, the speed is $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max:**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at Point 1 must equal the energy at Point 2:\n    $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    Now, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$. First, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing by $mc^2$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we perform the following algebraic steps:\n    a. Invert both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    b. Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    c. Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    d. Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n    $v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} \\right)$\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    This matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
