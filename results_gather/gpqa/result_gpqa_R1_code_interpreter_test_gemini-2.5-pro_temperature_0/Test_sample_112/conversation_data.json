    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this peak to be exceptionally broad, often spanning from 2500 to 3300 cm⁻¹. While alcohols also have a broad O-H peak, it is typically centered higher (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹) and is less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the characteristic range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which corroborates the FTIR data (1650 cm⁻¹ peak).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12.01) + (2 × 16.00) + (1 × 1.01) ≈ 45\n    *   This m/z = 45 peak is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, resulting from the cleavage of the bond adjacent to the carboxyl group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The combined data strongly indicates that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid** (it has at least one C=C bond and one -COOH group).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond.\n    *   An alkene group (C=C) contains one C=C double bond.\n    *   The presence of these two features means the molecule must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of at least 2 (one for the C=O and one for the C=C).\n\n    Now, let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation for each of the given formulas using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_dou(formula):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a given chemical formula C_x H_y O_z.\"\"\"\n        import re\n        parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n        counts = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in parts}\n        C = counts.get('C', 0)\n        H = counts.get('H', 0)\n        \n        # The formula for DoU is C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2.\n        # Oxygen does not affect the calculation.\n        dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n        return dou\n\n    formulas = {\n        \"A\": \"C6H10O\",\n        \"B\": \"C6H12O\",\n        \"C\": \"C6H12O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C6H10O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each option:\")\n    for option, formula in formulas.items():\n        dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n        print(f\"Option {option}) {formula}: DoU = {int(dou)}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nAnalysis:\")\n    print(\"The compound must have a DoU of at least 2 (one for C=O in the acid, one for C=C).\")\n    print(\"The compound must have 2 oxygen atoms to be a carboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\"Option A (C6H10O): DoU=2, but only one oxygen. Incorrect.\")\n    print(\"Option B (C6H12O): DoU=1. Insufficient unsaturation. Incorrect.\")\n    print(\"Option C (C6H12O2): DoU=1. Insufficient unsaturation for both an acid and an alkene. Incorrect.\")\n    print(\"Option D (C6H10O2): DoU=2 and has two oxygens. This is consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\")\n    ```\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A) C6H10O:** DoU = 2. While the DoU is correct, this formula only has one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **B) C6H12O:** DoU = 1. This degree of unsaturation is too low. It could account for either a C=O or a C=C, but not both.\n*   **C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 1. This is also too low. This formula could represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but that would not explain the alkene signals (FTIR at 1650 cm⁻¹ and vinyl protons in NMR).\n*   **D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 2. This formula has the correct degree of unsaturation to accommodate both a C=C double bond and the C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid group. It also has the necessary two oxygen atoms for the -COOH group.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
