    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (DBE=4) plus one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a C=O or C=C bond, or another ring).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to an adjacent group with 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH2 group. Its multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to a single proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This is consistent with the -CH2-CHO fragment, where the CH2 protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton. The chemical shift is appropriate for a benzylic methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The upfield chemical shifts (especially 6.51 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. This is characteristic of an amino group (-NH2) attached to an aromatic ring. The amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shifts of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n    The structure of the starting material is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) -> C8H9NO. This is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl:** These are the reagents for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   Intermediate A: 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O:** Adding water to the diazonium salt solution (usually with gentle heating) results in the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt, replacing the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Intermediate B: **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde)\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This is a strong base with heat. The intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, has an aldehyde group with acidic α-protons (on the CH2 group). This is a classic condition for an **aldol condensation** reaction. Since there is only one type of aldehyde, it will be a self-condensation.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the product of the aldol condensation.**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two main stages: aldol addition followed by dehydration.\n\n1.  **Aldol Addition:**\n    *   The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n    *   Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields the aldol addition product.\n    *   The structure of the aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option C).\n\n     \n\n2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):**\n    *   The reaction conditions include **heat**, which promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product.\n    *   The base (OH-) removes the acidic proton from the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (C2). The resulting carbanion eliminates the hydroxyl group from the beta-carbon (C3).\n    *   This forms a double bond between C2 and C3, resulting in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n     \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence transforms 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal into 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. The presence of heat ensures that the reaction proceeds to the final dehydrated product, which is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. This matches option B.\n\n*   Option A is incorrect as it would result from a different set of reactants.\n*   Option C is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   Option D is incorrect as it lacks the hydroxyl groups formed during the reaction sequence.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
