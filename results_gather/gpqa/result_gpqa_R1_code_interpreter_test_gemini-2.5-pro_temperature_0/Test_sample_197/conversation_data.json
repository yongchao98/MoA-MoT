    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Chemical Equilibria:** In a solution containing Co²⁺ and SCN⁻, a series of complexation reactions occur:\n    *   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ <=> [Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ <=> [Co(SCN)2]`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ <=> [Co(SCN)3]⁻`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ <=> [Co(SCN)4]²⁻`\n\n3.  **Define the Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)4]²⁻]`\n\n4.  **Use the Overall Stability Constants (β):** The concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (βn):\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β1 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]⁻] = β3 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]²⁻] = β4 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n5.  **Formulate the Distribution Coefficient (α):** The fraction of a specific complex, for example `[Co(SCN)2]`, is denoted by `α2`. It is the ratio of the concentration of that complex to the total cobalt concentration.\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    By substituting the expressions from steps 3 and 4, we can derive a general formula for `α2`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β1[SCN⁻] + β2[SCN⁻]² + β3[SCN⁻]³ + β4[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n    `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n\n    Dividing the second equation by the first, the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β1[SCN⁻] + β2[SCN⁻]² + β3[SCN⁻]³ + β4[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n6.  **Interpret the Given Concentrations:**\n    *   Total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`. This value is not needed to calculate the percentage, but it confirms that cobalt is a minor component compared to the ligand.\n    *   Thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. In this context, especially when one of the options is a direct result of this assumption, `[SCN⁻]` is treated as the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand.\n\n7.  **Perform the Calculation:** Substitute the given values into the formula for `α2`.\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   `β1` = 9\n    *   `β2` = 40\n    *   `β3` = 63\n    *   `β4` = 16\n\n    First, calculate the denominator, which is the sum of all terms in the distribution equation (let's call it `D`):\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β1 * [SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)2]`: `β2 * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)3]⁻`: `β3 * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)4]²⁻`: `β4 * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    `D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    The numerator is the term corresponding to the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)2]`, which is 0.4.\n\n    Now, calculate `α2`:\n    `α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646`\n\n    To ensure precision, let's use a Python script for the final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The denominator of the alpha expression is the sum of all fractional terms\n# Let L = [SCN-]\n# Denominator = 1 + beta1*L + beta2*L^2 + beta3*L^3 + beta4*L^4\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * scn_conc + beta2 * scn_conc**2 + beta3 * scn_conc**3 + beta4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# The numerator for alpha2 is the term for the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator_alpha2 = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha2\nalpha2 = numerator_alpha2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_alpha2 = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage_alpha2)\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, among all cobalt-containing species. This percentage is determined by the distribution coefficient, α₂, for this species.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each species in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, and the free ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nSubstituting these into the total concentration equation gives:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, α₂, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M (Since the total cobalt concentration is much lower than the thiocyanate concentration, we can assume the free thiocyanate concentration is approximately equal to its initial concentration).\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nNow, we can calculate the numerator and the denominator of the expression for α₂.\n\n*   **Numerator**: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β₁ * [SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n    *   **Sum of denominator terms**: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n*   **Calculate α₂**: `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\nThe code output confirms this calculation.
