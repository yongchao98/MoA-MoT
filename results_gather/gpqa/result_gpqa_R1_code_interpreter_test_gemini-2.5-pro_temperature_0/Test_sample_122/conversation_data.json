    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S). This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S'). This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame is `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Measurement:**\n    The time `Δt' = 50 s` is measured in the ejecta's own frame of reference. A time interval measured by a clock that is at rest relative to the events it is timing is called the **proper time** (`Δt₀`). In this case, the start and end of the 50-second interval occur at the same location as the ejecta, so `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Concept of Time Dilation:**\n    According to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy, S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for events happening in a moving frame (the ejecta, S'). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The relationship is given by the formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    First, let's find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, we can calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    Now we can find the time elapsed as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame:**\n    The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame. The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`. We must use the velocity `v` and the time `Δt` as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n    `Distance = v * Δt`\n    `Distance = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `Distance = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `Distance = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n8.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    To get the final numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt0 = 50   # proper time in seconds\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n\n# Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt0\n\n# Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n>>>\n3061862.178478362\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 3,060,000 km\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 2,940,000 km\nD) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option A. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's design.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference: the Galaxy's frame (let's call it S) and the supernova ejecta's frame (S').\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time measured in the ejecta's frame is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the proper time, `Δt₀`, because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in its own frame (the ejecta).\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    From the perspective of an observer in the Galaxy's frame (S), time in the moving ejecta's frame (S') appears to pass more slowly. The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`) by the time dilation formula from special relativity:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    First, we calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n    `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, we can calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    Using the time dilation formula, we can find the time interval as measured by an observer in the Galaxy:\n    `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame:**\n    The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame. This distance is the ejecta's velocity (as measured in the Galaxy's frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (also as measured in the Galaxy's frame).\n    `Distance = v * Δt`\n    `Distance = 60,000 km/s * [ (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s ]`\n    `Distance = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `Distance = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    The calculation was performed using the provided Python script.\n    *   `v = 60000`\n    *   `dt0 = 50`\n    *   `c = 300000`\n    *   `distance = v * (1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)) * dt0`\n    The output of the code is `3061862.178478973` km.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km\n\n    The calculated value of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option A. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
