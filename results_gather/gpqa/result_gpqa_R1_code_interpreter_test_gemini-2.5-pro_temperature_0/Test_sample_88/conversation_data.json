    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to understand the types of molecules involved.**\n\n1.  **Reaction 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH to form product **1**. The spectral data for **1** (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹) indicates the presence of a carbonyl group, most likely a ketone. The ¹H NMR integration (2H + 10H + 2H = 14H) corresponds to the number of hydrogens in the starting material, so the formula of **1** is C₁₀H₁₄O. Thus, **1** is a saturated ketone, an isomer of adamantanone. The exact structure of **1** is difficult to determine from the given data and known reactions, as the provided NMR spectrum (3 signals) suggests a much higher symmetry than expected for common rearrangement products like protoadamantan-4-one. However, we can proceed by understanding the nature of the subsequent reactions.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2:** Product **1** (a ketone) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, (i-PrO)₃Al, to form product **2**. This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts a ketone to an alcohol. The reaction is \"heated,\" which suggests that the initially formed alcohol may undergo a subsequent reaction.\n\n3.  **Reaction 3:** Product **2** is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a classic ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The DMS provides a reductive workup, converting the intermediate ozonide into aldehydes or ketones.\n\n**Step 2: Reconcile the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   There is an apparent contradiction: Reaction 2 should produce an alcohol (from a ketone), but Reaction 3 requires an alkene as the starting material.\n*   The most logical explanation is that the reaction conditions for step 2 (heating with a Lewis acid, Al(O-iPr)₃) cause both the reduction of the ketone **1** to an intermediate alcohol and the subsequent dehydration of that alcohol to form an alkene, which is product **2**.\n*   Therefore, the overall sequence is:\n    *   **1** (Ketone, C₁₀H₁₄O) → [Intermediate Alcohol, C₁₀H₁₆O] → **2** (Alkene, C₁₀H₁₄)\n    *   **2** (Alkene, C₁₀H₁₄) → **3** (Dicarbonyl compound, C₁₀H₁₄O₂)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the key intermediates.**\n\n*   **Structure of Alkene 2:** The formation of **1** from 1,3-dibromoadamantane under harsh basic conditions is known to involve skeletal rearrangements. A well-documented product from this type of reaction is **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). This is a stable C₁₀H₁₄ alkene and is the most plausible structure for product **2**.\n\n*   **Structure of Dicarbonyl 3:** Product **3** is formed by the ozonolysis of alkene **2** (protoadamant-4-ene). Ozonolysis cleaves the C4=C5 double bond of the protoadamantene skeleton. This cleavage opens one of the rings, transforming the tricyclic skeleton into a bicyclic one. The product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carbaldehyde-7-one**.\n    *   The formula is C₁₀H₁₄O₂, which is consistent with the addition of two oxygen atoms to C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   The structure contains a ketone group at position 7 and an aldehyde group at position 3 of a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring system.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of product 3.**\n\n*   **Identify the most deshielded hydrogen:** In a molecule containing only C, H, and O, with ketone and aldehyde functional groups, the aldehyde proton (-CHO) is by far the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. Its chemical shift is typically in the 9-10 ppm range.\n\n*   **Determine the coupling pattern (splitting) of the aldehyde proton:**\n    1.  **Three-bond coupling (³J):** The aldehyde proton is separated by three bonds from the proton on the adjacent carbon, C3. Since C3 is a tertiary carbon (a CH group), there is one proton on it. This coupling (³J_H-C-C-H) will split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **doublet**.\n    2.  **Long-range coupling (⁴J):** In rigid cyclic systems like this, long-range coupling over four or more bonds can be significant, especially when the protons have a \"W\" or zig-zag spatial arrangement. The aldehyde proton is in a position to couple with the axial protons on C2 and C4.\n    3.  **Interpreting the options:** The answer choices are \"triplet\", \"pentet\", \"doublet of triplets\", and \"triplet of triplets\". The fact that \"doublet\" is not an option strongly implies that significant long-range coupling is occurring.\n    4.  A **\"doublet of triplets\"** pattern arises when a proton couples to one neighboring proton (giving the doublet) and a set of two other equivalent protons (giving the triplet).\n    5.  In our structure (**3**), the aldehyde proton couples to the single proton at C3, which accounts for the **doublet** splitting. The molecule has no symmetry, so the protons on C2 and C4 are not technically equivalent. However, in complex molecules, \"accidental equivalence\" of coupling constants is common. It is plausible that the long-range coupling constants to the two relevant protons (one on C2 and one on C4) are nearly identical, J(H, H₂ₐ) ≈ J(H, H₄ₐ). This pair of protons would thus split the signal into a **triplet**.\n    6.  Combining these effects, the signal for the most deshielded proton (the aldehyde proton) would be a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The most deshielded proton is the aldehyde proton. It is split into a doublet by the C3 proton and into a triplet by long-range coupling to two accidentally equivalent protons on the bicyclic ring.\n\n<<<A>>>"
