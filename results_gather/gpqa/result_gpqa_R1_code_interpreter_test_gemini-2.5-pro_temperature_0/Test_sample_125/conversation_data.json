    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the carbonyl group (C=O) at carbon 3 (C3) to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either the front face or the back face of the planar carbonyl group. This creates a new stereocenter at C3. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products:** The reduction results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** Since one stereocenter is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This molecule is achiral as it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** The dione is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The starting material is achiral, and the molecule is symmetric about C3. This leads to the formation of a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Products:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (which is (2R, 4S) or (2S, 4R) - they are the same achiral compound).\n*   **Relationship:** (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers**. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It can separate compounds with different physical properties, such as polarity. Therefore, it can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)-ol and (3S, 5S)-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)-diol and (2S, 4S)-diol) and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C6 ether-alcohols) are constitutional isomers of the products of Reaction II (C5 diols), so they are structurally very different and will be well-separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 1 peak (from Reaction II enantiomers) + 1 peak (from Reaction II meso compound) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for differential interaction with chiral molecules. It can separate enantiomers in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, it can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains a total of 5 unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Since all five of these compounds are structurally distinct (either as diastereomers or enantiomers), a chiral column is capable of separating all of them. The meso compound is achiral but is a unique stereoisomer that will have its own retention time, distinct from the chiral isomers.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
