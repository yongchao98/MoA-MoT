    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this V=0 condition. We need to find the total potential energy of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem is a classic example where the method of images is used. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the complex distribution of induced charges on the sphere's surface, can be perfectly replicated by a single, fictitious \"image charge\" placed inside the sphere. The potential on the surface of the sphere due to the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must sum to zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   Let the center of the sphere be the origin. The real charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the origin.\n    *   Let the image charge be `q'` at a distance `b` from the origin, along the same line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n    *   The potential `V` at any point on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) must be zero.\n    *   `V_surface = V_q + V_q' = 0`\n    *   Through standard derivation (by ensuring the potential is zero on the surface), the image charge `q'` and its position `b` are found to be:\n        *   Image charge magnitude and sign: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   Note that since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), we have `|q'| < |q|` and `b < R` (the image charge is inside the sphere).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy (U):**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. As the charge `q` is brought in, it induces the charge distribution on the sphere.\n    The energy of a charge `q` in the presence of other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere) is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by all other charges. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge distribution is created by `q` itself.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Induced Potential (V_induced):**\n    The potential at the location of `q` (distance `d` from the center) due to the induced charges on the sphere is, by the method of images, equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    *   The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancel out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy (U):**\n    Now, use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    C) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\n    Our derived result matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
