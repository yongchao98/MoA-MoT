    "Here is a step-by-step process to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH3COOH):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   This provides 0.080 mol of H+ ions.\n\n*   **Moles of Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely into Ba2+ and 2 OH-.\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-, the moles of OH- are:\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol OH-\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong acid (H+ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH- from Ba(OH)2) first.\n\n*   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n*   Initial moles H+ = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles OH- = 0.180 mol\n*   The H+ is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n*   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n*   The CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining after this reaction = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Determine the composition of the final solution.**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains:\n*   Excess strong base: 0.050 mol of OH-\n*   The conjugate base of the weak acid: 0.050 mol of CH3COO-\n*   Spectator ions (Cl-, Ba2+) and water.\n\nThe pH of the solution will be dominated by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH-). The contribution of the weak base (CH3COO-) to the hydroxide concentration is negligible in the presence of a strong base.\n\n**4. Calculate the final pH.**\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial values\nvol_ch3cooh = 0.500  # L\nconc_ch3cooh = 0.1   # M\n\nvol_hcl = 0.400      # L\nconc_hcl = 0.2       # M\n\nvol_baoh2 = 0.300    # L\nconc_baoh2 = 0.3     # M\n\n# 1.
