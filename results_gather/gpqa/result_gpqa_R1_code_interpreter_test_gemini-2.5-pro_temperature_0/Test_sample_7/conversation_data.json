    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Phenotypes of Single Mutants\n\nFirst, let's understand the role of each gene individually by looking at the effect of its knockout. The resistance levels are:\n*   **Wild-type (WT):** 100% (baseline)\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This means G1 contributes to resistance, but its loss is not catastrophic. The loss of function results in a 25% drop in resistance.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This means G2 is absolutely essential for the resistance phenotype. Its loss is catastrophic.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. This means G3 is also important for resistance, more so than G1. Its loss results in a 50% drop in resistance.\n\nFrom this, we can see that G2 is the most critical gene for resistance.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Phenotypes of Double Mutants to Determine Gene Interactions\n\nThe key to understanding how these genes work together is to look at the double mutants. We are looking for epistasis, where the effect of one gene masks the effect of another.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** Resistance is 0%. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g1` mutant (75%) or an intermediate value. When the phenotype of a double mutant matches one of the single mutants, the gene corresponding to that phenotype is said to be **epistatic**. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** Resistance is 0%. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g3` mutant (50%). Therefore, **G2 is also epistatic to G3**.\n\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** Resistance is 10%. This phenotype is different from both the `g1` single mutant (75%) and the `g3` single mutant (50%). In fact, it's much more severe than either one alone. The combined loss of resistance (90%) is greater than the sum of the individual losses (25% + 50% = 75%). This is a **synergistic interaction**.\n\n### 3. Interpret the Interactions to Build a Model\n\n*   **Identifying the Transcription Factor (TF):** The problem states that one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. In a genetic pathway, an upstream gene is often epistatic to a downstream gene. Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it is the strongest candidate for the upstream transcription factor. If G2 is a TF required to activate G1 and G3, knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 from functioning, leading to a complete loss of resistance (0%), which matches the data. This makes the conclusion **\"G2 is a transcription factor\"** very strong.\n\n*   **Characterizing the G1-G3 Relationship:** The synergistic effect seen in the `g1g3` double mutant suggests that G1 and G3 have functions that partially overlap or act in parallel pathways contributing to the same outcome (resistance). When one is knocked out, the other can still provide some function. When both are knocked out, the function is almost completely lost. This relationship is best described as **gene redundancy**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Given Options\n\nNow let's evaluate each option based on our conclusions:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: Plausible if they are co-regulated, but we cannot prove this from the data.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. G2 is the TF candidate.\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: Correct, but the first statement makes the option invalid.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct. This accurately describes the synergistic interaction.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: We don't have data on other traits, so we can't confirm pleiotropy. \"Gene redundancy\" is a much more direct and accurate description of the observed interaction.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption C contains two correct statements that are strongly supported by the experimental data: \"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\". Although its third statement (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is incorrect, it is the best option available as it correctly identifies the main roles and interactions of the genes. The other options contain more significant errors or less accurate descriptions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
