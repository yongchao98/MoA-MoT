    "This question asks us to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of the impulse approximation is that a high-energy probe interacting with a nucleus interacts with a single nucleon, and this interaction is so rapid that the nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle, unaffected by the other nucleons or the nuclear potential during the brief moment of interaction.\n\nLet's analyze each assumption:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is a foundational element of the impulse approximation. It posits that the probe (e.g., an electron, neutrino) interacts with a single nucleon at a time. This excludes more complex interactions, such as those involving meson-exchange currents (where the probe interacts with the virtual particles exchanged between nucleons) or interactions with correlated clusters of nucleons. Without this assumption, one cannot even begin to treat the interaction as a quasi-free event on a single nucleon. Therefore, this assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption deals with what happens before and after the primary interaction. It states that the incoming probe and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) do not interact with the other \"spectator\" nucleons. If these \"final-state interactions\" (or initial-state interactions) were significant, they would alter the energy and momentum of the outgoing particles, and the event would no longer resemble a simple scattering from a free nucleon. While more sophisticated models can account for these effects, the simplest form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation or PWIA) requires this transparency. Thus, this assumption is a key part of the approximation.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, describing it as a bound state of quarks. The impulse approximation, however, is about the behavior of the *nucleon as a whole* within the nuclear medium. It treats the nucleon as the fundamental degree of freedom. The internal structure of the nucleon (whether quarks are relativistic or not) is a separate issue, addressed by nucleon form factors. The impulse approximation can be used in both relativistic and non-relativistic frameworks and does not depend on the internal dynamics of the nucleon being non-relativistic. Therefore, this assumption is not a required component of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the very essence of the \"impulse\" in the impulse approximation. It assumes that the momentum transferred to the nucleon is very large and the interaction time is correspondingly very short. This timescale is assumed to be much shorter than the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus. Consequently, during the brief interaction, the potential energy due to the binding forces from other nucleons is considered negligible compared to the kinetic energy transferred. The nucleon is effectively \"knocked out\" of the nucleus before it has time to interact with its neighbors. This is a crucial assumption.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe impulse approximation is defined by the assumptions that the interaction targets a single nucleon (1), that this nucleon behaves as if it's free from binding forces during the interaction (4), and that the particles involved in the reaction do not re-interact with the rest of the nucleus (2). Assumption (3) is related to the internal structure of the nucleon, not its behavior within the nucleus, and is therefore not a necessary component of the impulse approximation.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
