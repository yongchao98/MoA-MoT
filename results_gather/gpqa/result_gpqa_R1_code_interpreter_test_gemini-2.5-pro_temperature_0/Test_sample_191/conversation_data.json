    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We begin with an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. This means the total charge on the conductor is zero.\n\n2.  **Introduce the charge `+q`:** A positive charge `+q` is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Induction on the inner surface:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. To determine the total amount of this induced charge, we can use Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material, enclosing the cavity.\n    *   In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field (`E`) inside the material of a conductor must be zero.\n    *   Gauss's Law states that the electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    *   Since `E = 0` everywhere on our Gaussian surface, the total flux is zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed by the surface, $Q_{enclosed}$, must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed inside the cavity (`+q`) and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    *   Therefore, $Q_{enclosed} = +q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   This gives us $q_{inner} = -q$. A total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this charge might be non-uniform, depending on the exact location of `+q` inside the cavity, but the total amount is fixed at `-q`.\n\n4.  **Induction on the outer surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall charge neutrality. These positive charges will repel each other and move as far apart as possible, which means they will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n    *   So, a charge of $q_{outer} = +q$ appears on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n5.  **Shielding Effect (Faraday Cage):** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside it. The charges on the conductor rearrange themselves to ensure this. The field produced by the original charge `+q` and the induced inner surface charge `-q` is completely cancelled outside the cavity by the conductor. Therefore, for any point P outside the conductor, the net electric field from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero.\n\n6.  **Distribution of charge on the outer surface:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of charges inside the cavity. From the perspective of the charges on the outer surface, they are simply on a spherical conductor. To achieve electrostatic equilibrium (the lowest energy state), these charges will spread out uniformly over the spherical outer surface of radius `R`.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The total electric field at point P is the superposition of the fields from all charges.\n    *   $\\vec{E}_P = \\vec{E}_{(\\text{from +q in cavity})} + \\vec{E}_{(\\text{from -q on inner surface})} + \\vec{E}_{(\\text{from +q on outer surface})}$\n    *   As established by the shielding principle, the first two terms sum to zero for any point outside the conductor: $\\vec{E}_{(\\text{from +q in cavity})} + \\vec{E}_{(\\text{from -q on inner surface})} = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the field at P is solely due to the charge `+q` distributed uniformly on the outer surface: $\\vec{E}_P = \\vec{E}_{(\\text{from +q on outer surface})}$.\n\n8.  **Applying the Shell Theorem:** The shell theorem (a direct result of Gauss's Law) states that the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field of a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   We have a total charge of `+q` uniformly distributed on the outer sphere of radius `R`, centered at O.\n    *   Point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n    *   The magnitude of the electric field at P is therefore the same as that of a point charge `+q` at O.\n    *   $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The specific details about the cavity's location (`s`), its radius (`r`), the distance from P to the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle (`Î¸`) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are extraneous information intended to distract. The external field only depends on the total charge placed inside the cavity and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
