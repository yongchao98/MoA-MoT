    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Substance B**\n\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\nThis temperature is very close to the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\nThis, combined with the initial clue that Substance X contains a \"heavier isotope,\" strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n**2. Identify Precipitate G and the Reaction that Forms B**\n\nSubstance G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of the thermal decomposition of a metal hydroxide (or in this case, a metal deuteroxide). For example, a metal hydroxide decomposes into a metal oxide and water upon heating:\nM(OH)ₓ --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + H₂O\nTherefore, G must be a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes as follows:\nM(OD)ₓ --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + D₂O (Substance B)\n\n**3. Identify Gas W**\n\nGas W is released during the reaction of X and Y. The key property of W is that its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple gases:\n*   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. **(Protons = Neutrons)**. This is a strong candidate, especially since we've already identified D₂O in the reaction pathway.\n*   **¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas):** A ¹⁴N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. An N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. **(Protons = Neutrons)**. This is a possibility.\n*   **¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide):** A ¹²C atom has 6p, 6n. A ¹⁶O atom has 8p, 8n. A CO molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. **(Protons = Neutrons)**. This is also a possibility.\n*   **HD (Hydrogen deuteride):** 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p ≠ n).\n\nGiven that deuterium is clearly involved in the reaction (forming D₂O), D₂ is the most likely candidate for gas W.\n\n**4. Identify Substance X**\n\nWe have several clues about X:\n*   It contains a heavy isotope (Deuterium).\n*   It's a reagent used in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is especially common.\n*   It reacts with a liquid Y to produce a gas W (likely D₂), and a precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide).\n*   The product of its reaction with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. A reaction that reduces it to a product with 2 oxygens would be the reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to form a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which has 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a powerful reducing agent.\n\nA very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its analog containing a heavy isotope is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Let's see if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues.\n\n**5. Verify the Reaction Chemistry with X = LiAlD₄**\n\nLet's assume X is LiAlD₄. It is known to react violently with water. If liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction would be:\nLiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n\nLet's check the products against our deductions:\n*   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂ gas. As established, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (p=n). This fits.\n*   **Precipitate G:** The reaction produces Lithium Deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble in D₂O, and Aluminum Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Aluminum hydroxide is a well-known precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would be the precipitate G. This fits.\n*   **Heating G:** As determined earlier, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would produce an oxide and B (D₂O). This fits.\n*   **Organic Reagent:** LiAlH₄ is a staple in organic synthesis, and LiAlD₄ is its common deuterated analog. This fits.\n*   **Keto Acid Reaction:** LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is strong enough to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols, turning a keto acid into a diol, which has two oxygen atoms. This fits.\n\nAll clues point consistently to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The phrasing \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" indicates we need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Lightest Element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number):** Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   We will use integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes in the molecule: D (²H) has a mass of 2. The most common isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, with a mass of 27.\n\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D).\n    Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al).\n    Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
