    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\nLet's analyze the two given compounds:\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4).\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are the carbons involved in the C=C double bonds (at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are each bonded to another carbon (in the ring) and a hydrogen. Wait, let me re-examine the structure of p-benzoquinone. The formula is C6H4O2. The carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are sp2 hybridized and are part of C=C double bonds. Each of these carbons is bonded to one hydrogen atom. So, there are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   However, for tautomerization to occur, the enol form must be reasonably stable. The enol form of benzoquinone would be hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene). While hydroquinone is a very stable aromatic compound, the conversion from benzoquinone to hydroquinone is a **reduction** (gain of two electrons and two protons), not a simple tautomeric shift. Tautomerism is an isomerization equilibrium (same molecular formula). Benzoquinone (C6H4O2) and hydroquinone (C6H6O2) have different molecular formulas. Therefore, this is not tautomerism. The key point is that the alpha-hydrogens are on sp2 carbons, and removing one to form an enol would disrupt the conjugated system in a way that is not a typical keto-enol tautomerization. The system is already conjugated. The compound is considered non-tautomeric.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered saturated ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons. They are located between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons (CH2 groups) has two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the resulting negative charge after deprotonation can be delocalized over two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Due to the presence of these highly acidic alpha-hydrogens, this compound readily undergoes tautomerization to form its enol isomer, **phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene)**. This enol form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable, so the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism (B)**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** is shown by **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   A common source of chirality is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\nLet's analyze the two given compounds:\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. It also has a center of inversion.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it cannot show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the options provided:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
