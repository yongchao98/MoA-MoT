    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental results and identify the products.**\n\n*   The initial sample is an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, with a total mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Heating this mixture produces only gases.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂, etc. The weight did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ ≈ 32 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the identity of Gas C.**\n\nWe can use the principle of mass conservation. The initial mass of the salts must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Initial mass = 7.20 g\n*   Mass of products = mass(H₂O) + mass(O₂) + mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + mass(Gas C)\n*   mass(Gas C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g\nNow, we can calculate the molar mass (M) of Gas C:\n*   M(Gas C) = mass(Gas C) / moles(Gas C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\nThe gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is unreactive towards Ca(OH)₂ is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nThe products of the decomposition are N₂, O₂, and H₂O. This means the original salts must contain the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). The most common salts that fit this description and decompose into only gaseous products are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, specifically ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. The mixture is equimolar, so let's assume it contains `x` moles of salt A and `x` moles of salt B.\n\nLet's consider the known decomposition reactions for these salts:\n*   **Ammonium nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate:** The decomposition is temperature-dependent. While at ~200°C it typically yields N₂O, at higher temperatures or under certain conditions, it can decompose as follows: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). This reaction produces all three of our identified products.\n\nLet's assume Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃, and they decompose according to these reactions.\nFrom `x` moles of NH₄NO₂:\n*   Moles of N₂ = `x`\n*   Moles of H₂O = `2x`\n\nFrom `x` moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the stoichiometry 1:1:0.5:2 for simplicity):\n*   Moles of N₂ = `x`\n*   Moles of O₂ = `0.5x`\n*   Moles of H₂O = `2x`\n\nNow, let's sum the products from both salts and equate them to our calculated amounts:\n*   **Total N₂:** `x` (from A) + `x` (from B) = `2x`. We know total N₂ is 0.10 mol.\n    *   `2x = 0.10`  =>  `x = 0.05` mol.\n*   **Total O₂:** `0` (from A) + `0.5x` (from B) = `0.5x`. We know total O₂ is 0.025 mol.\n    *   `0.5x = 0.025`  =>  `x = 0.05` mol.\n*   **Total H₂O:** `2x` (from A) + `2x` (from B) = `4x`. We know total H₂O is 0.20 mol.\n    *   `4x = 0.20`  =>  `x = 0.05` mol.\n\nAll three calculations yield `x = 0.05` mol. This consistency confirms our hypothesis. The mixture consists of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Verify the initial mass.**\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass.\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (let's say NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n*   **Total atoms** = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\n# Define molar masses\nM_H2O = 18.0\nM_O2 = 32.0\nV_m_STP = 22.4\n\n# Given data\nmass_mixture = 7.20\nmass_H2O_produced = 3.60\nmass_O2_produced = 0.80\nvol_gas_C = 2.24\n\n# Calculate moles of products\nn_H2O = mass_H2O_produced / M_H2O\nn_O2 = mass_O2_produced / M_O2\nn_C = vol_gas_C / V_m_STP\n\n# Determine molar mass of Gas C\nmass_C = mass_mixture - mass_H2O_produced - mass_O2_produced\nM_C = mass_C / n_C\n# M_C is ~28 g/mol, so Gas C is N2.\n\n# Let x be the number of moles of each salt (NH4NO2 and NH4NO3)\n# From the reaction stoichiometry:\n# Total N2 = x (from NH4NO2) + x (from NH4NO3) = 2x\n# Total O2 = 0.5x (from NH4NO3)\n# Total H2O = 2x (from NH4NO2) + 2x (from NH4NO3) = 4x\n# We can solve for x using any of these. Let's use O2:\n# 0.5 * x = n_O2\nx = n_O2 / 0.5\n\n# Calculate the number of atoms\n# Atoms in NH4NO3 = 2*N + 4*H + 3*O = 9\n# Atoms in NH4NO2 = 2*N + 4*H + 2*O = 8\ntotal_atoms = 9 + 8\n\nprint(f\"The molar mass of Gas C is {M_C:.2f} g/mol, identifying it as N2.\")\nprint(f\"The molar quantity of each salt, x, is {x:.2f} mol.\")\nprint(f\"The total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B is {total_atoms}.\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes a series of steps to analyze the gaseous products from the decomposition of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all other reactive gases are removed, 2.24 L of gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the Identity of Gas C**\n\nWe can use the law of conservation of mass. The initial mass of the salts must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g\n*   Total mass of products = mass(H₂O) + mass(O₂) + mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + mass(Gas C)\n*   mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass (Gas C) = mass(Gas C) / moles(Gas C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is unreactive towards Ca(OH)₂ and hot copper is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products of the decomposition are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the original salts must contain the elements Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N). Since they are salts that decompose into only gases, ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids are the most likely candidates. Let's test the hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n*   **Salt A (e.g., NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Salt B (e.g., NH₄NO₃):** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *(Note: This decomposition of ammonium nitrate occurs at higher temperatures and fits the observed products, unlike the lower-temperature decomposition to N₂O and H₂O).*\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let `x` be the number of moles of each salt.\n\nLet's calculate the total moles of each product based on `x` moles of each salt:\n*   **Total N₂ produced:** `x` (from NH₄NO₂) + `x` (from NH₄NO₃, based on 1:1 ratio from the balanced eq.) = `2x`\n*   **Total O₂ produced:** `0` (from NH₄NO₂) + `0.5x` (from NH₄NO₃, based on 2:1 ratio) = `0.5x`\n*   **Total H₂O produced:** `2x` (from NH₄NO₂) + `2x` (from NH₄NO₃, based on 1:2 ratio) = `4x`\n\nNow, we can solve for `x` using our experimental mole values:\n*   From N₂: 2x = 0.10 mol  =>  x = 0.05 mol\n*   From O₂: 0.5x = 0.025 mol =>  x = 0.05 mol\n*   From H₂O: 4x = 0.20 mol  =>  x = 0.05 mol\n\nAll calculations consistently yield `x = 0.05` mol, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n**4. Verify the Initial Mass**\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ ≈ 80 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ ≈ 64 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass perfectly.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Total atoms** = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n```python\n# This code block verifies the calculations performed in the reasoning steps.\n\n# Given data\nmass_mixture = 7.20  # g\nmass_H2O_increase = 3.60  # g\nmass_O2_increase = 0.80  # g\nvol_gas_C_STP = 2.24  # L\n\n# Molar masses and constants\nM_H2O = 18.0  # g/mol\nM_O2 = 32.0  # g/mol\nV_m_STP = 22.4  # L/mol\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of known products\nn_H2O = mass_H2O_increase / M_H2O\nn_O2 = mass_O2_increase / M_O2\nn_gas_C = vol_gas_C_STP / V_m_STP\n\n# Step 2: Identify Gas C\nmass_gas_C = mass_mixture - mass_H2O_increase - mass_O2_increase\nM_gas_C = mass_gas_C / n_gas_C\n# M_gas_C will be ~28 g/mol, identifying it as N2. So, n_N2 = n_gas_C.\n\n# Step 3: Solve for the equimolar quantity 'x' of the salts NH4NO2 and NH4NO3\n# The decomposition reactions are:\n# x NH4NO2 -> x N2 + 2x H2O\n# x NH4NO3 -> x N2 + 0.5x O2 + 2x H2O\n# Total O2 produced = 0.5x\n# We know n_O2 = 0.025 mol\nx = n_O2 / 0.5\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms in the two salt formulas\natoms_in_NH4NO3 = 2 + 4 + 3  # N, H, O\natoms_in_NH4NO2 = 2 + 4 + 2  # N, H, O\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_NH4NO3 + atoms_in_NH4NO2\n\nprint(f\"The total number of atoms in salts A and B is: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n<<<D>>>",
