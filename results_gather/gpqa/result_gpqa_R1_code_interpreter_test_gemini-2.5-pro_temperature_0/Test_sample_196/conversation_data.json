    "*   **Analysis of Compound X from Spectral Data**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n        *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet (bs) far downfield is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield because it is ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is more upfield, meaning it is ortho to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to both a methyl group and a methine group (-CH).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton, shifted downfield to 2.9 ppm, is characteristic of a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). This proton is part of a methine group (-CH).\n        *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** The signals describe a -CH group (at 2.9 ppm) attached to a -CH₃ group (at 1.4 ppm) and an ethyl group, -CH₂CH₃ (at 1.7 and 0.9 ppm). This entire group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a *sec*-butyl group.\n\n    3.  **Structure of Compound X:**\n        *   Combining all the information, Compound X has a carboxylic acid group and a *sec*-butyl group attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n        *   Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (C).\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n    1.  **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    2.  **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃). It does not affect the aromatic ring or the alkyl substituent under these conditions.\n    3.  **Transformation:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   The -COOH group at position 1 is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n        *   The *sec*-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged.\n    4.  **Final Product:** The final product is 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene, also known as 4-sec-butyltoluene.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    *   The structure of the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n    *   Comparing this with the given options:\n        *   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - **Correct**\n        *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure\n        *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X)\n        *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer (*isobutyl* instead of *sec-butyl*)\n\nThe correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
