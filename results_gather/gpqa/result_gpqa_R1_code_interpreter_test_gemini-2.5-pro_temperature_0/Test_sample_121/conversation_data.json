    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Analysis:** This is an α-halogenation reaction of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group. One of the α-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a variation of the malonic ester synthesis for forming a cyclic compound.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes an acidic α-hydrogen from the carbon between the cyano and ester groups, forming a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining α-hydrogen on the newly substituted carbon.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion on the α-carbon now attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction that forms a six-membered ring, which is thermodynamically favorable.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The resulting molecule is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Structure of Final Product 4:**\n```\n      CN\n      |\n C1 -- C(=O)OCH2CH3\n/  \\\nC6--C2\n|    |\nC5--C3\n \\  /\n  C4\n```\nWhere C1 to C6 form the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo find the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we need to identify all the sets of chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule. The question specifies that we should count all chemically distinct hydrogens, even if their signals might overlap in a real spectrum.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3 (methyl) protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation around the C-C bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2- (methylene) protons:** These two protons are diastereotopic. This is because the carbon they are attached to is linked via the ester group to C1 of the cyclohexane ring, which is a prochiral center (it's bonded to four different groups: CN, COOEt, C2 of the ring, and C6 of the ring). Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will produce two distinct signals. Therefore, this group gives **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The ring has five methylene (CH2) groups. At room temperature, the rapid chair-chair interconversion averages the axial and equatorial environments for each CH2 group. This means the two protons on any single carbon (e.g., C2) become chemically equivalent on the NMR timescale and produce a single signal.\n    *   Now we must compare the different CH2 groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) to see which are equivalent.\n    *   The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different. This lack of symmetry means that the environment on one side of the ring is different from the other.\n    *   **C2 vs. C6:** C2 is adjacent to C1. C6 is also adjacent to C1. However, there is no plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4 because the substituents are different. Therefore, the protons on C2 are in a different chemical environment than the protons on C6. They are non-equivalent.\n    *   **C3 vs. C5:** C3 is adjacent to C2, while C5 is adjacent to C6. Since C2 and C6 are non-equivalent, C3 and C5 are also non-equivalent.\n    *   **C4:** The C4 position is unique.\n    *   Therefore, all five methylene groups on the ring are in chemically distinct environments. This results in **5 signals** from the ring protons.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl -CH3 group: 1 signal\n*   From the ethyl -OCH2- group: 2 signals\n*   From the five ring -CH2- groups: 5 signals\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<D>>>"
