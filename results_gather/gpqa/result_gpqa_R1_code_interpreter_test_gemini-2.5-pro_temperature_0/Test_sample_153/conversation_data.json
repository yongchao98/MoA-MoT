    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weight of the options, all of which are isomers with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   MW = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 35 + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   All options match the molecular weight and the presence of one chlorine atom. We must use the other spectral data to differentiate them.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very distinctive feature. A very broad absorption in this region is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids:\n    *   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. Ruled out.\n    *   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester/acid chloride derivative. It lacks the O-H group for the broad peak. Ruled out.\n    *   We are left with **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** and **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**, both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**). The 's' indicates it is a singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with), and '1H' confirms it represents a single proton. This is consistent with both remaining options (B and D).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The pattern in the aromatic region is the key to distinguishing between the remaining isomers.\n    *   We see two signals: a doublet at 8.02 ppm integrating to 2H, and another doublet at 7.72 ppm integrating to 2H.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic signature of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. Due to the symmetry of the para-substitution, there are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to one substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   **Let's analyze the remaining options:**\n        *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho* (1,2) substituted ring. The four aromatic protons would all be in different chemical environments, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four distinct signals), not two simple doublets.\n        *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para* (1,4) substituted ring. This substitution pattern perfectly matches the observed NMR data of two doublets, each for 2H. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom appear slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll three pieces of spectral data are consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **MS:** MW of 156 and one Cl atom.\n*   **IR:** Confirms a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, crucially, the *para* substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nTherefore, the unidentified solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
