    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to find its molecular formula and initial IHD.\n\n*   **Parent structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH) at position 1.\n    *   `formyl` (-CHO) at position 2.\n    *   `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂) at position 5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula (CₓHᵧO₂) by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH₂ = **10 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Let's count them on the structure.\n    *   C1: 1 H (attached to the ring)\n    *   C2: 1 H (attached to the ring)\n    *   C3: 1 H (part of the double bond)\n    *   C4: 1 H (part of the double bond)\n    *   C5: 1 H (attached to the ring)\n    *   C6: 2 H\n    *   -COOH: 1 H\n    *   -CHO: 1 H\n    *   -CH=CH₂: 3 H\n    *   Total H = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = **3 oxygens**.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated for the reactant using the formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n(Oxygen atoms do not affect the IHD calculation).\nIHD_reactant = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the rings and pi (π) bonds in the structure:\n*   1 ring = 1 IHD\n*   1 C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring = 1 IHD\n*   1 C=C bond in the vinyl group = 1 IHD\n*   1 C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group = 1 IHD\n*   1 C=O bond in the formyl group = 1 IHD\n*   Total IHD_reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its key function is to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes.\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces alkenes (C=C) to alkanes (C-C).\n*   It removes all oxygen atoms from the molecule.\n*   Crucially, it **does not break** the carbon ring structure.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction will perform the following transformations on the reactant:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring will be reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond becomes a C-C bond).\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) will be reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n*   The `formyl` group (-CHO) will be reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n*   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) will be reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule is preserved (10 carbon atoms). All the double bonds and oxygen-containing groups are removed, leaving a saturated hydrocarbon with one ring. The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n\nSince the product is a **monocyclic alkane** (an alkane containing one ring), its general molecular formula is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\nThe product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), so its molecular formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Calculate the IHD of the Product**\n\nWe can now calculate the IHD for the product with the formula C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the product molecule.\n# The reactant C10H12O3 is fully reduced by Red P/HI.\n# All pi bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed.\n# The C10 carbon skeleton and the single ring remain.\n# The product is a monocyclic alkane with the formula CnH2n.\n# For n=10, the product is C10H20.\nC = 10\nH = 20\n\n# Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n# The formula for IHD is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nihd = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n\n# Print the result as an integer.\nprint(int(ihd))\n```\n\nThe IHD of the product is calculated as follows:\nIHD_product = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD_product = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\nIHD_product = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can deduce the IHD from the product's structure. The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains **one ring** and **zero pi bonds**.\nIHD = (number of rings) + (number of pi bonds)\nIHD_product = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>",

So, `5 = (2*10 + 2 - H) / 2` => `10 = 22 - H` => `H = 12`.\n*   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**2.

    "The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product is 1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Its molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n2.  **Reagent and Reaction:** The reagent is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P/HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent that performs the following transformations:\n    *   Reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups (like carboxylic acids and aldehydes) completely to alkanes. The -COOH and -CHO groups are both reduced to -CH₃ groups.\n    *   Reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) to single bonds (alkanes). The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the vinyl group are both saturated.\n    *   The reaction does not break the carbon ring structure.\n3.  **Product:** The reaction removes all double bonds and all oxygen atoms, leaving a saturated hydrocarbon that retains the original ring structure.\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` core becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n    *   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n    *   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since the carbon skeleton is preserved, the product has 10 carbon atoms. As it is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane), its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀.\n4.  **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) Calculation:** The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) represents the number of rings and/or pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **Method 1: From the structure.** The product is a cyclohexane derivative. It has one ring and no π bonds. Therefore, IHD = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for π bonds) = 1.\n    *   **Method 2: From the molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀).** The formula for IHD is `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n        IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
