    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetric, the two α-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents applied to an α-halo ketone that has a proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-position) leads to a classic named reaction called the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate then performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic ketone intermediate (bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, breaking the bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the α'-carbon (C6) to relieve the strain of the three-membered ring. This ring-opening step forms a carbanion.\n    5.  Protonation of the carbanion (upon acidic workup, which is implicit) yields a carboxylic acid with a contracted ring system.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. The six-membered ring has contracted to a five-membered ring.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. SOCl₂ is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a bulky, mild reducing agent. A key characteristic of LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is its ability to selectively reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol. This is a standard transformation taught in organic chemistry.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n```\n      O\n     //\n    C — H(a)\n    |\n   /C1\\ — H(b)\nH-C2--C5-H\n| |  | |\nH-C3--C4-H\n  \\----/\n```\n\nTo count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the C1 carbon of the ring, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Proton (H_a):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. It is the only aldehyde proton. This is **1 type**.\n2.  **Methine Proton on C1 (H_b):** This proton is attached to the carbon (C1) that links the ring to the aldehyde group. It is also unique. This is **1 type**.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, carbon C2 is equivalent to carbon C5. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other. They are **diastereotopic** because of their spatial relationship to the substituent on the prochiral C1 carbon. The same applies to C5. Therefore, the protons on C2 and C5 give rise to **2 distinct types** of hydrogen signals.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes carbon C3 equivalent to carbon C4. The two protons on C3 are also **diastereotopic**. This gives another **2 distinct types** of hydrogen signals.\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Aldehyde H: 1 type\n*   C1-H: 1 type\n*   C2/C5 Protons: 2 types\n*   C3/C4 Protons: 2 types\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nThis corresponds to the number of signals one would expect to see in the ¹H NMR spectrum of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<A>>>"
