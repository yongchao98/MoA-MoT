    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemical Equilibrium:** The problem involves the equilibrium between the calcium-EDTA complex ($[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$) and its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($EDTA^{4-}$). The reaction for the formation of the complex is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   Initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex, $[Ca-EDTA]_{initial} = 0.02$ M.\n    *   The formation constant (stability constant), $K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    *   The problem assumes an \"ideal pH,\" which means we can use the given formation constant directly without considering the protonation of EDTA (i.e., we can use $[EDTA^{4-}]$ in the equilibrium expression).\n\n3.  **Set up the Equilibrium Expression:** The formation constant is defined as:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}$\n\n4.  **Consider the Dissociation:** Since we start with the complex, it will dissociate to a small extent to reach equilibrium. Let's write the dissociation reaction:\n    $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n5.  **Use an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n    From the table, at equilibrium:\n    *   $[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$\n    *   $[Ca^{2+}] = x$\n    *   $[EDTA^{4-}] = x$\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression:** Now, we plug these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n7.  **Apply an Approximation:** The formation constant ($5 \\times 10^{10}$) is very large. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n8.  **Solve for x:** The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n\n    Now, we can use a calculator or a simple script to find the value of x.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# From the simplified equation: x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\n\n# Solve for x, which represents the concentration of Ca2+\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\n6.32e-07\n</execute_output>\n\n9.  **Interpret the Result:** The calculation shows that $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. Since we defined 'x' as the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$, we have:\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n10. **Check the Approximation:** We assumed that x is much smaller than 0.02.\n    $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ is indeed much, much smaller than 0.02, so our approximation was valid.\n\n11. **Compare with Options:** The calculated concentration matches option B.\n    A) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    B) 6.3x10^-7 M\n    C) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    D) 2.0x10^-2 M\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Reaction and Equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex is very stable, but it will dissociate slightly in solution to establish an equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Formation Constant ($K_f$):** We are given the formation constant, which corresponds to the formation reaction ($Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$):\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **ICE Table:** We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression:** Now we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Approximation:** The formation constant ($K_f$) is extremely large, which means the equilibrium strongly favors the complex. Therefore, the amount that dissociates, 'x', will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the simplifying assumption that:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n6.  **Solve for x:** The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Rearranging to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Now, solve for x by taking the square root:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** From the ICE table, 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nThis value matches option B. The python code execution also confirmed this result ($6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$).\n\n<<<B>>>"
