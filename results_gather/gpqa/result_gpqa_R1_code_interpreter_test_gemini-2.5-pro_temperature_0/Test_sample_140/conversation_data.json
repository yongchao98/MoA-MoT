    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH2) in a suitable solvent (liquid ammonia, NH3). This is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) is a strong base that abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Position 6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position 2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than the C-D bond. However, both reactions are possible and will occur. This leads to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6. The resulting carbanion then loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at C-2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2. The resulting carbanion then loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n          -> This link is a placeholder, the description is what matters. Let's describe it:\n        1-bromobenzene-2-d reacts with NH2-. The base abstracts D from C2, forming a carbanion at C2. Then Br- leaves from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. The resulting benzyne has no deuterium.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2⁻), now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to yield the final aniline products.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (from 3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        The nucleophile (NH2⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C-1 or C-6).\n        1.  **Attack at C-1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C-6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-6. A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber the ring to prioritize the -NH2 group at position 1, the deuterium is now at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        So, Pathway A produces two distinct products: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (from non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        The nucleophile (NH2⁻) attacks the non-deuterated benzyne (triple bond between C-1 and C-2).\n        1.  **Attack at C-1 or C-2:** Due to the symmetry of this intermediate, attack at either C-1 or C-2, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2), which has no deuterium.\n        So, Pathway B produces one product: aniline.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    By considering both possible elimination pathways, we find a total of three unique organic products that can be formed:\n    1.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n    2.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
