    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle $X^0$. In a bubble chamber, \"observing a decay\" means being able to distinguish the decay point (vertex) from the production point. This requires the particle to travel a distance, $d$, greater than the detector's resolution, $L$. Therefore, we need to find the distance $L$ such that at least 30% of the particles travel this distance or more before decaying.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Time Dilation:** The particle $X^0$ is moving at a relativistic speed. Its lifetime in the lab frame (the bubble chamber), $\\tau$, is longer than its proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$, due to time dilation. The relationship is:\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor can be calculated from the particle's total energy ($E$) and its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n    $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$\n    Given:\n    $E = 27 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $m_0c^2 = 3.41 \\text{ GeV}$\n    \n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41}$\n\n4.  **Decay Law and Decay Length:** The number of particles $N(t)$ that survive after a time $t$ in the lab frame follows an exponential decay law:\n    $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau}$\n    The distance traveled by a particle before it decays is $d = v \\cdot t$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity. The probability of a particle traveling a distance greater than $L$ is equivalent to the probability of it surviving for a time longer than $t = L/v$.\n    $P(d > L) = e^{-L/(v\\tau)}$\n    The term $v\\tau$ is the mean decay length, $\\lambda$, which is the average distance a particle travels before decaying in the lab frame.\n    $\\lambda = v\\tau$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** A convenient formula for the mean decay length relates it to the particle's momentum ($p$) and proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$):\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c\\tau_0$\n    We can find the momentum-energy term $pc$ from the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = 27^2 - 3.41^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} \\text{ GeV}$\n\n6.  **Set up the Final Equation:** We need to find the resolution $L$ such that the probability of the decay distance being greater than $L$ is 30% (0.3).\n    $P(d > L) = e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.3$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{L}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.3)$\n    $L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.3)$\n\n7.  **Calculation:** Now, we'll substitute the values and calculate $L$. We can use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458.0  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the momentum term pc\npc = np.sqrt(E**2 - m0c2**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length (lambda)\nmean_decay_length = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\n\n# We need to observe at least 30% of the decays, which means the track length\n# must be greater than the resolution L for at least 30% of particles.\n# P(d > L) = 0.3\n# exp(-L / lambda) = 0.3\n# L = -lambda * ln(0.3)\npercentage_to_observe = 0.3\nL = -mean_decay_length * np.log(percentage_to_observe)\n\nprint(f\"{L:.3e}\")\n```\nThe execution of the code gives the following result:\n`2.268e-06`\n\nThe calculated minimum resolution is $L \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nOur calculated value is $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is the closest value. The small discrepancy might be due to slightly different constants used or a minor inaccuracy in the problem statement's values. If the resolution were $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, the fraction of observed decays would be $e^{-2.08/2.268} \\approx e^{-0.917} \\approx 0.399$, or about 40%, which satisfies the \"at least 30%\" condition.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution, let's call it $L$, required to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle $X^0$. In a detector like a bubble chamber, \"observing a decay\" means that the particle travels a distance $d$ that is greater than the detector's spatial resolution $L$. Therefore, we need to find the distance $L$ such that the probability of the particle traveling a distance $d > L$ is at least 0.30.\n\n### 2. Relativistic Effects\nThe particle $X^0$ is moving at a relativistic speed, so its lifetime in the lab frame (the bubble chamber) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime in the lab frame is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This is calculated from the total energy $E$ and the rest mass energy $m_0c^2$ using the relation $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$.\n    *   Given: $E = 27$ GeV, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41}$.\n\n### 3. Exponential Decay and Decay Length\nThe decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle survives for a time $t$ in the lab frame is $P(t) = e^{-t/\\tau}$.\n*   The distance traveled is $d = v \\cdot t$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n*   The probability of a particle traveling a distance greater than $L$ before decaying is equivalent to the probability of it surviving for a time longer than $t = L/v$.\n*   This probability is given by $P(d > L) = e^{-L/(v\\tau)}$.\n*   The term $v\\tau$ is the **mean decay length**, denoted by $\\lambda$. It represents the average distance a particle travels before decaying in the lab frame.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\nA convenient formula for the mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0}\\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2}c\\tau_0$, where $p$ is the momentum of the particle.\n*   We can find the momentum term $pc$ from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n*   Solving for $pc$: $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2}$ GeV.\n\n### 5. Finding the Required Resolution ($L$)\nWe need to find the resolution $L$ such that at least 30% of the particles are observed. This sets the condition:\n$P(d > L) \\ge 0.30$\n$e^{-L/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum required resolution (which corresponds to the largest possible value of $L$ that satisfies the condition), we solve for the equality:\n$e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{L}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30)$\n$L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### 6. Numerical Calculation\nWe can now substitute all the values and calculate $L$. A Python script is ideal for this to maintain precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458.0  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the momentum term (pc) in units of GeV\npc = np.sqrt(E**2 - m0c2**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in meters\n# The formula is lambda = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\nmean_decay_length = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\n\n# We need to find the resolution L such that P(d > L) = 0.3\n# This means exp(-L / lambda) = 0.3\n# Solving for L gives L = -lambda * ln(0.3)\nfraction_to_observe = 0.3\nL = -mean_decay_length * np.log(fraction_to_observe)\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation with 4 significant figures\nprint(f\"{L:.4e}\")\n```\nThe code execution will calculate the value of L. Based on the previous run, the output is approximately $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### 7. Conclusion\nThe calculation yields $L \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This is the maximum resolution (i.e., the largest distinguishable distance) that would allow at least 30% of the decays to be observed. Any resolution value smaller than this would be sufficient.\n\nLet's compare this result with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThe calculated value $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is very close to option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The other options are different by several orders of magnitude. The small difference between the calculated value and option D is likely due to rounding of constants in the problem's design. A resolution of $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is smaller than the calculated threshold of $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, so it satisfies the condition of observing *at least* 30% of the decays.\n\n<<<D>>>",
