    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a **Michael addition** reaction. It involves the addition of a nucleophile (an enolate) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor).\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This will form the enolate.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base used to deprotonate the ketone and form the enolate.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n\n2.  **Formation of the enolate:** The base removes an acidic α-proton from the ketone. The ketone has two α-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6, forming a single, specific enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **The Michael addition step:** The enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   **Nucleophile:** The enolate of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one (attack occurs from C6).\n    *   **Electrophile:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). The attack happens at the β-carbon (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. The product, after workup (protonation), will have a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to C6.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting product is a cyclohexanone derivative with the following substituents:\n        *   C1: Carbonyl group (C=O)\n        *   C2: An ethyl group and a methyl group\n        *   C6: A methyl group and a `-(CH₂)-CH₂-COOEt` (2-ethoxycarbonylethyl) group.\n    *   To determine the correct IUPAC name from the options, we can name the product by treating the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain.\n        *   The main chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n        *   The cyclohexanone ring is attached to the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n        *   Now, we name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain is designated as C1' of the ring. We then number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants.\n        *   C1' (the point of attachment, our original C6) has a methyl group.\n        *   Numbering from C1' towards the carbonyl group gives the lowest locants: C2' is the carbonyl carbon (oxo), and C3' has the ethyl and methyl groups.\n        *   So, the substituent is named: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a **Michael addition**.\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the α-protons (on C1) acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion).\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n\n2.  **Formation of the nucleophile:** KOH removes a proton from C1 of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   `CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂ + OH⁻  ⇌  CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂ + H₂O`\n\n3.  **The Michael addition step:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Nucleophile:** `CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`\n    *   **Electrophile:** `CH₃(β)-CH(α)=CH-CN`. The attack occurs at the β-carbon (C3 of the butene chain).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The initial adduct is protonated by water to give the final product.\n    *   The structure is: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃) - CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1. The chain is 6 carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon (C1).\n        *   `CH₃(C6)-CH₂(C5)-CH(NO₂)(C4)-CH(CH₃)(C3)-CH₂(C2)-CN(C1)`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Listing the substituents alphabetically, the IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find that they match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
