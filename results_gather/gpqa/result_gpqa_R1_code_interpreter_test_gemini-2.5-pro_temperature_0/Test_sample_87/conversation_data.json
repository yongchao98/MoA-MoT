    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on a set of experimental observations. Let's break down the key pieces of information provided:\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (the antigen) are delivered orally.\n2.  **Antigen Location:** The antigen is found in Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut. This is where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated.\n3.  **Cellular Response:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated from these Peyer's patches. This indicates an active immune response, specifically clonal expansion of lymphocytes that recognize the antigen.\n4.  **Genetic Analysis:** The \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these proliferating cells is sequenced. This points towards B cells, as they are the cells that have variable heavy chain genes that encode for antibodies.\n5.  **Key Observation:** \"High variability\" is observed in this gene region among the population of cells.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options in the context of these observations:\n\n*   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which determines the antibody's effector function. It does *not* alter the *variable* region, which is responsible for antigen binding. The observation is high variability in the *variable* region, so this is not the primary process described.\n\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that initially assembles the variable region gene in *developing* B cells within the *primary* lymphoid organs (like the bone marrow). This happens *before* a B cell ever encounters an antigen. The experiment describes a response in mature B cells that are already in a *secondary* lymphoid organ and are proliferating *after* encountering an antigen. Therefore, VDJ recombination has already been completed for these cells.\n\n*   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs specifically in activated B cells that are proliferating within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). It introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the genes encoding the *variable regions* of the antibody heavy and light chains. This creates a diverse pool of B cells, some of which will have higher affinity for the antigen. This process of mutation and subsequent selection (affinity maturation) perfectly explains the finding of \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of a \"proliferating cell population\" in a Peyer's patch following antigen exposure.\n\n*   **D) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system involving a cascade of plasma proteins. It does not involve any genetic changes to B cells or their antibody genes.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in a secondary lymphoid organ after antigen challenge is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
