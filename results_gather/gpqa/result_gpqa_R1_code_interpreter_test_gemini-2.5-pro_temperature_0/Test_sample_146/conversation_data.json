    "This problem involves the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton, which is governed by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Setup**\n\n*   **Initial State:** We have a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of annihilation where massive amounts of energy are released, \"slowly moving\" implies that the kinetic energies of the initial particles are negligible compared to their rest mass energies. Therefore, we can assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   The antiproton has the same rest mass energy, $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2$.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of their rest mass energies:\n        $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    *   Since the particles are at rest, the total initial momentum ($P_i$) is zero.\n\n*   **Final State:** The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   The rest mass energy of each particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   These four particles will move away with high velocities. Let the velocity of each particle A be $v_A$.\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   By symmetry, all four resulting particles will have the same speed $v_A$ and thus the same total energy, $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n        $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\n\n*   **Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total final momentum must be zero ($P_f = P_i = 0$). This means the four particles fly off in such a way that their momentum vectors sum to zero.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy must equal the total final energy ($E_i = E_f$).\n        $2 \\times m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\n\n**2. Calculation**\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$.\n\n$ \\gamma_A = \\frac{2 \\times m_p c^2}{4 \\times m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 \\times m_A c^2} $\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n$ \\gamma_A = \\frac{938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638 $\n\nNow, we relate the Lorentz factor to the velocity $v_A$. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n\n$ \\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} $\n\nRearranging to solve for $\\beta$:\n\n$ \\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2} $\n$ 1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2} $\n$ \\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2} $\n$ \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}} $\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma_A$:\n\n$ \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688 $\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v_A = 0.7688c$.\n\nTo ensure precision, let's perform the calculation with a script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.27  # Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300     # Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# From conservation of energy: 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma_A * m_A_c2\n# Solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma_A\ngamma_A = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Solve for beta (v/c) from the definition of the Lorentz factor\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_A^2)\nbeta = np.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_A**2)\n\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 0.91c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.86c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Physical Principles**\n\nThe core principles governing this particle annihilation process are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the resulting particles will be moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of annihilation, where the energy released from converting mass is enormous, the initial kinetic energy of the particles is negligible compared to their rest mass energy. Therefore, we can assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   Since the particles are considered to be at rest, the total initial momentum ($P_{initial}$) is zero.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State**\n\n*   The final system consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. All these particles have the same rest mass, $m_A$.\n*   The rest mass energy of each particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum ($P_{final}$) must also be zero. This implies that the four particles fly off in such a way that their momentum vectors cancel out.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the final state (four identical mass particles), we can conclude that they will all have the same speed, $v_A$, and therefore the same total energy, $E_A$.\n*   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$.\n*   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nSet the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$2 \\times m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\n\n**5. Solve for the Velocity ($v_A$)**\n\nFirst, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n$\\gamma_A = \\frac{2 \\times m_p c^2}{4 \\times m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 \\times m_A c^2}$\n\nSubstitute the known energy values:\n$\\gamma_A = \\frac{938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nNow, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n$\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for $\\beta$:\n$\\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the calculated value of $\\gamma_A$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is $v_A = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
