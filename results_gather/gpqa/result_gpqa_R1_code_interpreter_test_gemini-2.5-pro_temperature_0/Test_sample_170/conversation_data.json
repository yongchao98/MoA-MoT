    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order:\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) based on its effect on electrophilic substitution. Substituents can be either activating (and ortho,para-directing) or deactivating (and mostly meta-directing, with the exception of halogens).\n\n*   **Activating, ortho,para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n\n*   **Deactivating, meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n*   **Deactivating, ortho,para-directing group:** Halogens are a special case. They are deactivating due to their strong inductive effect but are ortho,para-directing due to their resonance effect. They will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n**Step 2: Separate into low-yield and high-yield groups**\nBased on the directing effects, we can immediately say that the meta-directing substances will have a much lower yield of the para-isomer than the ortho,para-directing substances.\n\n*   **Low para-yield group:** 2, 4, 6\n*   **High para-yield group:** 1, 3, 5\n\nThe final order will look like: (Order of 2, 4, 6) < (Order of 1, 3, 5).\n\n**Step 3: Order the low-yield (meta-directing) group**\nFor meta-directors, the amount of para-isomer formed is very small. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, leaving less for the para position.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The -COOH group is a stronger deactivator than the -COOC2H5 (ester) group because the electron-donating ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing ability.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n    *   **4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5)**\n\n**Step 4: Order the high-yield (ortho,para-directing) group**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is the size (steric bulk) of the alkyl group. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is larger than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene will give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5)**\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) has a very strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect. This effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor leads to a very high preference for para substitution, even more so than for alkylbenzenes. The yield of para-bromochlorobenzene is typically very high (around 85-90%).\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene gives the highest yield of the para-isomer in this group.\n    *   **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the groups for the final order**\nBy combining the orders from Step 3 and Step 4, we get the final arrangement from lowest to highest para-isomer yield.\n\n*   (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
