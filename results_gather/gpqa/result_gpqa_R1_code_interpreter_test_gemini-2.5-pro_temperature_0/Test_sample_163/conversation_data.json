    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the total mass of system 1 (M1_total) to the total mass of system 2 (M2_total). This can be expressed as the factor `M1_total / M2_total`.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K1_1) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K1_2) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K2_1) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K2_2) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   The problem involves binary star systems with observed radial velocities and orbital periods. This points to the use of Kepler's Third Law as applied to spectroscopic binaries.\n    *   For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the sum of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 + K2) by the following formula:\n        `M_total * sin^3(i) = (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K1 + K2)^3`\n        where `i` is the orbital inclination and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Incorporate a Key Assumption:**\n    *   The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing\".

    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses, M_total_1 / M_total_2.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2) using a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law. The formula is:\n\nM_total = (P / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))) * (K1 + K2)³\n\nwhere:\n*   `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n**2. Use the \"Eclipsing\" Information**\nThe problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing\". For eclipses to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the stars. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\nWhen `i = 90°`, `sin(i) = 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) = 1`. This simplifies the mass formula significantly:\n\nM_total ≈ (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio**\nWe want to find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2.\n\nM_total_1 = (P1 / (2 * π * G)) * (K1_1 + K1_2)³\nM_total_2 = (P2 / (2 * π * G)) * (K2_1 + K2_2)³\n\nWhen we divide M_total_1 by M_total_2, the constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` cancels out:\n\nRatio = M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1_1 + K1_2) / (K2_1 + K2_2) ]³\n\n**4. Substitute the Given Values**\n\n*   **For System 1:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **For System 2:**\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio**\nNow, we plug these values into the ratio formula. The units (years for period, km/s for velocity) are consistent between the two systems, so they will cancel out, and we don't need to convert them to SI units.\n\nRatio = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\nRatio = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nRatio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nRatio = 54 / 125\n\nTo get the decimal value, we perform the division. The Python code from the thinking process has already calculated this.\n\nThe calculation `54 / 125` yields `0.432`.\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\nThe calculated factor is 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 0.4\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
