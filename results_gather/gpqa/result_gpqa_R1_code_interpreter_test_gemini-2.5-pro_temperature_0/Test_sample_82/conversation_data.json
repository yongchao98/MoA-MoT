    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume (V2) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   The new concentration (M2) is calculated using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n    *   (0.05 M) * (20.00 cm³) = M2 * (40.00 cm³)\n    *   M2 = (0.05 * 20.00) / 40.00 = 0.025 M\n*   So, the concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains.\n*   The solution at this point is a buffer, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   The ratio of [A⁻]/[HA] is the ratio of their moles, which is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) - log(3)\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   First, determine the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point (Veq). At this point, moles of acid = moles of base.\n    *   Moles of acid = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.0400 L = 0.001 moles\n    *   Veq = Moles of acid / Concentration of base = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to sodium acetate. The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the acid plus the volume of NaOH added.\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion ([A⁻]) is:\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles of acetate / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and hydrolyzes in water: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻.\n*   We need to find the concentration of OH⁻ to calculate the pH. We use the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   The equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis is Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻]. Let [OH⁻] = x.\n    *   Kb = x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   x² = Kb × 0.02\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb × 0.02)\n*   Once [OH⁻] is found, we can calculate pOH and then pH.\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻])\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n\nTo get the precise numerical values, we can use a python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% titration ---\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# Calculate pH at 25% titration\n# At 25% titration, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at equivalence point ---\n# Constants\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# Initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution\nCa_diluted = 0.025 # M\n\n# Initial volume of diluted acetic acid\nVa_diluted = 40.0 # cm3\n\n# Concentration of NaOH\nCb = 0.1 # M\n\n# Moles of acid (in moles)\nmoles_acid = Ca_diluted * (Va_diluted / 1000)\n\n# Volume of NaOH at equivalence point (Veq) in L\nVeq = moles_acid / Cb\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point in L\nV_total = (Va_diluted / 1000) + Veq\n\n# Concentration of acetate [A-] at equivalence point\nconc_A_minus = moles_acid / V_total\n\n# Calculate Kb\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] concentration\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-], so [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThe calculated pH values are 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   The initial solution of acetic acid has a concentration (M₁) of 0.05 M and a volume (V₁) of 20.00 cm³.\n*   It is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, so the final volume (V₂) is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration (M₂).\n*   M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n*   So, the concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted.\n*   The solution at this point is a buffer, containing both the weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A⁻). We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   The ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base to the acid, [A⁻]/[HA], is equal to the ratio of their moles. At 25% titration, this ratio is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, we plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - log(3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.26\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (NaA). The solution contains only the conjugate base, A⁻.\n*   First, we find the moles of acetic acid:\n    *   Moles HA = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = moles of HA = 0.001 mol.\n*   Next, we find the volume of NaOH added:\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is the initial volume of the diluted acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion [A⁻] is:\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and hydrolyzes in water: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻.\n*   We need to find the concentration of OH⁻. We use the base dissociation constant, Kb, which is related to Ka by the ion product of water, Kw (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C).\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   We set up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis: Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻]. Let x = [OH⁻].\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Now we can calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. This matches the values in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
