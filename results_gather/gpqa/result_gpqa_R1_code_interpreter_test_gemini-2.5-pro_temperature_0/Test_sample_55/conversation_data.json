    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Transition Process:**\n    The problem describes a two-step decay process for a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The transitions are specified as electric dipole transitions.\n\n2.  **Apply Dipole Selection Rules:**\n    Electric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State(s):**\n    Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n        *   From $l=0$, we must have $\\Delta l = +1$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   From $m=0$, we can have $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, so $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   For decay, $n' < 3$. The most probable transitions are to the nearest lower energy level, so we consider $n'=2$.\n        *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Let's check if a transition from our possible intermediate states to the final state is allowed.\n        *   From $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n            *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n            *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This is allowed if $m' \\in \\{0, \\pm 1\\}$.\n        *   So, all three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n    The possible decay routes are:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of the Routes:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios at each step.\n    *   $P(\\text{route}) = B(\\text{step 1}) \\times B(\\text{step 2})$\n\n    *   **Step 1: Branching Ratios for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n        The rate of a transition from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: $\\Gamma_{i \\to f} \\propto |\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n        The branching ratio for a specific final state $|f_k\\rangle$ is $B_k = \\frac{\\Gamma_{i \\to f_k}}{\\sum_j \\Gamma_{i \\to f_j}}$.\n\n        We need to compare the rates for the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the three possible intermediate states $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. Since the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (it's an s-orbital with $l=0, m=0$), it has no preferred direction in space. Consequently, the transitions to the three degenerate sub-levels of the $l'=1$ state must be equally probable.\n\n        Let's verify this with the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The transition amplitude is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m' \\rangle$.\n        For the first transition, we have $|l,m\\rangle = |0,0\\rangle$ and $|l',m'\\rangle = |1,m'\\rangle$. The transition operator is a rank-1 tensor (dipole), so we look at $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$.\n        *   For $m'=0$: $\\langle 0,0; 1,0 | 1,0 \\rangle = 1$\n        *   For $m'=1$: $\\langle 0,0; 1,1 | 1,1 \\rangle = 1$\n        *   For $m'=-1$: $\\langle 0,0; 1,-1 | 1,-1 \\rangle = 1$\n\n        Since the squared Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are all equal to $1^2=1$, and the radial part of the matrix element and the frequency term ($\\omega^3$) are the same for all three transitions, the rates are equal:\n        $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle)$.\n\n        The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of these three rates. Therefore, the branching ratio for each of these three channels is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n        $B(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Branching Ratio for $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        The intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ (the $2p_z$ state) can only decay to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an electric dipole transition. There are no other allowed decay channels to lower energy states. Therefore, any atom that reaches the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with 100% probability.\n        $B(|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Overall Probability:**\n    The probability for the route specified in options A and C is:\n    $P = B(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times B(|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Incorrect probability)\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (The probability for this route is also $\\frac{1}{3}$, so this option is incorrect).\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Correct route and correct probability).\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (The probability for this route is also $\\frac{1}{3}$, so this option is incorrect).\n\nThe only option that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability is C.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\n\n# The relative probability of the first transition |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m'> is\n# proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <0,0; 1,m' | 1,m'>.\n# The radial integral part is the same for all m'.\n\n# For m' = 0\ncg0 = CG(0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0).doit()\nprob0 = cg0**2\n\n# For m' = 1\ncg1 = CG(0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1).doit()\nprob1 = cg1**2\n\n# For m' = -1\ncg_1 = CG(0, 0, 1, -1, 1, -1).doit()\nprob_1 = cg_1**2\n\n# The rates are proportional to these probabilities.\n# The total rate is proportional to the sum.\ntotal_relative_rate = prob0 + prob1 + prob_1\n\n# The branching ratio for the m'=0 channel is its rate divided by the total rate.\nbranching_ratio_m0 = prob0 / total_relative_rate\n\n# The second step of the cascade, |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0>, is the only dipole-allowed\n# decay path for the |2,1,0> state, so its branching ratio is 1.\n# The total probability for the route is the branching ratio of the first step.\ntotal_probability = branching_ratio_m0 * 1\n\nprint(f\"The probability for the route |3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0> is {total_probability}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the correct decay route and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole transitions.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Selection Rules:**\n    Electric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers $|n,l,m\\rangle$:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the First Transition:**\n    The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules for the first transition:\n        *   $l_{initial} = 0$, so we must have $\\Delta l = +1$, which means $l' = 1$.\n        *   $m_{initial} = 0$, so we can have $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, which means $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   $n_{initial} = 3$, so $n'$ must be less than 3. The most probable transitions are to the next lowest principal quantum number, so we consider $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Second Transition:**\n    The final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's check if a transition from our possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state is allowed.\n    *   Applying the selection rules for the second transition:\n        *   $l_{intermediate} = 1$ and $l_{final} = 0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n        *   $m_{final} = 0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n    *   This confirms that all three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The possible decay routes are:\n        *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    We need to find the probability of the specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. The total probability is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio of the First Step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. Consequently, the decay to the three degenerate p-sublevels ($|2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$) must be equally probable.\n        The total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $n=2, l=1$ level is the sum of the rates to the three sub-levels. Since the rates are equal, the probability (or branching ratio) of decaying into any one specific sub-level, such as $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n        So, the branching ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio of the Second Step ($|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n        Once the atom is in the state $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it needs to decay to a lower energy state. The only available lower energy state is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The transition $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed by the dipole selection rules ($\\Delta l = -1, \\Delta m = 0$). Since this is the only possible decay channel, any atom that reaches the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of 1.\n        So, the branching ratio for $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is $1$.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the individual branching ratios:\n        $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The correct transition route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and the corresponding probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
