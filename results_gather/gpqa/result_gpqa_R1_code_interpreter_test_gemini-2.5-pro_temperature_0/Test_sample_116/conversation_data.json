    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism.\n\n**Understanding Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or the presence of an axis of chirality (as seen in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative, meaning it consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Substituents:** All four positions adjacent to the linking bond (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky substituents: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The presence of these large groups at all four *ortho* positions creates significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them.\n    *   This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   Because the substitution pattern on each ring is asymmetric (e.g., a -COOCH3 at position 2 and a -NO2 at position 6), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   This combination of restricted rotation and lack of symmetry results in a type of chirality known as **axial chirality**, and the resulting isomers are called **atropisomers**.\n    *   Since the molecule is chiral, it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is an ester derived from lactic acid. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   We need to look for a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four of these groups are different, this carbon atom is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a simple aromatic ketone with the formula (C6H5)2C=O. Two phenyl rings are attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbon is sp2-hybridized (part of a double bond) and is only bonded to three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen).\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, it has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) is chiral due to atropisomerism.\n*   Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) is chiral due to a chiral center.\n*   Compound 3 (benzophenone) is achiral.\n*   Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is achiral.\n\nThus, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
