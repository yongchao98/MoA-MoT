    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues and Identify the Compounds**\n\nThe problem provides a series of chemical reactions. The key is to use the properties of the reactants and products to identify them one by one.\n\n*   **Clue 3: C + H₂O → A + F + G**\n    *   This is a hydrolysis reaction where the starting material A is reformed. This suggests a disproportionation reaction.\n    *   F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. A common and fitting pair of acids produced from the hydrolysis of a single compound is a strong hydrohalic acid (like HCl) and a weak oxoacid.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that F is hydrochloric acid (HCl, strong) and G is sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃, weak). H₂SO₃ is formed when SO₂ dissolves in water.\n    *   This hypothesis implies that compound C contains sulfur and chlorine.\n    *   The reaction would be: `[Sulfur Chloride Compound C] + H₂O → S (forms A) + SO₂ (forms G) + HCl (F)`.\n    *   This fits the description: A is regenerated (elemental sulfur), F is a strong acid (HCl), and G is a weak acid (H₂SO₃).\n\n*   **Clue 1: Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → Bright red product C**\n    *   Based on our hypothesis, A is elemental sulfur, which is a solid (typically as S₈). B would be chlorine gas (Cl₂). C is a sulfur chloride.\n    *   Let's check the stoichiometry: A = S₈, B = Cl₂.\n    *   The reaction is: `S₈ (solid) + 8 Cl₂ (gas) → 8 SCl₂`.\n    *   This reaction has a 1:8 molar ratio between A (S₈) and B (Cl₂), which perfectly matches the clue.\n    *   Furthermore, sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red product C\".\n    *   So, we can confidently identify:\n        *   **A = S₈ (Sulfur)**\n        *   **B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)**\n        *   **C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)**\n\n*   **Clue 4: D + B → H (1:1 ratio)**\n    *   We know B is chlorine gas (Cl₂). D is another gas, and H is a solvent.\n    *   `D (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) → H (solvent)`\n    *   A common reaction that fits this description is the addition of chlorine to an alkene. Let's test ethylene (C₂H₄) as gas D.\n    *   `C₂H₄ (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) → C₂H₄Cl₂ (liquid)`\n    *   The product, 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂), is a widely used solvent. This fits all parts of the clue.\n    *   So, we identify:\n        *   **D = C₂H₄ (Ethylene)**\n        *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**\n\n*   **Clue 2: C + 2 equivalents of gas D → Extremely hazardous product E**\n    *   We have identified C = SCl₂ and D = C₂H₄.\n    *   The reaction is: `SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → E`\n    *   This is a known reaction, the Levinstein process, which is used to produce bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2 CH₂=CH₂ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The product, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, is commonly known as **mustard gas**, a potent chemical warfare agent. This certainly fits the description \"extremely hazardous product E\".\n    *   So, we identify:\n        *   **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas)**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\nNow that we have identified E as mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, we need to determine its point group.\n\n1.  **Molecular Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two identical 2-chloroethyl groups (-CH₂CH₂Cl). Due to the two lone pairs on the sulfur atom, the C-S-C bond is bent, similar to the H-O-H bond in water.\n\n2.  **Conformation:** The molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the S-C and C-C single bonds. The overall symmetry depends on the specific, low-energy conformation the molecule adopts. We look for the most symmetric, plausible conformation.\n\n3.  **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   Let's try to find a C₂ axis. An axis passing through the S atom and bisecting the C-S-C angle can be a C₂ axis. If the two -CH₂CH₂Cl chains are arranged as identical \"propellers\" (i.e., they have the same set of dihedral angles), a 180° rotation around this axis will map the molecule onto itself. This is a very plausible conformation, analogous to the most stable conformer of diethyl ether.\n    *   Let's check for mirror planes (σ). A C₂v point group would require two mirror planes. One would have to contain the C-S-C atoms. For this to be a mirror plane, the rest of the chains must also lie in this plane, which would force an unfavorable eclipsed conformation. Therefore, there are no mirror planes.\n    *   Let's check for an inversion center (i). There is no point in the molecule through which inversion of all atoms results in an identical structure.\n    *   Since the molecule possesses a C₂ axis but lacks mirror planes or an inversion center, its point group is C₂.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The point group for the most symmetric stable conformer of mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, is C₂.\n\n**Final Answer Selection**\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) C₂\nB) D₄h\nC) C₂v\nD) D∞h\n\nOur derived point group is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
