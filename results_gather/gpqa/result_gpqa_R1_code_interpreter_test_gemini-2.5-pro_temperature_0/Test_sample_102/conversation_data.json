    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring attached to an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A moderately deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A weakly deactivating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that the synthesis should be planned around the directing effects of the groups, likely by introducing *meta*-directing groups first.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed reaction sequence:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene (Nitration).\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline (Reduction). The -NH2 group is a strong *ortho, para*-director.\n*   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). This reaction **fails**. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a complex (-NH2+AlCl3-). This makes the ring strongly deactivated and prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Therefore, sequence A is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene (Bromination). The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (Nitration). The para product is major.\n*   iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). This reaction **fails**. The ring is strongly deactivated by two deactivating groups (-Br and -NO2), preventing the Friedel-Crafts acylation. Therefore, sequence C is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium salt + H3PO2 → Benzene (Deamination). This sequence of steps (i-iv) starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It is an illogical and inefficient pathway. Therefore, sequence D is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) **Benzene → Acetophenone** (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). This is a standard reaction. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n*   ii) **Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone** (Bromination). The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This is a correct and efficient step.\n*   iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** (Nitration). At this stage, the ring has a -COCH3 group at C1 and a -Br group at C3.\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to the other meta position (C5).\n    *   The -Br group directs to the ortho/para positions (C2, C4, C6).\n    *   Although the directing effects conflict, the ring is deactivated by both groups. The positions ortho and para to the strong deactivator (-COCH3) are the most deactivated. The position meta to both groups (C5) is the least deactivated site and is where the substitution will occur. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence B provide a logical and chemically sound synthesis for the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and would alter the already-formed target molecule, indicating a likely error in the question's formulation. However, since options A, C, and D are fundamentally flawed, sequence B is the only viable choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
