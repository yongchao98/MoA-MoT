    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare two phenomena that cause a dip in a star's observed brightness:\n*   **Rotational Modulation:** A star with a cooler, darker (spotted) hemisphere will appear dimmer when that hemisphere faces us and brighter when the unspotted hemisphere faces us.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** A planet passing in front of its star blocks a small fraction of the starlight, causing a dip in brightness.\n\nWe need to find the size of an exoplanet (relative to its star) that would produce a brightness dip of the same magnitude as the one caused by the starspots.\n\n**2. Model the Flux from the Star**\n\nWe can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the flux (energy per unit area per unit time) emitted by a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (`F ∝ T⁴`). The total brightness (luminosity) is this flux multiplied by the emitting area (`L = A * σ * T⁴`, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant). For our calculations, we only need the relative changes, so we can ignore the constant σ and work with proportionality.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk of the star has an area `A_disk = π * R_star²` and a uniform temperature `T_eff`.\n    `F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff⁴`\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. The visible disk still has the same total area `A_disk`. However, a fraction `f` (the filling factor) of this area is covered by cooler spots, while the remaining fraction `(1 - f)` is at the normal effective temperature.\n    *   Area of spots = `f * A_disk`\n    *   Area of normal photosphere = `(1 - f) * A_disk`\n    *   The total flux is the sum of the flux from the hot and cool parts:\n        `F_min ∝ [(1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴] + [f * A_disk * T_spot⁴]`\n        `F_min ∝ A_disk * [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]`\n\n**3. Calculate the Amplitude of the Starspot Signal**\n\nThe amplitude of the signal is the relative drop in brightness, which is calculated as `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n\n`Amplitude = (A_disk * T_eff⁴ - A_disk * [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / (A_disk * T_eff⁴)`\n\nThe `A_disk` term cancels out:\n\n`Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n`Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n`Amplitude = (f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n`Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n**4. Model the Exoplanet Transit Signal**\n\nThe drop in brightness during an exoplanet transit (the \"transit depth\") is simply the ratio of the planet's cross-sectional area to the star's cross-sectional area.\n\n`Transit Depth = Area_planet / Area_star`\n`Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)`\n`Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n**5. Equate the Signals and Solve**\n\nThe problem asks for the planet size that produces the *same amplitude signal*. Therefore, we set the `Transit Depth` equal to the `Amplitude` from the starspots.\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nNow, we can solve for the relative radius `R_pl / R_star`:\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) )`\n\n**6. Substitute the Given Values**\n\n*   Filling factor, `f = 20% = 0.20`\n*   Effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   Spot temperature, `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n\nLet's perform the calculation using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots on the spotty hemisphere\nT_eff = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# The derived formula for the relative planet radius\n# R_pl/R_star = sqrt( f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4) )\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4))\n\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n>>>\n0.3217901098901099\n<<<\nThe calculation shows that the relative radius `R_pl / R_star` is approximately 0.3218. This value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl`) relative to its host star's radius (`R_star`) that would produce the same brightness dip as the rotational modulation of a star with a spotted hemisphere.\n\n**1. Calculate the Flux Drop due to Starspots**\n\nThe brightness or flux (F) of a star is proportional to its emitting area (A) and the fourth power of its effective temperature (T), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (`F ∝ A * T⁴`).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible disk has a temperature `T_eff`.\n    `F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff⁴` where `A_disk` is the area of the star's visible disk.\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. A fraction `f` (the filling factor) of the disk is covered by cooler spots at temperature `T_spot`, and the remaining fraction `(1 - f)` is at the normal temperature `T_eff`.\n    `F_min ∝ [(1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴] + [f * A_disk * T_spot⁴]`\n\nThe relative amplitude of the brightness variation is `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n\n`Amplitude_spots = (A_disk * T_eff⁴ - {[(1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴] + [f * A_disk * T_spot⁴]}) / (A_disk * T_eff⁴)`\n\nThe `A_disk` term cancels out. Simplifying the numerator:\n`Numerator = T_eff⁴ - (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴`\n`Numerator = T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴`\n`Numerator = f * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴)`\n\nSo, the amplitude becomes:\n`Amplitude_spots = f * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴ = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n**2. Calculate the Flux Drop due to an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nThe drop in brightness during an exoplanet transit is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n`Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n**3. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve**\n\nWe need to find the planet size that produces the same signal, so we set the two amplitudes equal:\n`Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nNow, we can solve for the relative radius `R_pl / R_star`:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) )`\n\n**4. Substitute the Given Values**\n\n*   Filling factor, `f = 20% = 0.20`\n*   Star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   Spot temperature, `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * 0.51775 )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.10355 )`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nThe code output confirms this calculation: `0.32179...`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.32.\n\n<<<B>>>"
