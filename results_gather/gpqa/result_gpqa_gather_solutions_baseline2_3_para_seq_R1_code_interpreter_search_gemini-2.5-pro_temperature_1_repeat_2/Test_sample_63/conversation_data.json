The provided candidate answers largely follow the correct logical path, and we can synthesize them into a definitive solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Products and Their Quantities\n\nThe gas mixture from the decomposition is analyzed by passing it through a series of tubes, which allows us to identify and quantify the components.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is ~18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which turns cloudy in the presence of acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is equal to the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   The atomic mass of an oxygen atom (O) is ~16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that passed through all tubes without reacting has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. Let's find the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the water. From 0.20 mol of H₂O, we have:\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen, which makes up the final inert gas, N₂. Let's verify by mass:\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass for Nitrogen = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   Molar mass of Gas C = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**, which confirms Gas C is **N₂**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe salts contain N, H, and O and the mixture is equimolar. Therefore, one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B must together contain atoms in the ratio we found: N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20: N:H:O = **4:8:5**.\n*   The combined chemical formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nGiven they are salts containing N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by **two ammonium ions** (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n*   Subtracting the atoms from the cations (N₂H₈) from the total formula (N₄H₈O₅) leaves the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The two anions must together have the formula N₂O₅. The most common and logical partition into two stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to sum the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis calculated value of 17 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Experimental Data to Identify Products and Quantities**\n\nThe problem requires a systematic analysis of the decomposition products to determine the identity of the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, it means **no acidic gases** were formed. This suggests the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is entirely from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 liters of a gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture. We can use the product analysis to find the total moles of each element present.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identification of the Third Element:** We can find the mass of the remaining element by subtracting the masses of hydrogen and oxygen from the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g of mass belongs to the 0.10 mol of inert Gas C. Therefore, the molar mass of Gas C is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28 g/mol**. The only common, stable gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is nitrogen (N₂).\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):**\n    *   Total moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial mixture was equimolar and contained 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. The combined atomic ratio for one formula unit of Salt A and one of Salt B must be N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25. To simplify this to whole numbers, we can multiply by 20, yielding an atomic ratio of **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to partition this combined formula into two plausible salt structures. Since the salts contain N, H, and O, they are very likely ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions.\n\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈). This suggests that each salt contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Subtracting the two ammonium cations from the total formula leaves the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The most logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common anions is into the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)** and the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)**, as their sum (NO₃ + NO₂) is N₂O₅.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the provided solutions shows a remarkable consensus on the chemical reasoning and calculation, despite confusion in matching the final numerical answer to the correct letter option. The following is a synthesized, step-by-step solution based on the unanimous reasoning of the agents.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Experimental Data**\n\nThe first step is to correctly interpret the data from the sequential gas analysis to determine the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This tube's weight did not change, indicating that no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out salts containing carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Hot Copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is equal to the mass of the oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture. We can find the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** Found exclusively in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Found in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol (from H₂O) + 0.05 mol (from reaction with Cu) = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The only logical identity for the remaining inert gas is nitrogen (N₂). Let's verify this by mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   The remaining mass must belong to Nitrogen: 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   This is perfectly consistent with the 0.10 mol of remaining gas being N₂ (which contains 2 × 0.10 = 0.20 mol N atoms).\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial equimolar mixture contained a total of 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. Since it is an equimolar mixture, one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B together must contain atoms in the ratio N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n\n*   To find the simplest whole number ratio, multiply by 20: N:H:O = **4:8:5**.\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   The salts are composed of N, H, and O, so the cation is very likely ammonium (NH₄⁺). The 8 H atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈). This means each salt has one ammonium cation.\n*   Subtracting the two ammonium ions from the total formula gives the composition of the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Answering the Final Question**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 13\nD) 15\n\nThe calculated value of 17 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**Analysis of the Provided Solutions and Problem-Solving Steps**\n\n1.  **Deconstruction of the Problem and Identification of Products**\n    The core of the problem is to identify salts A and B by analyzing their gaseous decomposition products. The consensus among all candidate answers is a consistent and correct interpretation of the experimental data.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This tube absorbs water. The mass gain of 3.60 g corresponds to H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂)**: The mass did not change, meaning **no acidic gases** (like CO₂) were produced. This is a critical point that rules out carbon-containing salts.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Hot Copper)**: The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the reaction with an oxidizing gas to form CuO.

This identifies Gas C as **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n*   **Total moles of Nitrogen (N):**\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe equimolar mixture contains 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. This means the combined chemical formula for one unit of Salt A plus one unit of Salt B must have an atomic ratio of N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\nTo get the smallest integer ratio, we multiply by 20, which gives: **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe must now partition this total formula into two plausible salt formulas.\n*   The salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases. This strongly suggests they are ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts.\n*   The 8 H atoms in the combined formula are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n*   Subtracting the two ammonium ions from our total formula leaves the components for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   We must now split N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only logical partition is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis value is calculated consistently across all candidate answers. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 15\nB) 17\nC) 19\nD) 13\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the problem statement and the candidate solutions.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Experimental Data\n\nFirst, we analyze the information from each step of the experiment to identify the products and their quantities.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This tube is a desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, it means **no acidic gases were produced**. This is a key piece of negative evidence, ruling out salts that contain carbon.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: The mass increase of the tube by 0.80 g is due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n*   **Remaining Gas (C)**: After the previous reactions, 2.24 L of a chemically inert gas remains, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can determine the total amount of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture of salts. The elements present are Hydrogen, Oxygen, and the element(s) making up the inert Gas C.\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H)**: All the hydrogen is found in the water produced.\n    *   Moles H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles O = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Moles of the Final Element (Nitrogen)**: We find the remaining mass to identify Gas C.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = 2.80 g.\n    *   This 2.80 g corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   An inert gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is Nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N)** = 2 × (Moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### 3. Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B\n\nThe equimolar mixture of salts A and B contains a total of 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n*   The combined atomic ratio of one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B is the same as the molar ratio: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n*   To get the simplest whole number ratio, we multiply by 20: N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since the substances are salts containing N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be split into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only logical combination is the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂)**: 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃)**: 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total Number of Atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis calculated value of 17 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n**Analysis of the problem-solving process:**\nAll provided answers follow a similar, logical procedure to solve the problem. The core steps are:\n\n1.  **Analysis of Experimental Data:** Correctly interpret the function of each tube to determine the quantities of the products.\n    *   Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂): Absorbs H₂O. Mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂): Absorbs acidic gases. No mass change indicates no acidic gases were produced (ruling out C, S, etc.).\n    *   Tube №3 (Hot Cu): Reacts with an oxidizing gas. Mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Remaining Gas C: 2.24 L at STP corresponds to 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol of an inert gas.\n\n2.  **Determination of Elemental Composition:** Use the law of conservation of mass to find the elemental composition of the original 7.20 g mixture.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** from 0.20 mol H₂O → 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol H.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** from 0.20 mol H₂O and 0.05 mol O in the Cu tube → 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass (7.20g - Mass H - Mass O) is 2.80 g. The inert Gas C has a molar mass of 2.80g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol, identifying it as N₂. Thus, the total moles of N atoms are 2 * 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n\n3.  **Identification of Salts A and B:** Use the elemental ratio and the \"equimolar mixture\" condition to find the salt formulas.\n    *   The overall atomic ratio in the mixture (one unit of A + one unit of B) is N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25, which simplifies to the integer ratio **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   Recognizing the components are salts suggests the cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺). Two ammonium ions (2 x NH₄⁺) perfectly account for the N₂H₈ portion of the formula.\n    *   The remaining portion, N₂O₅, must belong to the anions. This perfectly splits into the nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻) anions.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) ** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Calculate the total number of atoms as requested.\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n**Conclusion on Candidate Answers:**\nAll candidate answers that perform the complete chemical analysis arrive at the correct salts and the correct total atom count of 17. The discrepancies in their final selected letter (A, B, C, or D) are due to clerical errors, where the correctly calculated number (17) is mismatched with the option letters.\n\nThe correct value is 17. According to the provided options:\nA) 19\nB) 17\nC) 15\nD) 13\n\nThe value 17 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a comprehensive review of the problem and the provided solutions.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Identification of Products\n\nThe core of this problem lies in correctly identifying the gaseous products of the thermal decomposition and their respective quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube is designed to absorb water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g directly corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Using the molar mass of H₂O (≈18.0 g/mol), we find the moles of water:\n        Moles H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube is a test for acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its mass did not change is a crucial piece of negative evidence: **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing carbon, such as carbonates or oxalates.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is entirely due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Using the atomic mass of oxygen (O, ≈16.0 g/mol), we find the moles of oxygen atoms that reacted:\n        Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all the reactions, 2.24 L of an inert gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Using the molar volume of a gas at STP (22.4 L/mol), we find the moles of Gas C:\n        Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Salt Mixture\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all the atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (moles from H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The salts are composed of N, H, and O. The final unreacted gas (Gas C) must be nitrogen (N₂). We can verify this by a mass balance check.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass for Nitrogen = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C is its mass divided by its moles: 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This confirms that Gas C is indeed nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture contained 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nWe are told the mixture is equimolar. Therefore, the combined formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an atomic ratio corresponding to the moles we found: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To get the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n    *   N: 0.20 × 20 = 4\n    *   H: 0.40 × 20 = 8\n    *   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n*   The combined formula is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts made of N, H, and O, the most common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula gives us the composition of the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The two most common nitrogen-oxygen anions that sum to N₂O₅ are **nitrate (NO₃⁻)** and **nitrite (NO₂⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Identification of Products\n\nThe first step is to correctly interpret the data from the sequential gas analysis. All the provided solutions follow this initial process correctly.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. Since the mass did not change, **no acidic gases** (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of a gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original 7.20 g salt mixture. We can determine the total moles of each element in the original mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** Found exclusively in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Identification of Gas C and Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** We can identify the final gas and its element by mass balance.\n    *   Mass of H in mixture = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O in mixture = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass for Gas C's element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. The most common and inert gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**. This is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nWe need to find two salts, A and B, that in an equimolar mixture provide these elemental totals. The combined atomic formula for one unit of (A + B) must have an atomic ratio of N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To get the smallest integer ratio, we multiply by 20, yielding N:H:O = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O, strongly suggesting they are ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts.\n*   The 8 H atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), meaning each salt contains one NH₄⁺ cation.\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula leaves the atoms for the anions: N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be partitioned into two anions. The only logical partition into common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to answer the question: what is the total number of all atoms in salts A and B?\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis value is found consistently across all correct logical derivations presented in the candidate answers. The final choice should correspond to this value.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer, based on a synthesis of the provided reasoning.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Product Identification**\nThe first step is to accurately identify the products of the thermal decomposition and their quantities. The logical flow for this is consistent across all successful analyses.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This tube absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This tube absorbs acidic gases. The fact that its weight did not change indicates that **no acidic gases** (like CO₂) were produced. This strongly suggests the initial salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: The mass of the solid in the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of an Oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) reacted = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas)**: The gas that passed through all tubes without reacting. Its volume at standard temperature and pressure (STP) is 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture. We can determine the total moles of each element in the original salts.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen is found in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol (from H₂O) + 0.05 mol (from reaction with Cu) = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identification of the Third Element**: We can find the mass of the remaining element by subtracting the mass of H and O from the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H and O = (0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol) = 0.40 g + 4.00 g = 4.40 g.\n    *   Mass of remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   This mass belongs to the 0.10 mol of inert Gas C. Therefore, the molar mass of Gas C is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. The inert gas with this molar mass is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N)**: From the 2.80 g of nitrogen.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n### **3. Identification of Salts A and B**\nThe initial mixture was equimolar and composed of N, H, and O. The combined chemical formula for one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B must have atoms in the same ratio as the moles we found:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo obtain the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n**N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since A and B are salts, they consist of a cation and an anion. The elements present strongly suggest the cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), implying each salt has one NH₄⁺ cation.\n\nSubtracting the two cations from the total formula leaves the composition for the two anions:\nN₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n\nWe must partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only logical combination is the **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)** ions.\n(NO₂⁻) + (NO₃⁻) = N₂O₅.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**\n\n### **4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\nThe final step is to answer the question, which asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis result is consistently derived by every provided analysis. Matching this value to the options:\nA) 13\nB) 15\nC) 19\nD) 17\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Experimental Data and Identify Products\nThe problem involves a thermal decomposition, and the products are analyzed sequentially. This requires careful tracking of what happens in each stage.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This tube is for absorbing water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This tube is for absorbing acidic gases (like CO₂). Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts containing carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase corresponds purely to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n4.  **Gas C (Remaining gas)**: After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of an inert gas remained, measured at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 2.24 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture. We can determine the total moles of each element in the original sample.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen from the salts ended up in the water.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen ended up in both the water and the copper oxide.\n    *   Total moles of O = Moles of O in H₂O + Moles of O reacted with Cu = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N)**: The only common element that forms salts and an inert gas (Gas C) is nitrogen. We can verify this by checking the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining Mass = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   The remaining gas C (0.10 mol) is made of this element. Its molar mass is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. This confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B\nThe original sample was an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Therefore, the molar ratio of the elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the ratio in one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B.\n\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n    *   N:H:O = 4 : 8 : 5\n*   The combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts composed of N, H, and O, the most common cation is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈). This means each salt, A and B, contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The two most common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Their sum is NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ = N₂O₅, which is a perfect match.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. We need to sum the atoms in one formula unit of each.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** The formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** The formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n### Final Answer Selection\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17. Matching this value with the provided options:\nA) 15\nB) 17\nC) 19\nD) 13\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers, all of them follow a sound and consistent logical path to solve the problem. The core of the solution lies in accurately identifying the products of the decomposition and then working backward to find the composition and identity of the original salts. Here is a step-by-step synthesis of the correct reasoning.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Experimental Data and Identification of Products**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced. Using the molar mass of H₂O (≈18.0 g/mol), we find the amount of water produced:\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. The mass did not change, indicating no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Hot Copper):** The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase corresponds directly to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas volume is 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture. We can calculate the total moles of each element in the original sample.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen ends up in the H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × Moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = Moles(O in H₂O) + Moles(O from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The salts must be composed of H, N, and O. We can find the mass of Nitrogen by subtracting the mass of H and O from the total.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   This is consistent with the remaining inert gas C (0.10 mol) being N₂, which contains 0.20 mol of nitrogen atoms.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe mixture is equimolar and contains 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. The atomic ratio in one combined unit of (Salt A + Salt B) is therefore N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we multiply by 20, yielding N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   We must partition the formula N₄H₈O₅ into two chemically plausible salts.\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms strongly suggest the presence of two ammonium cations (2 × NH₄⁺), which perfectly accounts for N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the cations leaves N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅ for the two anions.\n*   The most logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common anions is into the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻) and the nitrite ion (NO₂⁻).\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., the sum of atoms in their individual chemical formulas).\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 17\nB) 15\nC) 19\nD) 13\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers to arrive at the final, correct conclusion.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of two salts, A and B, followed by a sequential analysis of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial piece of negative evidence: **no acidic gases were formed**. This effectively rules out salts containing carbon, such as carbonates or oxalates.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This means the tube's contents reacted with an oxidizing gas, and the mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of an Oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) reacted = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now determine the total amount of each element in the original sample.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms are found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining common element that forms salts and an inert gas (N₂) is nitrogen. We can verify this by checking the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   The remaining mass in the original sample must be nitrogen: Mass(N) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   Molar mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. This confirms that Gas C is indeed **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**, which is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The combined chemical formula for one formula unit of A plus one formula unit of B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n*   N:H:O = (0.20 × 20) : (0.40 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n\nThe combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since A and B are salts composed of N, H, and O, they are very likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n*   The 8 Hydrogen atoms in the combined formula are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), suggesting each salt contains one ammonium ion. Two NH₄⁺ ions account for **N₂H₈**.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives us the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The two anions must together have the formula N₂O₅. The most common and chemically logical partition of N₂O₅ into two stable anions is the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)** and the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)**.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite (**NH₄NO₂**)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate (**NH₄NO₃**)\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂, or N₂H₄O₂):** 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃, or N₂H₄O₃):** 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical answer is consistently derived by all correct methods. Matching this result with the provided options:\nA) 15\nB) 17\nC) 13\nD) 19\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Experimental Data to Identify Products**\n\nThe first step is to analyze the data from the sequence of tubes to determine the identity and quantity of the gaseous decomposition products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases (e.g., CO₂, SO₂). The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial piece of negative evidence: **no acidic gases were formed**. This effectively rules out salts containing carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. The formation of copper oxide (CuO) indicates a reaction with an oxygen-containing gas. The mass increase of the tube's contents, 0.80 g, is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L of a gas remained after passing through all tubes. This measurement is at standard temperature and pressure (STP). The gas must be inert to the previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. The elements present are Hydrogen, Oxygen, and the unknown element(s) in Gas C.\n\n*   Let's find the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O. Moles H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper. Moles O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Mass and Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be the element that forms the inert Gas C. The most logical candidate is Nitrogen.\n        *   Mass H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Mass of remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n        *   Since Gas C (0.10 mol) is made of this element, its molar mass is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol. This confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of two salts (A and B) that, together, contain 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. The atomic ratio in a combined unit of (Salt A + Salt B) is therefore N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo find the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20, which gives:\n**N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis is the combined chemical formula for one formula unit of Salt A and one of Salt B. We need to partition this into two plausible salt structures.\n*   Given that the salts are composed of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺).\n*   The 8 H atoms in the combined formula are a perfect match for two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈). This suggests that each salt contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Subtracting the two ammonium cations from the total formula leaves the atoms that must make up the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   We need to partition N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only chemically sensible choice is the **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** ion and the **nitrate (NO₃⁻)** ion. Their sum is (NO₂⁻) + (NO₃⁻) = N₂O₅, which is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This requires summing the atoms in one formula unit of each.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂. Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃. Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17.

    "The task is to solve a chemical analysis problem by determining the composition of two unknown salts (A and B) and then calculating the total number of atoms in their respective formula units. The analysis will proceed in a step-by-step manner.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Experimental Data and Identify Products**\n\nThe gaseous mixture produced by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes, each designed to remove a specific component. Analyzing the mass changes allows us to quantify the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This limewater solution tests for acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, it confirms that **no acidic gases were produced**. This is a critical piece of information, ruling out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper acts as a reducing agent, and its mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This means an oxidizing gas in the mixture supplied oxygen to the copper. The mass increase is the mass of the oxygen atoms.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of an inert gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The only common element that forms salts and an inert diatomic gas is nitrogen. We can verify this by a mass balance calculation.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass for Gas C's element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Its molar mass is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This confirms that Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (Moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we started with an equimolar mixture. This means that for some number of moles `x`, we have `x` moles of Salt A and `x` moles of Salt B. The total elemental composition (0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, 0.25 mol O) corresponds to `x` moles of the combined entity (A + B). Therefore, the atomic ratio in one unit of A combined with one unit of B is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo convert this to the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\nN : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. Now we must partition this into two chemically plausible salt formulas.\n\n*   The presence of N, H, and O strongly suggests they are ammonium salts.

The provided candidate answers largely follow the correct logical path, and we can synthesize them into a definitive solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Products and Their Quantities\n\nThe gas mixture from the decomposition is analyzed by passing it through a series of tubes, which allows us to identify and quantify the components.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is ~18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which turns cloudy in the presence of acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is equal to the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   The atomic mass of an oxygen atom (O) is ~16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that passed through all tubes without reacting has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. Let's find the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the water. From 0.20 mol of H₂O, we have:\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen, which makes up the final inert gas, N₂. Let's verify by mass:\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass for Nitrogen = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   Molar mass of Gas C = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**, which confirms Gas C is **N₂**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe salts contain N, H, and O and the mixture is equimolar. Therefore, one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B must together contain atoms in the ratio we found: N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20: N:H:O = **4:8:5**.\n*   The combined chemical formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nGiven they are salts containing N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by **two ammonium ions** (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n*   Subtracting the atoms from the cations (N₂H₈) from the total formula (N₄H₈O₅) leaves the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The two anions must together have the formula N₂O₅. The most common and logical partition into two stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to sum the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis calculated value of 17 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Experimental Data to Identify Products and Quantities**\n\nThe problem requires a systematic analysis of the decomposition products to determine the identity of the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, it means **no acidic gases** were formed. This suggests the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is entirely from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 liters of a gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture. We can use the product analysis to find the total moles of each element present.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identification of the Third Element:** We can find the mass of the remaining element by subtracting the masses of hydrogen and oxygen from the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g of mass belongs to the 0.10 mol of inert Gas C. Therefore, the molar mass of Gas C is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28 g/mol**. The only common, stable gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is nitrogen (N₂).\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):**\n    *   Total moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial mixture was equimolar and contained 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. The combined atomic ratio for one formula unit of Salt A and one of Salt B must be N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25. To simplify this to whole numbers, we can multiply by 20, yielding an atomic ratio of **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to partition this combined formula into two plausible salt structures. Since the salts contain N, H, and O, they are very likely ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions.\n\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈). This suggests that each salt contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Subtracting the two ammonium cations from the total formula leaves the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The most logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common anions is into the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)** and the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)**, as their sum (NO₃ + NO₂) is N₂O₅.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the provided solutions shows a remarkable consensus on the chemical reasoning and calculation, despite confusion in matching the final numerical answer to the correct letter option. The following is a synthesized, step-by-step solution based on the unanimous reasoning of the agents.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Experimental Data**\n\nThe first step is to correctly interpret the data from the sequential gas analysis to determine the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This tube's weight did not change, indicating that no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out salts containing carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Hot Copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is equal to the mass of the oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture. We can find the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** Found exclusively in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Found in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol (from H₂O) + 0.05 mol (from reaction with Cu) = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The only logical identity for the remaining inert gas is nitrogen (N₂). Let's verify this by mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   The remaining mass must belong to Nitrogen: 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   This is perfectly consistent with the 0.10 mol of remaining gas being N₂ (which contains 2 × 0.10 = 0.20 mol N atoms).\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial equimolar mixture contained a total of 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. Since it is an equimolar mixture, one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B together must contain atoms in the ratio N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n\n*   To find the simplest whole number ratio, multiply by 20: N:H:O = **4:8:5**.\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   The salts are composed of N, H, and O, so the cation is very likely ammonium (NH₄⁺). The 8 H atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈). This means each salt has one ammonium cation.\n*   Subtracting the two ammonium ions from the total formula gives the composition of the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Answering the Final Question**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 13\nD) 15\n\nThe calculated value of 17 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**Analysis of the Provided Solutions and Problem-Solving Steps**\n\n1.  **Deconstruction of the Problem and Identification of Products**\n    The core of the problem is to identify salts A and B by analyzing their gaseous decomposition products. The consensus among all candidate answers is a consistent and correct interpretation of the experimental data.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This tube absorbs water. The mass gain of 3.60 g corresponds to H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂)**: The mass did not change, meaning **no acidic gases** (like CO₂) were produced. This is a critical point that rules out carbon-containing salts.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Hot Copper)**: The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the reaction with an oxidizing gas to form CuO.

This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of an unreacted gas (C) remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture. We can now calculate the total moles of each element in that mixture.\n\n*   **Total moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Total moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Identification of the third element:** We find the mass of the remaining element by subtracting the mass of H and O from the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of remaining element = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   This 2.80 g mass corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Therefore, the molar mass of Gas C is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. This identifies Gas C as **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n*   **Total moles of Nitrogen (N):**\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe equimolar mixture contains 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. This means the combined chemical formula for one unit of Salt A plus one unit of Salt B must have an atomic ratio of N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\nTo get the smallest integer ratio, we multiply by 20, which gives: **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe must now partition this total formula into two plausible salt formulas.\n*   The salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases. This strongly suggests they are ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts.\n*   The 8 H atoms in the combined formula are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n*   Subtracting the two ammonium ions from our total formula leaves the components for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   We must now split N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only logical partition is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis value is calculated consistently across all candidate answers. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 15\nB) 17\nC) 19\nD) 13\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the problem statement and the candidate solutions.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Experimental Data\n\nFirst, we analyze the information from each step of the experiment to identify the products and their quantities.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This tube is a desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, it means **no acidic gases were produced**. This is a key piece of negative evidence, ruling out salts that contain carbon.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: The mass increase of the tube by 0.80 g is due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n*   **Remaining Gas (C)**: After the previous reactions, 2.24 L of a chemically inert gas remains, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can determine the total amount of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture of salts. The elements present are Hydrogen, Oxygen, and the element(s) making up the inert Gas C.\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H)**: All the hydrogen is found in the water produced.\n    *   Moles H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles O = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Moles of the Final Element (Nitrogen)**: We find the remaining mass to identify Gas C.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = 2.80 g.\n    *   This 2.80 g corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   An inert gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is Nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N)** = 2 × (Moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### 3. Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B\n\nThe equimolar mixture of salts A and B contains a total of 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n*   The combined atomic ratio of one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B is the same as the molar ratio: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n*   To get the simplest whole number ratio, we multiply by 20: N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since the substances are salts containing N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be split into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only logical combination is the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂)**: 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃)**: 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total Number of Atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis calculated value of 17 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n**Analysis of the problem-solving process:**\nAll provided answers follow a similar, logical procedure to solve the problem. The core steps are:\n\n1.  **Analysis of Experimental Data:** Correctly interpret the function of each tube to determine the quantities of the products.\n    *   Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂): Absorbs H₂O. Mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂): Absorbs acidic gases. No mass change indicates no acidic gases were produced (ruling out C, S, etc.).\n    *   Tube №3 (Hot Cu): Reacts with an oxidizing gas. Mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Remaining Gas C: 2.24 L at STP corresponds to 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol of an inert gas.\n\n2.  **Determination of Elemental Composition:** Use the law of conservation of mass to find the elemental composition of the original 7.20 g mixture.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** from 0.20 mol H₂O → 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol H.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** from 0.20 mol H₂O and 0.05 mol O in the Cu tube → 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass (7.20g - Mass H - Mass O) is 2.80 g. The inert Gas C has a molar mass of 2.80g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol, identifying it as N₂. Thus, the total moles of N atoms are 2 * 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n\n3.  **Identification of Salts A and B:** Use the elemental ratio and the \"equimolar mixture\" condition to find the salt formulas.\n    *   The overall atomic ratio in the mixture (one unit of A + one unit of B) is N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25, which simplifies to the integer ratio **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   Recognizing the components are salts suggests the cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺). Two ammonium ions (2 x NH₄⁺) perfectly account for the N₂H₈ portion of the formula.\n    *   The remaining portion, N₂O₅, must belong to the anions. This perfectly splits into the nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻) anions.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) ** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Calculate the total number of atoms as requested.\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n**Conclusion on Candidate Answers:**\nAll candidate answers that perform the complete chemical analysis arrive at the correct salts and the correct total atom count of 17. The discrepancies in their final selected letter (A, B, C, or D) are due to clerical errors, where the correctly calculated number (17) is mismatched with the option letters.\n\nThe correct value is 17. According to the provided options:\nA) 19\nB) 17\nC) 15\nD) 13\n\nThe value 17 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a comprehensive review of the problem and the provided solutions.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Identification of Products\n\nThe core of this problem lies in correctly identifying the gaseous products of the thermal decomposition and their respective quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube is designed to absorb water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g directly corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Using the molar mass of H₂O (≈18.0 g/mol), we find the moles of water:\n        Moles H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube is a test for acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its mass did not change is a crucial piece of negative evidence: **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing carbon, such as carbonates or oxalates.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is entirely due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Using the atomic mass of oxygen (O, ≈16.0 g/mol), we find the moles of oxygen atoms that reacted:\n        Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all the reactions, 2.24 L of an inert gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Using the molar volume of a gas at STP (22.4 L/mol), we find the moles of Gas C:\n        Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Salt Mixture\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all the atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (moles from H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The salts are composed of N, H, and O. The final unreacted gas (Gas C) must be nitrogen (N₂). We can verify this by a mass balance check.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass for Nitrogen = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C is its mass divided by its moles: 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This confirms that Gas C is indeed nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture contained 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nWe are told the mixture is equimolar. Therefore, the combined formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an atomic ratio corresponding to the moles we found: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To get the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n    *   N: 0.20 × 20 = 4\n    *   H: 0.40 × 20 = 8\n    *   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n*   The combined formula is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts made of N, H, and O, the most common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula gives us the composition of the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The two most common nitrogen-oxygen anions that sum to N₂O₅ are **nitrate (NO₃⁻)** and **nitrite (NO₂⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Identification of Products\n\nThe first step is to correctly interpret the data from the sequential gas analysis. All the provided solutions follow this initial process correctly.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. Since the mass did not change, **no acidic gases** (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of a gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original 7.20 g salt mixture. We can determine the total moles of each element in the original mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** Found exclusively in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Identification of Gas C and Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** We can identify the final gas and its element by mass balance.\n    *   Mass of H in mixture = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O in mixture = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass for Gas C's element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. The most common and inert gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**. This is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nWe need to find two salts, A and B, that in an equimolar mixture provide these elemental totals. The combined atomic formula for one unit of (A + B) must have an atomic ratio of N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To get the smallest integer ratio, we multiply by 20, yielding N:H:O = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O, strongly suggesting they are ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts.\n*   The 8 H atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), meaning each salt contains one NH₄⁺ cation.\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula leaves the atoms for the anions: N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be partitioned into two anions. The only logical partition into common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to answer the question: what is the total number of all atoms in salts A and B?\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis value is found consistently across all correct logical derivations presented in the candidate answers. The final choice should correspond to this value.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer, based on a synthesis of the provided reasoning.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Product Identification**\nThe first step is to accurately identify the products of the thermal decomposition and their quantities. The logical flow for this is consistent across all successful analyses.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This tube absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This tube absorbs acidic gases. The fact that its weight did not change indicates that **no acidic gases** (like CO₂) were produced. This strongly suggests the initial salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: The mass of the solid in the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of an Oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) reacted = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas)**: The gas that passed through all tubes without reacting. Its volume at standard temperature and pressure (STP) is 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture. We can determine the total moles of each element in the original salts.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen is found in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol (from H₂O) + 0.05 mol (from reaction with Cu) = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identification of the Third Element**: We can find the mass of the remaining element by subtracting the mass of H and O from the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H and O = (0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol) = 0.40 g + 4.00 g = 4.40 g.\n    *   Mass of remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   This mass belongs to the 0.10 mol of inert Gas C. Therefore, the molar mass of Gas C is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. The inert gas with this molar mass is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N)**: From the 2.80 g of nitrogen.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n### **3. Identification of Salts A and B**\nThe initial mixture was equimolar and composed of N, H, and O. The combined chemical formula for one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B must have atoms in the same ratio as the moles we found:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo obtain the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n**N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since A and B are salts, they consist of a cation and an anion. The elements present strongly suggest the cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), implying each salt has one NH₄⁺ cation.\n\nSubtracting the two cations from the total formula leaves the composition for the two anions:\nN₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n\nWe must partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only logical combination is the **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)** ions.\n(NO₂⁻) + (NO₃⁻) = N₂O₅.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**\n\n### **4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\nThe final step is to answer the question, which asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis result is consistently derived by every provided analysis. Matching this value to the options:\nA) 13\nB) 15\nC) 19\nD) 17\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Experimental Data and Identify Products\nThe problem involves a thermal decomposition, and the products are analyzed sequentially. This requires careful tracking of what happens in each stage.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This tube is for absorbing water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This tube is for absorbing acidic gases (like CO₂). Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts containing carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase corresponds purely to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n4.  **Gas C (Remaining gas)**: After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of an inert gas remained, measured at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 2.24 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture. We can determine the total moles of each element in the original sample.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen from the salts ended up in the water.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen ended up in both the water and the copper oxide.\n    *   Total moles of O = Moles of O in H₂O + Moles of O reacted with Cu = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N)**: The only common element that forms salts and an inert gas (Gas C) is nitrogen. We can verify this by checking the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining Mass = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   The remaining gas C (0.10 mol) is made of this element. Its molar mass is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. This confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B\nThe original sample was an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Therefore, the molar ratio of the elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the ratio in one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B.\n\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n    *   N:H:O = 4 : 8 : 5\n*   The combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts composed of N, H, and O, the most common cation is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈). This means each salt, A and B, contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The two most common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Their sum is NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ = N₂O₅, which is a perfect match.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. We need to sum the atoms in one formula unit of each.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** The formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** The formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n### Final Answer Selection\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17. Matching this value with the provided options:\nA) 15\nB) 17\nC) 19\nD) 13\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers, all of them follow a sound and consistent logical path to solve the problem. The core of the solution lies in accurately identifying the products of the decomposition and then working backward to find the composition and identity of the original salts. Here is a step-by-step synthesis of the correct reasoning.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Experimental Data and Identification of Products**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced. Using the molar mass of H₂O (≈18.0 g/mol), we find the amount of water produced:\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. The mass did not change, indicating no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Hot Copper):** The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase corresponds directly to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas volume is 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture. We can calculate the total moles of each element in the original sample.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen ends up in the H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × Moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = Moles(O in H₂O) + Moles(O from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The salts must be composed of H, N, and O. We can find the mass of Nitrogen by subtracting the mass of H and O from the total.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   This is consistent with the remaining inert gas C (0.10 mol) being N₂, which contains 0.20 mol of nitrogen atoms.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe mixture is equimolar and contains 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. The atomic ratio in one combined unit of (Salt A + Salt B) is therefore N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we multiply by 20, yielding N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   We must partition the formula N₄H₈O₅ into two chemically plausible salts.\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms strongly suggest the presence of two ammonium cations (2 × NH₄⁺), which perfectly accounts for N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the cations leaves N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅ for the two anions.\n*   The most logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common anions is into the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻) and the nitrite ion (NO₂⁻).\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., the sum of atoms in their individual chemical formulas).\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 17\nB) 15\nC) 19\nD) 13\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers to arrive at the final, correct conclusion.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of two salts, A and B, followed by a sequential analysis of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial piece of negative evidence: **no acidic gases were formed**. This effectively rules out salts containing carbon, such as carbonates or oxalates.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This means the tube's contents reacted with an oxidizing gas, and the mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of an Oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) reacted = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now determine the total amount of each element in the original sample.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms are found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining common element that forms salts and an inert gas (N₂) is nitrogen. We can verify this by checking the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   The remaining mass in the original sample must be nitrogen: Mass(N) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   Molar mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. This confirms that Gas C is indeed **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**, which is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The combined chemical formula for one formula unit of A plus one formula unit of B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n*   N:H:O = (0.20 × 20) : (0.40 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n\nThe combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since A and B are salts composed of N, H, and O, they are very likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n*   The 8 Hydrogen atoms in the combined formula are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), suggesting each salt contains one ammonium ion. Two NH₄⁺ ions account for **N₂H₈**.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives us the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The two anions must together have the formula N₂O₅. The most common and chemically logical partition of N₂O₅ into two stable anions is the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)** and the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)**.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite (**NH₄NO₂**)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate (**NH₄NO₃**)\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂, or N₂H₄O₂):** 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃, or N₂H₄O₃):** 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical answer is consistently derived by all correct methods. Matching this result with the provided options:\nA) 15\nB) 17\nC) 13\nD) 19\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Experimental Data to Identify Products**\n\nThe first step is to analyze the data from the sequence of tubes to determine the identity and quantity of the gaseous decomposition products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases (e.g., CO₂, SO₂). The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial piece of negative evidence: **no acidic gases were formed**. This effectively rules out salts containing carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. The formation of copper oxide (CuO) indicates a reaction with an oxygen-containing gas. The mass increase of the tube's contents, 0.80 g, is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L of a gas remained after passing through all tubes. This measurement is at standard temperature and pressure (STP). The gas must be inert to the previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. The elements present are Hydrogen, Oxygen, and the unknown element(s) in Gas C.\n\n*   Let's find the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O. Moles H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper. Moles O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Mass and Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be the element that forms the inert Gas C. The most logical candidate is Nitrogen.\n        *   Mass H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Mass of remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n        *   Since Gas C (0.10 mol) is made of this element, its molar mass is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol. This confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of two salts (A and B) that, together, contain 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. The atomic ratio in a combined unit of (Salt A + Salt B) is therefore N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo find the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20, which gives:\n**N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis is the combined chemical formula for one formula unit of Salt A and one of Salt B. We need to partition this into two plausible salt structures.\n*   Given that the salts are composed of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺).\n*   The 8 H atoms in the combined formula are a perfect match for two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈). This suggests that each salt contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Subtracting the two ammonium cations from the total formula leaves the atoms that must make up the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   We need to partition N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only chemically sensible choice is the **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** ion and the **nitrate (NO₃⁻)** ion. Their sum is (NO₂⁻) + (NO₃⁻) = N₂O₅, which is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This requires summing the atoms in one formula unit of each.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂. Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃. Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 17\nB) 15\nC) 19\nD) 13\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
