Conservation of Relativistic Energy**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total energy of the electron-positron system *before* the collision. The energy of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the particle's rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Electron's Energy:** Given its Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`, its energy is `E_e = 4mc²`.\n*   **Positron's Energy:** The positron is the electron's antiparticle, so it has the same rest mass `m`. Given its Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`, its energy is `E_p = 2mc²`.\n*   **Total Initial Energy:** The total energy of the system is the sum of their individual energies:\n    `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\nAfter annihilation, this energy is converted into two photons of equal energy, `E_γ`.\n*   **Total Final Energy:** `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n*   According to the conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`.\n    `6mc² = 2E_γ`, which means the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n**2. Conservation of Relativistic Momentum**\n\nNext, we calculate the total momentum of the system before the collision. Momentum is a vector. Let's define the direction of the incoming electron (from the left) as the positive x-axis. The formula for the magnitude of a particle's relativistic momentum is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n\n*   **Electron's Momentum:** Moving in the +x direction.\n    `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`.\n*   **Positron's Momentum:** Moving in the -x direction.\n    `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum:** The net momentum is the vector sum, which lies entirely along the x-axis:\n    `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (mc√15) - (mc√3) = mc(√15 - √3)`.\n\nThis initial momentum must be equal to the total momentum of the two photons after the annihilation.\n*   **Photon Momentum:** The magnitude of a photon's momentum is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. From our energy calculation, this is `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n*   To conserve momentum in the direction perpendicular to the initial motion (the y-direction), the photons must be emitted at symmetric angles relative to the x-axis. Let this angle be `θ` for the upper photon and `-θ` for the lower one.\n*   **Total Final Momentum (x-component):** `P_final_x = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n*   Equating initial and final momentum along the x-axis:\n    `mc(√15 - √3) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n\n**3. Solving for the Angle**\n\nNow we can substitute `p_γ = 3mc` into our momentum equation:\n*   `mc(√15 - √3) = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`.\n*   We can cancel `mc` from both sides: `(√15 - √3) = 6cos(θ)`.\n*   This gives us `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`. Therefore, we need to calculate `Angle = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`.\n\nThe code execution performed this calculation:\n*   `Angle ≈ 138.19°`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 96\nB) 138\nC) 172\nD) 74\n\nThe calculated value of `138.19°` is closest to **138**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step application of the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity. An analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the correct method and final numerical value.\n\n**1. Summary of Physical Principles**\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of the electron and positron before the collision must equal the total energy of the two photons created after the annihilation. The energy of a massive particle is `E = γmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Momentum:** The total momentum of the electron and positron before the collision must equal the total momentum of the two photons. The momentum of a massive particle is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector quantity.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`)**\n    Let `m` be the rest mass of the electron (and positron) and `c` be the speed of light.\n    *   Energy of the electron (`γ_e = 4`): `E_e = 4mc²`\n    *   Energy of the positron (`γ_p = 2`): `E_p = 2mc²`\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum: `E_initial = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate Energy of Each Photon (`E_γ`)**\n    The total initial energy is converted into two photons of equal energy.\n    *   `E_initial = E_final = 2E_γ`\n    *   `6mc² = 2E_γ`\n    *   Therefore, the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`)**\n    Momentum is a vector. We'll define the direction of the electron as positive (+x). The positron moves in the negative direction (-x).\n    *   Momentum of the electron: `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`\n    *   Momentum of the positron: `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`\n    *   The total initial momentum is the vector sum, which lies entirely on the x-axis: `P_initial = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Apply Momentum Conservation to find the angle**\n    The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Using the result from Step 2, `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n    *   Since the initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction is zero, the two photons must fly off at symmetric angles (`+θ` and `-θ`) to the horizontal axis to conserve y-momentum. The angle *between* them is `2θ`.\n    *   The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the photons' momenta: `P_final = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n    *   Equating initial and final momentum: `P_initial = P_final`\n        `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`\n\n*   **Step 5: Solve for the Angle `2θ`**\n    1.  Cancel `mc` from both sides: `√15 - √3 = 6 cos(θ)`\n    2.  Solve for `cos(θ)`: `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n    3.  Calculate the angle between the photons, `2θ`:\n        Angle = `2θ = 2 * arccos( (√15 - √3) / 6 )`\n    4.  Numerically, this value is: `Angle ≈ 138.19°`\n\n**3.

Apply Energy Conservation to Final State**\nThe annihilation produces two photons of equal energy (`E_γ`).\n*   **Total Final Energy (`E_final`):** `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n*   By conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`:\n    `6mc² = 2E_γ`\n    This gives the energy of each photon as `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n**4. Calculate Initial Momentum**\nThe magnitude of a relativistic particle's momentum is given by `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector quantity. Let's define the electron's direction (from left to right) as the positive x-axis.\n*   **Electron's Momentum (`p_e`):** `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`.\n*   **Positron's Momentum (`p_p`):** It moves in the opposite direction, so its momentum is negative. `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`):** The net momentum is the vector sum, which is entirely along the x-axis.\n    `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\n**5.

Using the energy found in step 3, the momentum of each photon is `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n*   The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction was zero. To conserve y-momentum, the two photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal (x) axis. Let this angle be `θ`.\n*   The total final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of each photon's momentum: `P_final_x = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n*   Equating the initial and final momentum in the x-direction:\n    `P_initial = P_final_x`\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γcos(θ)`\n*   Substitute the value of `p_γ = 3mc`:\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`\n\n**6.

Apply Conservation of Momentum to Find the Angle**\n\n*   The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction was zero.

The correct approach, as identified by a strong consensus among the candidate answers, is to apply the laws of conservation of relativistic energy and conservation of relativistic momentum.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Initial State of the System\nWe must first determine the total energy and total momentum of the electron and positron before they collide. Let `m` be the rest mass of an electron (which is the same as for a positron) and `c` be the speed of light.\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (`E_i`):**\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc²`.\n    *   Energy of the electron (`γ_e = 4`): `E_e = 4mc²`\n    *   Energy of the positron (`γ_p = 2`): `E_p = 2mc²`\n    *   Total initial energy is the sum: `E_i = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_i`):**\n    *   The relativistic momentum of a particle is given by `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector.\n    *   Let the electron's direction be the positive (+) x-axis. Its momentum is: `p_e = mc√(4² - 1) = mc√15`.\n    *   The positron moves in the opposite, negative (-) x-axis direction. Its momentum is: `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`.\n    *   The total initial momentum is the vector sum, which lies entirely along the x-axis: `P_i = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Final State and Apply Conservation Laws\nThe system annihilates into two photons of equal energy, `E_γ`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total final energy is `E_f = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n    *   Setting initial energy equal to final energy: `6mc² = 2E_γ`, which means the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Substituting the photon energy, we get `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n    *   The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction was zero. To conserve momentum, the photons must be emitted at symmetric angles `+θ` and `-θ` relative to the horizontal axis.\n    *   The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the photon momenta: `P_f = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n    *   Setting initial momentum equal to final momentum: `(√15 - √3)mc = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n\n### 4. Solve for the Angle\nNow we substitute the photon momentum `p_γ = 3mc` into the equation and solve for the angle.\n\n1.  `(√15 - √3)mc = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ)`\n2.  The `mc` terms cancel out: `√15 - √3 = 6 * cos(θ)`\n3.  Solve for `cos(θ)`: `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n4.  The angle asked for is the total angle *between* the photons, which is `2θ`.\n5.  `Total Angle = 2θ = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`\n\n### 5. Numerical Calculation and Conclusion\nA calculation of the expression `2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)` gives an angle of approximately **138.19°**.\n\nThis result is supported by the overwhelming consensus of calculations from the candidate answers.

Both photons have this momentum magnitude.\n    *   The initial momentum in the y-direction (perpendicular to the collision axis) was zero.

    "This problem requires a step-by-step application of the principles of conservation of relativistic energy and momentum. Here is a consolidated analysis based on the reasoning presented by the agents.\n\n**1. Calculate Initial Relativistic Energy**\n\nThe energy of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n*   **Electron's Energy:** The electron has a Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`. Its energy is `E_e = 4mc²`.\n*   **Positron's Energy:** The positron has a Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`. Its energy is `E_p = 2mc²`.\n*   **Total Initial Energy:** The total energy of the system before the collision is the sum of their individual energies:\n    `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\n**2. Apply Energy Conservation to Find Photon Energy**\n\nAfter the annihilation, the total initial energy is converted into two photons of equal energy, `E_γ`.\n*   **Total Final Energy:** `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`.\n*   Therefore, `6mc² = 2E_γ`, which means the energy of each individual photon is `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n**3. Calculate Initial Relativistic Momentum**\n\nMomentum is a vector quantity. The magnitude of a particle's relativistic momentum is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n*   Let's define the electron's direction (from left to right) as the positive direction.\n*   **Electron's Momentum:** `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`.\n*   **Positron's Momentum:** It moves in the opposite (negative) direction. `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum:** The net momentum of the system is the vector sum, which lies entirely along the horizontal axis:\n    `P_initial = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\n**4. Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\n\nThe total initial momentum must be equal to the total final momentum of the two photons.\n*   The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Using the photon energy from Step 2, the momentum of each photon is `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n*   Since the initial momentum had no vertical component, the final vertical components must cancel out. This implies the photons are emitted at symmetric angles `+θ` and `-θ` relative to the horizontal axis. The angle between the photons is `2θ`.\n*   The final momentum in the horizontal direction is the sum of the horizontal components of the two photon momenta: `P_final = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n*   Equating initial and final horizontal momenta: `P_initial = P_final`.\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n\n**5. Solve for the Angle**\n\nNow we can substitute the value of `p_γ` into the equation and solve for `θ`.\n*   Substitute `p_γ = 3mc`:\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`.\n*   Cancel the `mc` term from both sides:\n    `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`.\n*   Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n*   The angle we want is `2θ`. First, find `θ` by taking the inverse cosine, and then double it.\n    `Angle = 2θ = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`.\n\n**6. Numerical Calculation**\n\nCalculating the value of this expression:\n*   `Angle ≈ 2 * arccos((3.873 - 1.732) / 6)`\n*   `Angle ≈ 2 * arccos(2.141 / 6)`\n*   `Angle ≈ 2 * arccos(0.3568)`\n*   `Angle ≈ 2 * 69.1°`\n*   `Angle ≈ 138.2°`\n\nThe more precise calculation confirmed by the agents' code executions is approximately `138.19°`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated angle is `138.19°`, which rounds to `138°`.

Conservation of Relativistic Energy**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total energy of the electron-positron system *before* the collision. The energy of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the particle's rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Electron's Energy:** Given its Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`, its energy is `E_e = 4mc²`.\n*   **Positron's Energy:** The positron is the electron's antiparticle, so it has the same rest mass `m`. Given its Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`, its energy is `E_p = 2mc²`.\n*   **Total Initial Energy:** The total energy of the system is the sum of their individual energies:\n    `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\nAfter annihilation, this energy is converted into two photons of equal energy, `E_γ`.\n*   **Total Final Energy:** `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n*   According to the conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`.\n    `6mc² = 2E_γ`, which means the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n**2. Conservation of Relativistic Momentum**\n\nNext, we calculate the total momentum of the system before the collision. Momentum is a vector. Let's define the direction of the incoming electron (from the left) as the positive x-axis. The formula for the magnitude of a particle's relativistic momentum is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n\n*   **Electron's Momentum:** Moving in the +x direction.\n    `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`.\n*   **Positron's Momentum:** Moving in the -x direction.\n    `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum:** The net momentum is the vector sum, which lies entirely along the x-axis:\n    `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (mc√15) - (mc√3) = mc(√15 - √3)`.\n\nThis initial momentum must be equal to the total momentum of the two photons after the annihilation.\n*   **Photon Momentum:** The magnitude of a photon's momentum is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. From our energy calculation, this is `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n*   To conserve momentum in the direction perpendicular to the initial motion (the y-direction), the photons must be emitted at symmetric angles relative to the x-axis. Let this angle be `θ` for the upper photon and `-θ` for the lower one.\n*   **Total Final Momentum (x-component):** `P_final_x = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n*   Equating initial and final momentum along the x-axis:\n    `mc(√15 - √3) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n\n**3. Solving for the Angle**\n\nNow we can substitute `p_γ = 3mc` into our momentum equation:\n*   `mc(√15 - √3) = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`.\n*   We can cancel `mc` from both sides: `(√15 - √3) = 6cos(θ)`.\n*   This gives us `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`. Therefore, we need to calculate `Angle = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`.\n\nThe code execution performed this calculation:\n*   `Angle ≈ 138.19°`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 96\nB) 138\nC) 172\nD) 74\n\nThe calculated value of `138.19°` is closest to **138**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step application of the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity. An analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the correct method and final numerical value.\n\n**1. Summary of Physical Principles**\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of the electron and positron before the collision must equal the total energy of the two photons created after the annihilation. The energy of a massive particle is `E = γmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Momentum:** The total momentum of the electron and positron before the collision must equal the total momentum of the two photons. The momentum of a massive particle is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector quantity.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`)**\n    Let `m` be the rest mass of the electron (and positron) and `c` be the speed of light.\n    *   Energy of the electron (`γ_e = 4`): `E_e = 4mc²`\n    *   Energy of the positron (`γ_p = 2`): `E_p = 2mc²`\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum: `E_initial = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate Energy of Each Photon (`E_γ`)**\n    The total initial energy is converted into two photons of equal energy.\n    *   `E_initial = E_final = 2E_γ`\n    *   `6mc² = 2E_γ`\n    *   Therefore, the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`)**\n    Momentum is a vector. We'll define the direction of the electron as positive (+x). The positron moves in the negative direction (-x).\n    *   Momentum of the electron: `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`\n    *   Momentum of the positron: `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`\n    *   The total initial momentum is the vector sum, which lies entirely on the x-axis: `P_initial = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Apply Momentum Conservation to find the angle**\n    The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Using the result from Step 2, `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n    *   Since the initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction is zero, the two photons must fly off at symmetric angles (`+θ` and `-θ`) to the horizontal axis to conserve y-momentum. The angle *between* them is `2θ`.\n    *   The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the photons' momenta: `P_final = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n    *   Equating initial and final momentum: `P_initial = P_final`\n        `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`\n\n*   **Step 5: Solve for the Angle `2θ`**\n    1.  Cancel `mc` from both sides: `√15 - √3 = 6 cos(θ)`\n    2.  Solve for `cos(θ)`: `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n    3.  Calculate the angle between the photons, `2θ`:\n        Angle = `2θ = 2 * arccos( (√15 - √3) / 6 )`\n    4.  Numerically, this value is: `Angle ≈ 138.19°`\n\n**3.

Apply Energy Conservation to Final State**\nThe annihilation produces two photons of equal energy (`E_γ`).\n*   **Total Final Energy (`E_final`):** `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n*   By conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`:\n    `6mc² = 2E_γ`\n    This gives the energy of each photon as `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n**4. Calculate Initial Momentum**\nThe magnitude of a relativistic particle's momentum is given by `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector quantity. Let's define the electron's direction (from left to right) as the positive x-axis.\n*   **Electron's Momentum (`p_e`):** `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`.\n*   **Positron's Momentum (`p_p`):** It moves in the opposite direction, so its momentum is negative. `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`):** The net momentum is the vector sum, which is entirely along the x-axis.\n    `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\n**5.

Using the energy found in step 3, the momentum of each photon is `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n*   The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction was zero. To conserve y-momentum, the two photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal (x) axis. Let this angle be `θ`.\n*   The total final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of each photon's momentum: `P_final_x = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n*   Equating the initial and final momentum in the x-direction:\n    `P_initial = P_final_x`\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γcos(θ)`\n*   Substitute the value of `p_γ = 3mc`:\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`\n\n**6.

Apply Conservation of Momentum to Find the Angle**\n\n*   The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction was zero.

The correct approach, as identified by a strong consensus among the candidate answers, is to apply the laws of conservation of relativistic energy and conservation of relativistic momentum.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Initial State of the System\nWe must first determine the total energy and total momentum of the electron and positron before they collide. Let `m` be the rest mass of an electron (which is the same as for a positron) and `c` be the speed of light.\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (`E_i`):**\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc²`.\n    *   Energy of the electron (`γ_e = 4`): `E_e = 4mc²`\n    *   Energy of the positron (`γ_p = 2`): `E_p = 2mc²`\n    *   Total initial energy is the sum: `E_i = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_i`):**\n    *   The relativistic momentum of a particle is given by `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector.\n    *   Let the electron's direction be the positive (+) x-axis. Its momentum is: `p_e = mc√(4² - 1) = mc√15`.\n    *   The positron moves in the opposite, negative (-) x-axis direction. Its momentum is: `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`.\n    *   The total initial momentum is the vector sum, which lies entirely along the x-axis: `P_i = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Final State and Apply Conservation Laws\nThe system annihilates into two photons of equal energy, `E_γ`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total final energy is `E_f = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n    *   Setting initial energy equal to final energy: `6mc² = 2E_γ`, which means the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Substituting the photon energy, we get `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n    *   The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction was zero. To conserve momentum, the photons must be emitted at symmetric angles `+θ` and `-θ` relative to the horizontal axis.\n    *   The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the photon momenta: `P_f = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n    *   Setting initial momentum equal to final momentum: `(√15 - √3)mc = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n\n### 4. Solve for the Angle\nNow we substitute the photon momentum `p_γ = 3mc` into the equation and solve for the angle.\n\n1.  `(√15 - √3)mc = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ)`\n2.  The `mc` terms cancel out: `√15 - √3 = 6 * cos(θ)`\n3.  Solve for `cos(θ)`: `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n4.  The angle asked for is the total angle *between* the photons, which is `2θ`.\n5.  `Total Angle = 2θ = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`\n\n### 5. Numerical Calculation and Conclusion\nA calculation of the expression `2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)` gives an angle of approximately **138.19°**.\n\nThis result is supported by the overwhelming consensus of calculations from the candidate answers.

Let the electron's direction be positive. The relativistic momentum is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n    *   Total initial momentum `P_initial = (mc√(4² - 1)) - (mc√(2² - 1)) = (√15 - √3)mc`. This momentum is entirely along the horizontal axis.\n    *   For each photon, the momentum magnitude is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3mc`.\n    *   To conserve momentum in the vertical direction, the photons must be emitted at symmetric angles `θ` and `-θ` to the horizontal axis.\n    *   The final total momentum along the horizontal axis is `P_final = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n    *   Equating initial and final momentum: `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Angle:**\n    *   Simplifying the equation gives `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n    *   The question asks for the total angle between the photons, which is `2θ`.\n    *   Therefore, the angle is `2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`.\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   The Python code execution provides a precise value: `138.189685...` degrees.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   The calculated angle is approximately `138.19°`.\n    *   The options provided are: A) 74, B) 96, C) 138, D) 172.\n    *   The calculated value `138.19°` is closest to **138**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principles:** The problem describes a high-speed particle collision and subsequent annihilation. The laws that govern this process are the **conservation of relativistic energy** and the **conservation of relativistic momentum**, as correctly identified by all sound analyses.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Initial Energy:**\n    The energy of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   **Electron:** With `γ_e = 4`, its energy is `E_e = 4mc²`.\n    *   **Positron:** With `γ_p = 2`, its energy is `E_p = 2mc²`.\n    *   **Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`):** The total energy is the sum of the individual energies:\n        `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\n3.  **Apply Energy Conservation to the Final State:**\n    The initial energy is converted into two photons of equal energy (`E_γ`).\n    *   The total final energy is `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n    *   By energy conservation (`E_initial = E_final`): `6mc² = 2E_γ`.\n    *   Solving for the energy of a single photon gives `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Initial Momentum:**\n    The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by the formula `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.

Both photons have this momentum magnitude.\n    *   The initial momentum in the y-direction (perpendicular to the collision axis) was zero.

It moves from left to right (let's define this as the +x direction).\n    *   A positron (rest mass `m`, charge +e) has a Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`. It moves from right to left (the -x direction).\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Relativistic Energy:**\n    *   The energy of a relativistic particle is `E = γmc²`.\n    *   The total initial energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two particles:\n        `E_initial = E_electron + E_positron = γ_e mc² + γ_p mc² = (4 + 2)mc² = 6mc²`.\n    *   This energy is converted into two photons of equal energy, `E_γ`.\n    *   The total final energy is `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n    *   By conserving energy, `E_initial = E_final`:\n        `6mc² = 2E_γ`, which means the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Relativistic Momentum:**\n    *   Momentum is a vector quantity. The momentum of a relativistic particle is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n    *   The initial momentum of the electron (in the +x direction) is:\n        `p_electron = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`.\n    *   The initial momentum of the positron (in the -x direction) is:\n        `p_positron = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`.\n    *   The total initial momentum is the vector sum, which is entirely along the x-axis:\n        `P_initial = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n    *   The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Using the result from energy conservation, the magnitude of each photon's momentum is:\n        `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n    *   Since the initial momentum had no vertical component (no y-component), the final vertical momenta must also sum to zero. This implies the two photons are emitted at symmetric angles relative to the horizontal axis: one at an angle `+θ` and the other at `-θ`.\n    *   The final total momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photon momenta:\n        `P_final = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n    *   By conserving momentum, `P_initial = P_final`:\n        `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Angle:**\n    *   Substitute the value `p_γ = 3mc` into the momentum equation:\n        `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`.\n    *   Cancel the common term `mc` from both sides:\n        `√15 - √3 = 6 cos(θ)`.\n    *   Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n        `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n    *   The question asks for the total angle *between* the photons, which is `θ - (-θ) = 2θ`.\n        `Angle = 2θ = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`.\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    To find the numerical value, we can use the following calculation:\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Calculate the argument for arccos\n    cos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n    # Calculate theta in radians\n    theta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n    # Convert theta to degrees\n    theta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n    # The total angle is 2 times theta\n    total_angle_deg = 2 * theta_deg\n    print(total_angle_deg)\n    ```\n    The calculation gives an angle of approximately 138.19°.\n\n6.  **Final Decision:**\n    The calculated angle is ~138.19°.
