    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an uncharged, spherical conductor. This means its net electric charge is zero. Inside this conductor, there is a cavity. A positive point charge, `+q`, is placed somewhere inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field `E` at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   To find the charge on the inner surface of the cavity, we can use Gauss's Law. Let's imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity.\n    *   A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero.\n    *   Therefore, the electric flux through our imaginary Gaussian surface is zero.\n    *   Gauss's Law states that the net electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge ($Φ_E = Q_{enc} / \\epsilon_o$). Since the flux is zero, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed in the cavity (`+q`) and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    *   So, `+q + q_{inner} = 0`, which implies `q_{inner} = -q`. A total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Conservation:** The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge of 0). Since a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface, a corresponding charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall neutrality. This `+q` charge will reside on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding. A closed conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. The combined electric field from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner wall is exactly zero for all points outside the cavity.\n    *   This means that the charge `+q` on the outer surface is not influenced by the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity, nor by the position or shape of the cavity itself.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself in a way that minimizes electrostatic potential energy. Since the outer surface is a sphere and it is shielded from any fields originating from within the cavity, the charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over the outer spherical surface of radius `R`.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at P:** The total electric field at point P is the superposition of the fields created by all charges: the `+q` in the cavity, the `-q` on the inner surface, and the `+q` on the outer surface.\n    *   As established by the shielding principle, the net field from the `+q` in the cavity and the `-q` on the inner surface is zero at point P (which is outside the conductor).\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at P is solely due to the uniform distribution of charge `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   A well-known result from Gauss's Law (also known as Newton's shell theorem for electricity) is that the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is given as `L`.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion on extraneous information:** The problem provides several other details: the cavity radius `r`, the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center `s`, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to point P, and the angle `θ`. Based on the reasoning above, all of these details are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor. They are included to test the understanding of the fundamental principles of electrostatics, particularly shielding by conductors.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n\nOur derived result matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
