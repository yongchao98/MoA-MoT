    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It has the structure CH3CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH2CH3, where the two propyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. (E)-oct-4-ene is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  Treatment with one equivalent of mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid). This is an epoxidation reaction, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (H3O+). This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. Water acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons, leading to a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups). The ring-opening occurs with anti-stereochemistry relative to the epoxide oxygen.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene (addition of two -OH groups to opposite faces of the original double bond).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical outcome of an addition reaction depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene. A well-established rule in stereochemistry states that the **anti-addition to a trans-alkene produces a meso compound**.\n    *   (E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso-diol\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers, but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nLet's call this product **Compound M**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. The two propyl groups are on the same side of the double bond. (Z)-oct-4-ene is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H3O+), so the overall transformation is again **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We apply the stereochemical rule for anti-addition to a cis-alkene: the **anti-addition to a cis-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers**.\n    *   (Z)-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture (enantiomers)\n*   **Products of Reaction 2:** The products are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are formed in equal amounts (a 1:1 racemic mixture).\n\nLet's call these products **Compound R** ((4R,5R)-diol) and **Compound S** ((4S,5S)-diol).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **Compound M:** (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound)\n2.  **Compound R:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n3.  **Compound S:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   Compound R and Compound S are **enantiomers**.\n*   Compound M is a **diastereomer** of Compound R.\n*   Compound M is also a **diastereomer** of Compound S.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of peaks observed in two types of HPLC analysis, assuming perfect resolution.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like R and S) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute at the same time, producing a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like M versus R or M versus S) have different physical properties. Therefore, they can be separated by an achiral column and will elute at different times, producing **separate peaks**.\n    *   In our mixture, Compound M will be separated from the pair of (R + S). This results in two signals.\n    *   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** There will be **2 peaks**. One peak for Compound M, and one peak for the co-eluting enantiomers R and S.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC column:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer of a chiral pair.\n    *   Therefore, a chiral column can separate **enantiomers**. Compounds R and S will have different retention times and will produce **two separate peaks**.\n    *   A chiral column can also separate **diastereomers**. Compound M, being a diastereomer of R and S, will also have a unique retention time and produce its own peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** All three distinct stereoisomers (M, R, and S) will be resolved. There will be **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   Standard (achiral) HPLC: **2 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **3 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
