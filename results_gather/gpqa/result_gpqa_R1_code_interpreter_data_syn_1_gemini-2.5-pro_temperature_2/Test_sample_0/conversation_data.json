    "This problem can be solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Understand the core concept:** The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that for a quantum state, there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Relate the principle to the problem:** The \"lifetime\" (τ) of a quantum state can be considered as the time interval Δt during which the state exists. The uncertainty in its energy, ΔE, corresponds to the natural energy width (or \"blurriness\") of the energy level. A shorter lifetime leads to a larger energy width, making the energy level less precisely defined. The relationship is often approximated as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Identify the goal:** We want to \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, E1 and E2. This means the separation between the centers of the two energy levels, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than their individual energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this larger width is the main limiting factor for resolution.\n\n4.  **Calculate the energy widths (ΔE) for both states:**\n    *   **State 1:** Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   **State 2:** Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   **Constant:** Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    *   **Energy width of State 1 (ΔE1):**\n        ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **Energy width of State 2 (ΔE2):**\n        ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Apply the resolvability criterion:** To clearly resolve the two levels, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger of the two energy widths.\n    *   Comparing the widths: ΔE1 (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is larger than ΔE2 (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV).\n    *   Therefore, the condition for resolvability is:\n        |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given options against the criterion:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV:  Is 10⁻⁴ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? Yes. (10⁻⁴ = 1000 x 10⁻⁷)\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV: Is 10⁻¹¹ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV:  Is 10⁻⁸ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No. (10⁻⁸ = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV:  Is 10⁻⁹ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No. (10⁻⁹ = 0.01 x 10⁻⁷)\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Only option A provides an energy difference large enough to resolve the two energy levels, as it is significantly larger than the natural energy width of both states.\n\nI will use a Python script to verify these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Given lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate energy uncertainty (width) for each state.
