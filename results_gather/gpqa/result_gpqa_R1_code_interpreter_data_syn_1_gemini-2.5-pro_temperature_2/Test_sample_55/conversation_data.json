    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process and Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay process of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |3,0,0> to the final state |1,0,0> via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies there is an intermediate state.\n\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole (E1) transition between an initial state |n,l,m> and a final state |n',l',m'> are:\n1.  **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number (l):** Δl = l' - l = ±1.\n2.  **Change in magnetic quantum number (m):** Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1.\n3.  **Parity change:** The parity of the wavefunction, given by (-1)^l, must change. This is automatically satisfied if Δl = ±1.\n\n### 2. First Transition: |3,0,0> → Intermediate State\n\n*   **Initial state:** |i> = |3,0,0> (n=3, l=0, m=0).\n*   Applying the selection rules for Δl: The final l' must be l ± 1 = 0 ± 1. Since l must be non-negative, the intermediate state must have l_intermediate = 1.\n*   Applying the selection rules for Δm: The final m' can be m ± 1 or m. So, m_intermediate = 0 ± 1 or 0, which means m_intermediate can be -1, 0, or +1.\n*   For a decay, the principal quantum number n must decrease. The options suggest the intermediate state has n=2.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. These correspond to the three `2p` orbitals.\n\n### 3. Second Transition: Intermediate State → |1,0,0>\n\nLet's check if the second transition from these possible intermediate states to the final state |1,0,0> is allowed.\n*   **Final state:** |f> = |1,0,0> (n=1, l=0, m=0).\n*   **Intermediate states:** |2,1,m_intermediate>.\n*   Applying selection rules:\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m_intermediate. For this to be allowed, Δm must be 0, ±1. This means m_intermediate must be 0, ±1.\n\nAll three possible intermediate states (|2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>) can decay to |1,0,0> via an E1 transition. This means all three cascade routes are possible:\n*   Route A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n*   Route B: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n*   Route C: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n\n### 4. Calculating the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. In this context, this is the branching ratio for the first step of the decay. The atom starts in |3,0,0> and must decay. The probability of it taking a specific channel (e.g., via the |2,1,0> state) is the rate of that specific decay divided by the total decay rate.\n\nThe spontaneous emission rate (A) from an initial state |i> to a final state |f> is given by Fermi's Golden Rule and is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment matrix element:\n`A(i→f) ∝ |<f| e**r** |i>|²`\n\nwhere **r** is the position operator.\n\nThe total decay rate from |3,0,0> is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. As established by the selection rules, the only E1 decays from the `3s` state are to `p` states. The decay to the `2p` state is energetically the most favored. Let's assume decay to `np` states with n>2 is negligible (which is a very good approximation).\n`Γ_total ≈ A(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>) + A(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) + A(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>)`\n\nThe branching ratio (probability) for the path via |2,1,m'> is:\n`P(m') = A(|3,0,0>→|2,1,m'>) / Γ_total`\n\nWe need to calculate the relative values of `A(|3,0,0>→|2,1,m'>)` for m' = -1, 0, 1. The rate is proportional to `|<2,1,m'| **r** |3,0,0>|²`. This matrix element can be separated into a radial part and an angular part. Since the initial and final `n` and `l` quantum numbers are the same for all three transitions, the radial part `|<R_21|r|R_30>|²` is the same for all. We only need to compare the angular parts: `|<Y_1,m'| **r_hat** |Y_0,0>|²`, where `**r_hat**` is the unit position vector.\n\nLet's compute this for each m':\nThe components of the position vector can be written in terms of spherical harmonics.\n`z = r cos(θ) ∝ r Y_1,0(θ,φ)`\n`x = r sin(θ)cos(φ) ∝ r (Y_1,-1 - Y_1,1)`\n`y = r sin(θ)sin(φ) ∝ ir (Y_1,-1 + Y_1,1)`\nThe initial state angular wavefunction is `Y_0,0 = 1/√(4π)`, which is a constant.\n\n*   **For m' = 0 (transition to |2,1,0>):** The matrix element `|<Y_1,0| **r_hat** |Y_0,0>|²` is non-zero only for the z-component of **r**. The squared value of the angular integral is `|<Y_1,0|cos(θ)|Y_0,0>|² = 1/3`.\n\n*   **For m' = 1 (transition to |2,1,1>):** The matrix element `|<Y_1,1| **r_hat** |Y_0,0>|²` is non-zero only for x and y components. The sum of the squares of the angular integrals `|<Y_1,1|sin(θ)cos(φ)|Y_0,0>|² + |<Y_1,1|sin(θ)sin(φ)|Y_0,0>|²` is `1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3`.\n\n*   **For m' = -1 (transition to |2,1,-1>):** Similarly, the sum of squares of the angular integrals is `|<Y_1,-1|sin(θ)cos(φ)|Y_0,0>|² + |<Y_1,-1|sin(θ)sin(φ)|Y_0,0>|²` is `1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3`.\n\nSince the angular part is the same (1/3) for all three transitions, and all other factors (radial integral, frequency term) are also the same, the transition rates are equal:\n`A(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>) = A(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) = A(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>)`\n\nLet `A_0` be this common rate. Then the total rate is `Γ_total = A_0 + A_0 + A_0 = 3A_0`.\nThe probability of decaying into any one specific m' channel is:\n`P(m') = A_0 / (3A_0) = 1/3`\n\nOnce the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'> states, the only allowed E1 decay channel is to the |1,0,0> state. Thus, the probability of this second step is 1.\n\nTherefore, the total probability for each of the three possible cascade paths is 1/3.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nLet's check the given options:\n*   A) `|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0>` and probability `1/4`. My calculated probability is 1/3.

    "The problem asks for the decay route and the corresponding probability for the transition from the state |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via a two-step electric dipole (E1) transition.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Understand Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:**\n    For an E1 transition from an initial state `|n,l,m>` to a final state `|n',l',m'>`, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   **Δl = l' - l = ±1:** The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one unit.\n    *   **Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1:** The magnetic quantum number must change by at most one unit.\n    *   **Parity Change:** The parity of the state, given by (-1)<sup>l</sup>, must change. This condition is automatically fulfilled if Δl = ±1.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Transition: |3,0,0> → Intermediate State**\n    *   The initial state is `|i> = |3,0,0>`, so n=3, l=0, m=0.\n    *   Applying the Δl selection rule: `l_intermediate = l ± 1 = 0 ± 1`. Since `l` cannot be negative, the intermediate state must have `l_intermediate = 1`.\n    *   Applying the Δm selection rule: `m_intermediate = m + Δm = 0 + (0, ±1)`. So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are `m_intermediate = -1, 0, +1`.\n    *   For a decay, the principal quantum number must decrease. The options provided suggest that the intermediate state has `n=2`. This is a valid decay from `n=3`.\n    *   Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states: `|2,1,-1>`, `|2,1,0>`, and `|2,1,1>`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State → |1,0,0>**\n    *   The final state is `|f> = |1,0,0>`, so n=1, l=0, m=0.\n    *   Let's check the transition from our possible intermediate states `|2,1,m_intermediate>` to the final state.\n    *   Applying the Δl selection rule: `Δl = l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1`. This is allowed.\n    *   Applying the Δm selection rule: `Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m_intermediate`. This implies that `m_intermediate` can be 0 or ±1, which is consistent with the possibilities we found for the first step.\n    *   This confirms that all three cascade routes are possible according to selection rules:\n        *   `|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>`\n        *   `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>`\n        *   `|3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n    The probability of the atom taking a specific path is determined by the branching ratio of the first decay step. The rate of a spontaneous emission `A` is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment: `A ∝ |<f| e**r** |i>|²`.\n\n    We need to compare the rates of the three possible first-step transitions:\n    *   `A_1: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>`\n    *   `A_2: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>`\n    *   `A_3: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1>`\n\n    The total decay rate from `|3,0,0>` to the `n=2` states is `A_total = A_1 + A_2 + A_3`.\n    The probability (branching ratio) for the atom to decay via the intermediate state `|2,1,m'>` is `P(m') = A_m' / A_total`.\n\n    The Wigner-Eckart theorem tells us that for an unpolarized initial state (like the `l=0` spherically symmetric state), the decay rates to the different `m'` substates of a given `l'` level are equal. Let's briefly show this:\n\n    The rate is proportional to the sum over all polarizations of the squared matrix element. For an `s` to `p` transition (`l=0` to `l=1`), the calculation shows that the strength of the transition is independent of the final `m'` state.\n    \n    *   `Rate(|3s> → |2p_{m'=-1}>) ∝ |<2,1,-1| x+iy |3,0,0>|²`\n    *   `Rate(|3s> → |2p_{m'=0}>) ∝ |<2,1,0| z |3,0,0>|²`\n    *   `Rate(|3s> → |2p_{m'=1}>) ∝ |<2,1,1| x-iy |3,0,0>|²`\n    \n    Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial `|3,0,0>` state, there is no preferred direction of decay. Therefore, the transition probabilities to the three degenerate states `|2,1,-1>`, `|2,1,0>`, and `|2,1,1>` must be equal.\n\n    So, `A_1 = A_2 = A_3`. Let's call this common rate `A`.\n    The total rate is `A_total = A + A + A = 3A`.\n    The probability of decaying into any one of these specific states is:\n    `P = A / A_total = A / (3A) = 1/3`.\n\n    Once the atom is in any of the `|2,1,m'>` states, the only allowed E1 decay channel is to the `|1,0,0>` ground state. Thus, the probability of the second step is 1.\n    The overall probability of the specific cascade `|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>` is `(1/3) * 1 = 1/3`.\n\n5.  **Match with the Options:**\n    We look for an option that has a valid transition path and a probability of 1/3.\n    *   A) `|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0>` and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n    *   B) `|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>` and 1/3 (Correct path and probability)\n    *   C) `|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0>` and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n    *   D) `>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>` and 2/3 (Incorrect probability and typo in the state)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
