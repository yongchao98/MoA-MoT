    "The user wants me to identify a biological process based on an experimental description.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experiment:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (delivered orally, mimicking natural infection).\n    *   **Location:** The process is observed in Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, a key site for mucosal immune responses.\n    *   **Cells:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. Proliferation (clonal expansion) is a hallmark of an adaptive immune response, specifically of B and T cells that have recognized their cognate antigen.\n    *   **Key Molecular Finding:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" from these cells reveals \"high variability.\" This is the most critical piece of information. The heavy chain gene is part of the B cell receptor (BCR) and the antibodies B cells eventually secrete. The \"variable\" part is what binds to the antigen.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in developing B cells (pro-B and pre-B cells) within the *primary* lymphoid organs (bone marrow). The experiment describes an event happening in a *secondary* lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch) *after* encountering an antigen. Therefore, VDJ recombination has already happened long before this stage. This is not the correct process.\n\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes of B cells that have been activated by an antigen. It occurs within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). The goal is to produce B cells with higher affinity for the antigen (affinity maturation). This process directly leads to \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of a \"proliferating cell population\" in a Peyer's patch after antigen exposure. This fits the description perfectly.\n\n    *   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, switching the antibody class (e.g., from IgM to IgA). While this also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers and would be expected in response to a gut pathogen (switching to IgA is common for mucosal immunity), it does not affect the *variable* region. The question specifically highlights variability in the *variable* gene, making SHM the more direct and accurate answer to the specific observation provided.\n\n    *   **D) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system (a protein cascade in the blood and tissues) and has nothing to do with generating genetic variability in the heavy chain genes of lymphocytes.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells within a Peyer's patch following antigen challenge is the textbook definition of somatic hypermutation occurring during a germinal center reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
