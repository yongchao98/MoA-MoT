    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   The formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   First, calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or double bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong intensity bands):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (above 3300 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A secondary amine (-NHR) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine would show none.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong band):** This absorption is in the typical range for a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. The position is consistent with an ester, especially one that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring, which lowers the frequency from the typical ~1740 cm⁻¹ for a saturated ester.\n\n**Summary from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) group and a carbonyl (C=O) group, likely part of a conjugated ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates three equivalent protons, characteristic of a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule implies this methyl group is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH2- group). This triplet at ~1.2 ppm is a classic sign of an ethyl group.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two equivalent protons, characteristic of a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule implies this methylene group is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a -CH3 group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield (deshielded) position for a -CH2- group, indicating it's attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen.\n    *   **Conclusion for 1.20 & 4.5 ppm signals:** The triplet and quartet together confirm the presence of an **ethoxy group (-O-CH2CH3)**. The structure is specifically -O-CH2-CH3, not -CO-CH2-CH3, due to the high chemical shift of the -CH2- protons.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** This broadness is typical for protons on heteroatoms (like N or O) that can undergo chemical exchange. Combined with the IR data, this signal is confidently assigned to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH2)** group.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This region is characteristic of aromatic protons.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are four protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern (two doublets):** This simple A2B2 pattern (or more accurately, an AA'BB' system that appears as two doublets) is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly deshielded by a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester, -COOR). The protons at 7.0 ppm are relatively shielded by an electron-donating group (like the amine, -NH2).\n\n**4. Assembling the Pieces and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the spectral analysis, we have the following structural fragments:\n*   An ethoxy group: -OCH2CH3\n*   A primary amine group: -NH2\n*   A carbonyl group: -C=O\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nThe only way to assemble these pieces to match the formula C9H11NO2 is to form **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure has all the required features: a para-disubstituted ring, a primary amine, and an ethyl ester group. The electron-withdrawing ester (-COOEt) would make the ortho protons appear downfield (~8.0 ppm), and the electron-donating amine (-NH2) would make its ortho protons appear upfield (~7.0 ppm, although more shielded than in this case due to the opposing group). The ethoxy and amine signals also match perfectly. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted ring (would give a more complex NMR spectrum), and it's an amide, not an ester. The C=O IR frequency for an amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) is lower than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹. Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has the ester linkage reversed (O-CO-R vs. CO-O-R). The -CH2- group would be next to the carbonyl, giving a chemical shift of ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. The C=O IR frequency for a phenyl ester is typically higher (~1760 cm⁻¹). Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two. The NMR would also show a secondary amine proton (1H) and a formyl proton (-CHO, ~8.2 ppm, 1H singlet), neither of which are observed. Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll spectroscopic data point unambiguously to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
