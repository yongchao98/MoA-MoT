    "Here is the reasoning and the thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are given a system of two astronauts with different masses and velocities.\n*   Astronaut 1: mass `m1 = 2m`, velocity `v1 = 0.6c` in the +x direction.\n*   Astronaut 2: mass `m2 = 3m`, velocity `v2 = 0.5c` in the +x direction.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\nWe need to find two quantities:\n1.  **The relative speed (`v_rel`)** between the two astronauts.\n2.  **The total energy (`E_total`)** of the system as observed in the initial (lab) frame of reference.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Relative Speed (`v_rel`)\n\nSince the velocities are relativistic (a significant fraction of the speed of light), we must use the relativistic velocity addition/subtraction formula. The formula to find the velocity of object 1 relative to object 2 (both moving in the same direction) is:\n\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - (0.3 * c^2) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c`\n\nNow, let's find the decimal value of 1/7:\n`1 / 7 ≈ 0.142857...`\n\nSo, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Total Energy (`E_total`)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts. The total relativistic energy of a single particle is given by the formula:\n\n`E = γ * m_0 * c^2`\n\nwhere `m_0` is the rest mass and `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is defined as:\n\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)`\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and then add them up.\n\n**For Astronaut 1:**\n*   `m1 = 2m`\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Calculate `γ1`:\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / 0.8`\n    `γ1 = 1.25`\n*   Calculate `E1`:\n    `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2`\n    `E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2`\n    `E1 = 2.5 * mc^2`\n\n**For Astronaut 2:**\n*   `m2 = 3m`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   Calculate `γ2`:\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / (sqrt(3) / 2)`\n    `γ2 = 2 / sqrt(3)`\n    `γ2 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Calculate `E2`:\n    `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2`\n    `E2 = (2 / sqrt(3)) * (3m) * c^2`\n    `E2 = (6 / sqrt(3)) * mc^2`\n    `E2 = 2 * sqrt(3) * mc^2`\n    `E2 ≈ 2 * 1.732 * mc^2`\n    `E2 ≈ 3.464 * mc^2`\n\n**Total Energy (`E_total`):**\n*   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n*   `E_total = 2.5 * mc^2 + 2 * sqrt(3) * mc^2`\n*   `E_total = (2.5 + 2 * sqrt(3)) * mc^2`\n*   `E_total ≈ (2.5 + 3.464) * mc^2`\n*   `E_total ≈ 5.964 * mc^2`\n\n### 4. Conclusion and Comparison with Options\n\nOur calculated values are:\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`\n\nNow we compare these with the given options:\nA) `v_rel = 1.1c`, `E = mc^2` -> Incorrect.\nB) `v_rel = 0.14c`, `E = 5mc^2` -> `v_rel` is correct, but `E` is incorrect (It seems to be only the rest mass energy).\nC) `v_rel = 0.14c`, `E = 5.96 mc^2` -> Both values match our calculations.\nD) `v_rel = 0.1c`, `E = 4.96 mc^2` -> Incorrect (`v_rel` is the classical approximation).\n\nTo be certain of the numerical calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Problem Parameters ---\n# Astronaut 1\nm1_factor = 2.0\nv1 = 0.6  # in units of c\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2_factor = 3.0\nv2 = 0.5  # in units of c\n\n# --- Calculation of Relative Speed ---\n# v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2)\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1 * v2)\n\n# --- Calculation of Total Energy ---\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2)\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\n\n# E = gamma * m_factor\nE1_factor = gamma1 * m1_factor\nE2_factor = gamma2 * m2_factor\n\n# E_total = E1 + E2\nE_total_factor = E1_factor + E2_factor\n\n# --- Output the results ---\nprint(f\"The relative speed is {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"The total energy is {E_total_factor:.2f}mc^2\")\n```\n>>>\nThe relative speed is 0.14c\nThe total energy is 5.96mc^2\n<<<C>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the relative speed and the total energy of the system using the principles of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Calculation of Relative Speed (`v_rel`)\n\nThe velocities are relativistic, so we use the Lorentz transformation for velocities. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities `v1` and `v2` in a given reference frame, the relative velocity of `v1` with respect to `v2` is given by the formula:\n\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nGiven:\n*   `v1 = 0.6 c`\n*   `v2 = 0.5 c`\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3 * c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculation of Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The total energy `E` of a particle with rest mass `m₀` moving at a velocity `v` is given by:\n\n`E = γ * m₀ * c²`\n\nwhere `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v² / c²) `\n\nWe calculate the energy for each astronaut and add them.\n\n**For Astronaut 1:**\n*   `m₁ = 2m`\n*   `v₁ = 0.6c`\n*   `γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 * mc²`\n\n**For Astronaut 2:**\n*   `m₂ = 3m`\n*   `v₂ = 0.5c`\n*   `γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641 * mc²`\n\n**Total Energy:**\n*   `E_total = E₁ + E₂`\n*   `E_total = 2.5 * mc² + 3.4641 * mc²`\n*   `E_total = (2.5 + 3.4641) * mc²`\n*   `E_total = 5.9641 * mc²`\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\nComparing our calculated values (`v_rel ≈ 0.14c`, `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`) with the given options, we find that option C matches our results.\n\n<<<C>>>"
