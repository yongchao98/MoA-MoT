    "*   **1. System Description & Single-Particle States:**\n    *   The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being spin-1/2 particles means they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy for a single particle in such a well is quantized and given by:\n        E_n = n^2 * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n    *   The problem defines a base unit of energy E = π²ħ² / 2mL². So, the single-particle energy levels are:\n        E_n = n² * E (where n = 1, 2, 3, ...)\n    *   The complete quantum state for a particle is defined by its principal quantum number *n* and its spin magnetic quantum number *m_s* (which can be +1/2 for \"spin up\" ↑, or -1/2 for \"spin down\" ↓).\n    *   The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. This means for a given energy level *n*, we can have at most two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n*   **2. Ground State Energy (E₀):**\n    *   To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   Level n=1 (Energy E₁ = 1²E = 1E): We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Level n=2 (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E): We place the remaining two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   The ground state configuration is two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=2.\n    *   Total Ground State Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n*   **3. First Excited State Energy (E₁):**\n    *   To get the first excited state, we must create the lowest-energy excitation from the ground state. This involves promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   Ground state configuration: {n=1(↑↓), n=2(↑↓)}\n    *   The highest occupied level is n=2. The lowest unoccupied level is n=3 (Energy E₃ = 3²E = 9E).\n    *   We promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   The first excited state configuration is two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Total First Excited State Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n*   **4. Second Excited State Energy (E₂):**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible low-energy single-particle promotions from the ground state.\n        *   **Ground state config:** {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2}. Energy = 10E.\n        *   **1st excited state config:** {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. Energy = 15E.\n    *   Let's consider possible excitations from the ground state {n=1(2), n=2(2)} to find the next lowest energy state:\n        *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. Configuration: {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n            *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n        *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3. Configuration: {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3}.\n            *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n        *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4. Configuration: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n            *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   Comparing the energies of these possible excited states (18E, 20E, 22E, etc.), the lowest energy after the first excited state (15E) is 18E. Therefore, this is the second excited state.\n\nTo confirm this, the following python code systematically generates all possible valid configurations, calculates their total energies, and identifies the lowest three unique energy values.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_system_energies(num_particles, num_states_to_find):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the lowest energy states for a system of spin-1/2 fermions\n    in a 1D infinite potential well.\n\n    Args:\n        num_particles (int): The number of particles in the system.\n        num_states_to_find (int): The number of lowest energy states to find (e.g., ground, 1st excited, etc.).\n    \"\"\"\n    max_n = num_particles + 3  # Explore a reasonable number of n-levels\n    single_particle_states = []\n    # Each n level has two spin states\n    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        single_particle_states.append({'n': n, 'spin': 'up'})\n        single_particle_states.append({'n': n, 'spin': 'down'})\n\n    # Generate all unique combinations of 'num_particles' states\n    # This automatically handles the Pauli Exclusion Principle\n    all_configs = itertools.combinations(single_particle_states, num_particles)\n\n    energies = set()\n    for config in all_configs:\n        # The energy is the sum of n^2 for each particle in the configuration\n        total_energy = sum(state['n']**2 for state in config)\n        energies.add(total_energy)\n\n    # Sort the unique energies and get the lowest ones\n    sorted_energies = sorted(list(energies))\n    \n    # We want the ground, 1st excited, and 2nd excited states\n    lowest_three_energies = sorted_energies[:num_states_to_find]\n\n    print(f\"Ground state energy: {lowest_three_energies[0]}E\")\n    print(f\"First excited state energy: {lowest_three_energies[1]}E\")\n    print(f\"Second excited state energy: {lowest_three_energies[2]}E\")\n    print(\"---\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer format: {lowest_three_energies[0]}E, {lowest_three_energies[1]}E, {lowest_three_energies[2]}E\")\n\n# For this problem: 4 particles, find the first 3 energy states\nfind_system_energies(num_particles=4, num_states_to_find=3)\n```\n\n>>> Executing code...\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_system_energies(num_particles, num_states_to_find):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the lowest energy states for a system of spin-1/2 fermions\n    in a 1D infinite potential well.\n\n    Args:\n        num_particles (int): The number of particles in the system.\n        num_states_to_find (int): The number of lowest energy states to find (e.g., ground, 1st excited, etc.).\n    \"\"\"\n    max_n = num_particles + 3  # Explore a reasonable number of n-levels\n    single_particle_states = []\n    # Each n level has two spin states\n    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        single_particle_states.append({'n': n, 'spin': 'up'})\n        single_particle_states.append({'n': n, 'spin': 'down'})\n\n    # Generate all unique combinations of 'num_particles' states\n    # This automatically handles the Pauli Exclusion Principle\n    all_configs = itertools.combinations(single_particle_states, num_particles)\n\n    energies = set()\n    for config in all_configs:\n        # The energy is the sum of n^2 for each particle in the configuration\n        total_energy = sum(state['n']**2 for state in config)\n        energies.add(total_energy)\n\n    # Sort the unique energies and get the lowest ones\n    sorted_energies = sorted(list(energies))\n    \n    # We want the ground, 1st excited, and 2nd excited states\n    lowest_three_energies = sorted_energies[:num_states_to_find]\n\n    print(f\"Ground state energy: {lowest_three_energies[0]}E\")\n    print(f\"First excited state energy: {lowest_three_energies[1]}E\")\n    print(f\"Second excited state energy: {lowest_three_energies[2]}E\")\n    print(\"---\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer format: {lowest_three_energies[0]}E, {lowest_three_energies[1]}E, {lowest_three_energies[2]}E\")\n\n# For this problem: 4 particles, find the first 3 energy states\nfind_system_energies(num_particles=4, num_states_to_find=3)\n```\n>>> Execution output:\nGround state energy: 10E\nFirst excited state energy: 15E\nSecond excited state energy: 18E\n---\nFinal Answer format: 10E, 15E, 18E\n\n>>>\n\nThe calculated and code-verified energies are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Understand the Basics**\n\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state here is defined by both the energy level (quantum number *n*) and the spin (up or down). This means each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n*   **Energy Levels:** For a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the energy levels are given by:\n    E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem conveniently defines a base energy unit E = π²ħ² / 2mL². So, the single-particle energy levels are:\n    *   n = 1: E₁ = 1²E = 1E\n    *   n = 2: E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n    *   n = 3: E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n    *   n = 4: E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n    *   and so on...\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy 1E):** We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy 4E):** We place the remaining two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nTo get the first excited state, we must create the lowest-energy possible excitation from the ground state. This involves promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground state configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two in n=2.\n*   **Highest occupied level:** n=2.\n*   **Lowest unoccupied level:** n=3.\n*   **Excitation:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n*   **New configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider the possible low-energy promotions from the ground state:\n\n*   **Promotion 1 (already found):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E (This is the 1st excited state).\n*   **Promotion 2:** Promote one particle from a lower level, e.g., from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Promotion 3:** Promote one particle from n=2 to a higher level, n=4.\n    *   Configuration: Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   **Promotion 4:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: Two in n=1, two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\nComparing the possible excitation energies (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 10E (ground), the next is 15E (first excited), and the next lowest is 18E.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
