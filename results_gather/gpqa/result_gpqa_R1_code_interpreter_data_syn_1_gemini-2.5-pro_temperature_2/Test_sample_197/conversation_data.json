    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical system:** We have a solution containing cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) and thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`). These react to form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]^+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]^-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`.\n\n2.  **Define the stability constants (β):** The overall stability constants (`βn`) describe the formation of each complex from the free metal ion and ligands:\n    *   `Co^2+ + SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)]^+` ; `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]^+] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 2SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)2]` ; `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) = 40`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 3SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)3]^-` ; `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3) = 63`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 4SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)4]^2-` ; `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4) = 16`\n\n3.  **Express the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`:** The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of the concentrations of the free `Co^2+` ion and all the complexes it forms.\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n4.  **Express complex concentrations in terms of `[Co^2+]`:** Using the stability constant definitions, we can write the concentration of each complex as a function of `[Co^2+]` and `[SCN^-]`:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\n5.  **Derive the formula for the mole fraction (`α`)**: The mole fraction of a particular species is its concentration divided by the total concentration of cobalt. We are interested in the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]`, which we'll call `α2`.\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    By substituting the expressions from step 4 into the equation for `c(Co)` from step 3 and factoring out `[Co^2+]`, we get:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n    Now, substitute this and the expression for `[[Co(SCN)2]]` into the formula for `α2`:\n    `α2 = (β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+](1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` terms cancel out, leaving a formula that depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN^-]` and the stability constants:\n    `α2 = (β2[SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n6.  **Apply the given values and assumptions:**\n    *   `β1=9`, `β2=40`, `β3=63`, `β4=16`.\n    *   `[SCN^-] = 0.1 M`. Since the thiocyanate concentration (`0.1 M`) is ten times the total cobalt concentration (`0.01 M`), we can approximate the free equilibrium concentration `[SCN^-]` to be the same as the initial total concentration, `0.1 M`. This is a common simplification in such problems when the ligand is in large excess.\n\n7.  **Calculate the value of `α2`:** Let's calculate the terms in the expression.\n    *   Denominator sum (let's call it D):\n        *   Term 0: `1`\n        *   Term 1: `β1 * [SCN^-]^1 = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n        *   Term 2: `β2 * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n        *   Term 3: `β3 * [SCN^-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n        *   Term 4: `β4 * [SCN^-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n        *   `D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    *   Numerator (which is Term 2): `0.4`\n\n    *   `α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n8.  **Convert to percentage:** The percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex is `α2 * 100%`.\n    `Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can perform the calculation using a short Python script.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the problem\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_concentration = 0.1\n\n# The numerator for the mole fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_concentration**2)\n\n# The denominator, which is the sum of terms for all species\ndenominator = 1 + \\\n              beta1 * (scn_concentration**1) + \\\n              beta2 * (scn_concentration**2) + \\\n              beta3 * (scn_concentration**3) + \\\n              beta4 * (scn_concentration**4)\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the mole fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n\nThe computed value of approximately 16.9% matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)2]`, among all cobalt-containing species is calculated using the concept of mole fractions in complexation equilibria.\n\n1.  **Total Cobalt:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free `Co^2+` ion and all its thiocyanate complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]^- + [Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\n2.  **Mole Fraction (α):** The percentage of a specific species is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. We want to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)2]`, so we need to calculate its mole fraction, `α2`.\n\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n3.  **Formula for Mole Fraction:** Using the overall stability constants (β), the mole fraction of the `n`-th complex, `[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)`, can be expressed as:\n\n    `αn = (βn * [SCN-]^n) / (1 + β1*[SCN-]^1 + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)`\n\n    In our case, we need `α2`.\n\n4.  **Given Data:**\n    *   Concentration of `[SCN-]` = 0.1 M (We can use this as the equilibrium concentration because the ligand is in large excess compared to the metal ion, 0.1 M vs. 0.01 M).\n    *   β1 = 9\n    *   β2 = 40 (This corresponds to the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex)\n    *   β3 = 63\n    *   β4 = 16\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    We need to calculate the value of the numerator and the denominator of the `α2` formula.\n\n    *   **Numerator:** `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   **Denominator:**\n        *   1 (for free `Co^2+`)\n        *   `β1 * [SCN-]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n        *   `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n        *   `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n        *   `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n        *   **Sum of Denominator:** `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    *   **Mole Fraction `α2`:** `α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n6.  **Convert to Percentage:**\n    `Percentage = α2 * 100 = 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
