    "An optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A compound is achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry, a center of inversion, or any improper axis of rotation. We will analyze each compound to determine its chirality.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   The double bond and the atoms attached to it lie in a plane. The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name describes a complex bicyclic structure, similar to a substituted norbornane derivative.\n    *   The core structure `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione` (equivalent to bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride) is achiral (meso) as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` (which likely means a `=CHCl` group on the C7 bridge, designated C8 in this nomenclature system) is asymmetric.\n    *   This asymmetric substituent destroys the plane of symmetry of the parent molecule.\n    *   The designation `(3aR,7aS,E)` specifies a single, non-meso stereoisomer. The molecule lacks any element of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a meso compound. This can be seen by drawing a conformation that possesses a center of inversion.\n    *   A meso compound is **achiral** despite having chiral centers. It is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` isomers form an enantiomeric pair. They are chiral and do not have any internal symmetry elements.\n    *   Since a single enantiomer `(2R,3R)` is specified, it is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   This molecule has a chiral center at C1, which is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH=CH-, and -CH2-CH2-.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This nomenclature specifies the stereoisomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry (σv). Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   A careful check of all carbon atoms reveals that there are no chiral centers in this molecule.\n    *   Furthermore, it is possible to find a conformation of the molecule that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would contain the `C(=O)-CH2-CH` portion of the chain and would bisect the two methyl groups and the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Since the molecule has no chiral centers and possesses a plane of symmetry in an accessible conformation, it is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it will exhibit optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. The double bond and the atoms directly attached to it lie in a single plane. The entire molecule is planar. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which makes it **achiral** and thus optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name specifies a single, well-defined stereoisomer using `(3aR,7aS,E)` notation. Molecules of this complexity with specific R/S configurations are almost always chiral unless there is an unusual element of symmetry. This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, it is **chiral** and, as a single stereoisomer, it is optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). However, the stereochemistry is `(2R,3S)`, meaning the two centers have opposite configurations. This configuration results in a *meso* compound. A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry (in an eclipsed conformation) or a center of inversion (in a staggered conformation), making it **achiral** despite the presence of stereocenters. Achiral compounds are optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The stereochemistry is `(2R,3R)`, meaning both stereocenters have the same configuration. This stereoisomer is **chiral** and lacks any internal symmetry elements. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, which is non-superimposable. Since a single enantiomer `(2R,3R)` is given, it is optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This molecule has a stereocenter at the C1 carbon atom, which is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, the alkenyl group `-CH=CH-`, and the alkyl group `-CH2-CH2-`. A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. Thus, it is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This nomenclature refers to the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). Whether in the all-axial or all-equatorial chair conformation, this molecule possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) and three planes of symmetry (σᵥ). The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. A survey of the molecule reveals no stereocenters. Furthermore, the molecule can adopt a conformation with a plane of symmetry that contains the carbonyl group, the CH₂, and the methine `CH`, and bisects the isopropyl's two methyl groups and the cyclopentyl ring. Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following compounds are chiral and will exhibit optical activity as specified single stereoisomers:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds in the list.\n\n(*Note: The provided code output suggested there were 5 optically active compounds. This output is incorrect due to potential misinterpretations by the software for the highly symmetric or flexible molecules. Specifically, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a classic textbook example of an achiral meso compound, and (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is also achiral due to its high symmetry. The chemical principles are clear in these cases.*)\n\nThe correct number of optically active compounds is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
