    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product, we need to follow these steps:\n1.  **Determine the structure of the reactant.**\n    The reactant is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\".\n    *   **Parent structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene` implies a six-membered ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and 4.\n    *   **Principal functional group:** `carboxylic acid` (-COOH) is at position 1.\n    *   **Substituents:**\n        *   `2-formyl`: an aldehyde group (-CHO) is on carbon 2.\n        *   `5-vinyl`: a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is on carbon 5.\n\n2.  **Determine the molecular formula of the reactant.**\n    Let's count the atoms based on the structure:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH₂ = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** We can deduce this, but it's not strictly necessary for the next step. Let's do it for completeness. C1(1H), C2(1H), C3(1H), C4(1H), C5(1H), C6(2H) in the ring structure. 1H in -COOH, 1H in -CHO, 3H in -CH=CH₂. Total H = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n    *   The molecular formula of the reactant is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n3.  **Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n    The reagent is red phosphorus and excess hydriodic acid (Red P + HI). This is a powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds) to the corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The vinyl group's double bond (-CH=CH₂) is reduced to a single bond, forming an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring (C=C) is reduced to a single bond (C-C).\n    *   The six-membered ring itself remains intact.\n\n    The product is a saturated hydrocarbon with the same carbon skeleton as the reactant. The product will be a cyclohexane ring substituted with:\n    *   A methyl group at position 1.\n    *   A methyl group at position 2.\n    *   An ethyl group at position 5.\n    The final product is a trisubstituted cyclohexane. The specific IUPAC name would be 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, but what matters is its composition.\n\n4.  **Determine the molecular formula of the product.**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** The number of carbon atoms does not change. C = 10.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane). The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. For n=10, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n    *   All oxygen atoms are removed.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) for a hydrocarbon with formula CₐHₙ is calculated using the formula:\n    IHD = (2a + 2 - b) / 2\n    Alternatively, a simpler formula is IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where X are halogens and N is nitrogen. For a hydrocarbon CₐHₙ:\n    IHD = a + 1 - b/2\n    Let's calculate the IHD for our product, C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nI will use a short Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Number of carbon atoms in the product\nC = 10\n# Number of hydrogen atoms in the product\nH = 20\n\n# Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n# IHD = C + 1 - (H / 2)\nihd = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n\nprint(int(ihd))\n```\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) can also be understood by looking at the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Each ring contributes 1 to the IHD. Therefore, the IHD of the product is 1.\n\nThe calculation confirms this:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nFinal answer is 1. Comparing this to the options:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 3\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The starting material is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\". Let's break down its structure:\n    *   **Core Structure:** A six-membered ring (`cyclohex...ene`). It has a double bond (`...-3-ene...`) between carbons 3 and 4.\n    *   **Functional Groups and Substituents:**\n        *   A carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at position 1.\n        *   A formyl group (`-CHO`, an aldehyde) at position 2.\n        *   A vinyl group (`-CH=CH₂`) at position 5.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of Reactant:**\n        *   Carbon (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH₂ = 10 carbons.\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n        *   Hydrogen (H): Counting hydrogens on the structure gives H₁₂. (This is not strictly necessary for the final calculation but helps in understanding the reactant).\n        *   The molecular formula of the reactant is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (Red P + HI). This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent known for performing complete or exhaustive reduction.\n    *   It reduces carbonyl-containing functional groups (aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids) down to the corresponding alkyl groups.\n        *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds.\n        *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be hydrogenated to a single bond.\n        *   The double bond in the vinyl group will be hydrogenated, converting the vinyl group into an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   Essentially, all forms of unsaturation (double bonds) and all oxygen atoms are removed, and the molecule is converted into the corresponding saturated hydrocarbon, while retaining the original carbon skeleton.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure and Formula:**\n    *   The carbon skeleton consists of a 6-membered ring with two single-carbon substituents and one two-carbon substituent.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms remains 10.\n    *   Since all double bonds are reduced and all oxygen atoms are removed, the product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n    *   The product is a saturated cycloalkane containing 10 carbon atoms.\n    *   The general formula for a monocyclic saturated alkane (a cycloalkane) is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   For our product, n = 10. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It is calculated by comparing the number of hydrogens in the molecule to the number in the corresponding acyclic saturated alkane (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂).\n\n    The formula for IHD of a hydrocarbon CₐHₙ is:\n    IHD = (2a + 2 - b) / 2\n\n    For our product with the formula **C₁₀H₂₀**:\n    *   a = 10 (number of carbon atoms)\n    *   b = 20 (number of hydrogen atoms)\n    *   IHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\n    *   IHD = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2\n    *   IHD = 2 / 2\n    *   IHD = 1\n\n    Alternatively, the IHD can be determined from the structure. The final product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of double bonds = 0\n    *   Number of triple bonds = 0\n    *   IHD = (number of rings) + (number of double bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n    Both methods yield an IHD of 1.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
