    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons (Integration)**\n\n*   The 1H NMR spectrum shows four signals with integrations of 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\n*   The total number of protons in the molecule is the sum of the integrations: 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\n### **2. Compare Proton Count with Candidate Molecules**\n\n*   Let's determine the number of protons in each of the four possible compounds.\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** CH₃COOCH=CHCH₃\n        *   Acetate methyl (CH₃-COO): 3H\n        *   Vinylic protons (-CH=CH-): 1H + 1H\n        *   Propenyl methyl (-CH₃): 3H\n        *   **Total = 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8H**. This matches the NMR data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** CH₃COOCH=CHCH₂CH₃\n        *   Acetate methyl (CH₃-COO): 3H\n        *   Vinylic protons (-CH=CH-): 1H + 1H\n        *   Methylene protons (-CH₂-): 2H\n        *   Terminal methyl (-CH₃): 3H\n        *   **Total = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 10H**. This does not match the NMR data.\n\n*   Since the total proton count is 8, we can confidently eliminate both **Cis-butenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**. The unknown compound must be either **Cis-propenyl acetate** or **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n### **3. Assign Individual 1H NMR Signals**\n\nLet's analyze each signal for the propenyl acetate structure: CH₃(a)-C(=O)-O-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d)\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   This is a singlet (s), meaning it has no adjacent protons.\n    *   The integration is 3H, corresponding to a methyl group.\n    *   A chemical shift around 2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group in an acetate ester (protons 'a').\n    *   **Assignment:** CH₃-C=O\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   This is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton.\n    *   The integration is 3H, corresponding to a methyl group.\n    *   The chemical shift around 1.6 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to a double bond. This must be the terminal methyl group of the propenyl chain (protons 'd'). It is split by the adjacent vinylic proton (H'c').\n    *   **Assignment:** =CH-CH₃\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   This signal for one proton (1H) is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three protons (giving the quartet).\n    *   This perfectly describes the vinylic proton H'c' (=CH-CH₃). It is split by the other vinylic proton H'b' (doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group 'd' (quartet).\n    *   **Assignment:** -O-CH=**CH**-CH₃\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   This signal for one proton (1H) is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to only one adjacent proton. The coupling constant is given as J = 16.0 Hz.\n    *   This corresponds to the vinylic proton H'b' (-O-CH=). It is highly deshielded (downfield shift to 7.0 ppm) due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent ester oxygen atom. It is split into a doublet by the other vinylic proton, H'c'.\n    *   **Assignment:** -O-**CH**=CH-CH₃\n\n### **4. Determine Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans) using the Coupling Constant (J)**\n\n*   The key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers lies in the coupling constant (³J_HH) between the two vinylic protons (H'b' and H'c').\n*   The problem states that the signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with **J = 16.0 Hz**. This is the coupling constant between the two vinylic protons.\n*   The established rules for vinylic proton coupling are:\n    *   **J_trans:** Typically ranges from 12 Hz to 18 Hz.\n    *   **J_cis:** Typically ranges from 6 Hz to 12 Hz.\n*   The observed value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration. This indicates that the two vinylic protons are on opposite sides of the double bond.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the proton count, the assignment of all signals, and particularly the large vinylic coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
