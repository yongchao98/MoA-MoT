    "*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    1.  The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n    2.  There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak) with an intensity of about 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%).\n    3.  This M+ to M+2 intensity ratio of approximately 3:1 is a hallmark isotopic signature for a compound containing a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes have a natural abundance ratio of roughly 75:25, or 3:1).\n    4.  We can calculate the molecular formula for the proposed structures. All options (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, Phenyl chloroformate, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, and 4-chlorobenzoic acid) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The mass for the ³⁵Cl isotope is: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + 35 + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. The mass for the ³⁷Cl isotope is 158 g/mol. This is consistent with the MS data. Therefore, the MS data confirms the molecular formula and the presence of one chlorine atom but cannot distinguish between the isomers.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    1.  A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is observed. This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded in a dimeric form. The broadness is a key indicator.\n    2.  A strong, sharp peak is seen at 1720 cm⁻¹. This frequency is typical for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch of a carboxylic acid, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    3.  Together, these two peaks strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This evidence allows us to eliminate option A (an aldehyde/alcohol) and option B (a chloroformate ester), leaving C and D as possibilities.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    1.  **Signal at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The signal being a singlet (s) and integrating to one proton (1H) confirms this assignment. This further supports that the unknown is a carboxylic acid.\n    2.  **Signals at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The key information here is the splitting pattern and integration. We see two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H). This symmetrical pattern is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    3.  Let's compare the remaining options:\n        *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) benzene ring. It would have 4 non-equivalent aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n        *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. Due to symmetry, the two protons ortho to the carboxylic acid group are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom are equivalent. This leads to two distinct signals. The protons ortho to the carboxylic acid are split by their neighbors, resulting in a doublet. The protons ortho to the chlorine are also split by their neighbors, resulting in another doublet. This perfectly matches the observed NMR data of two doublets, each integrating to two protons. The downfield signal (8.02 ppm) corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal (7.72 ppm) corresponds to the protons ortho to the chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular weight and presence of chlorine. The IR and the 11 ppm NMR signal confirm the carboxylic acid functional group. The aromatic region of the NMR confirms the 1,4-disubstitution pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
