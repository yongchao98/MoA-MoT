    "To solve this problem, we need to find the energy eigenvalues for a particle in the given two-dimensional potential. The potential is provided in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nThe form of the potential suggests that it might be simpler to work in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). Let's perform the coordinate transformation using the standard relations:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nSubstitute these into the potential expression:\nFirst, note that the term `r cos(θ)` is simply `x`. So, `r^2 cos^2(θ) = x^2`.\nThe term `r^2` is `x^2 + y^2`.\nSubstituting these into the potential V gives:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\n\nNow, we group the terms containing x and y:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis is the potential of a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential is separable, meaning it's a sum of two independent potentials, one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\nV_x(x) = 2kx^2\nV_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\nFor such a separable potential, the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators:\nE = E_x + E_y\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(z) = 1/2 mω^2 z^2 are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n1.  **Energy for the x-direction (E_x):**\n    The potential is V_x(x) = 2kx^2. We can write this in the standard form V_x(x) = 1/2 mω_x^2 x^2.\n    Comparing the two forms, we have:\n    1/2 mω_x^2 = 2k\n    ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n    ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\n    E_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n\n2.  **Energy for the y-direction (E_y):**\n    The potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2. This can be written as V_y(y) = 1/2 mω_y^2 y^2.\n    Comparing the two forms:\n    1/2 mω_y^2 = 1/2 k\n    ω_y^2 = k/m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\n    E_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n3.  **Total Energy (E):**\n    The total energy is the sum E = E_x + E_y:\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n    We can factor out the term ℏ*sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    Now, distribute the constants inside the brackets:\n    E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    Combine the constant terms:\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe integers n_x and n_y are the quantum numbers for the respective dimensions, and they can take values 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nOur calculated energy spectrum E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m) perfectly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
