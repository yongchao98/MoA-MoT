    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data:**\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the range of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O in a carboxylic acid is typically found around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to a C=C (alkene) stretch.\n\n*Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data:**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene, which was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly characteristic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. (Mass = 12 for C + 16*2 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Information:**\nThe combined spectral data strongly indicates that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the molecule must contain:\n*   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which contains two oxygen atoms and one C=O double bond.\n*   An alkene group (C=C), which contains one C=C double bond.\n\n**5. Calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C - H/2 + 1` (for a formula containing only C, H, and O).\nBased on our analysis, the molecule must have at least one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n*   1 DoU from the C=O bond.\n*   1 DoU from the C=C bond.\nTherefore, the total DoU of the molecule must be at least 2.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given options:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(C, H):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation.\"\"\"\n    return C - (H / 2) + 1\n\n# Formulas from the options\noptions = {\n    'A': {'formula': 'C6H10O2', 'C': 6, 'H': 10, 'O': 2},\n    'B': {'formula': 'C6H10O', 'C': 6, 'H': 10, 'O': 1},\n    'C': {'formula': 'C6H12O', 'C': 6, 'H': 12, 'O': 1},\n    'D': {'formula': 'C6H12O2', 'C': 6, 'H': 12, 'O': 2}\n}\n\nprint(\"Requirement: DoU >= 2 and Oxygen count = 2\")\nprint(\"-\" * 45)\nprint(f\"{'Option':<10} {'Formula':<10} {'DoU':<5} {'Oxygens':<10} {'Fits?':<5}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 45)\n\nfor key, val in options.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(val['C'], val['H'])\n    oxygens = val['O']\n    fits = 'Yes' if (dou >= 2 and oxygens == 2) else 'No'\n    print(f\"{key:<10} {val['formula']:<10} {int(dou):<5} {oxygens:<10} {fits:<5}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 45)\n```\n<execute_code>\nRequirement: DoU >= 2 and Oxygen count = 2\n---------------------------------------------\nOption     Formula    DoU   Oxygens    Fits?\n---------------------------------------------\nA          C6H10O2    2     2          Yes  \nB          C6H10O     2     1          No   \nC          C6H12O     1     1          No   \nD          C6H12O2    1     2          No   \n---------------------------------------------\n</execute_code>\n**6. Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** Has a DoU of 2 and contains two oxygen atoms. This is perfectly consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid structure.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O:** Has the correct DoU of 2 but only one oxygen. It cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:** Has a DoU of 1 and only one oxygen. This is inconsistent with the evidence.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:** Contains two oxygen atoms but has a DoU of only 1. This means it could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it cannot also contain the required alkene group.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Based on the detailed analysis:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectroscopy**: The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, combined with a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, is characteristic of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), meaning the molecule is unsaturated.\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy**: The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of the C=C double bond suggested by the FTIR data.\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry**: The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic fingerprint for the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺), further confirming the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from Data Synthesis**:\nThe compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This means:\n*   It must contain **two oxygen atoms** (from the -COOH group). This eliminates options B (C₆H₁₀O) and C (C₆H₁₂O).\n*   It must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation**: one for the carbonyl (C=O) in the acid and one for the alkene (C=C).\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options based on the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU = C - H/2 + 1):\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This is consistent with one C=O and one C=C.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This molecule only has one degree of unsaturation, which would be used by the carboxylic acid's C=O. It cannot also contain an alkene C=C bond.\n\nThe code output correctly identified that only **C₆H₁₀O₂** (Option A) has both two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2, satisfying all the experimental evidence.\n\n<<<A>>>"
