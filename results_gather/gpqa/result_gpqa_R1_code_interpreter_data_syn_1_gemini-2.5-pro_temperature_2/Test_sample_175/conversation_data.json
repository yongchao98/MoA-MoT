    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given:\n*   An initial quantum state `|ψ⟩`.\n*   Two operators for observables, `P` and `Q`.\n*   A sequence of measurements: first `P`, then `Q`.\n\nWe need to find the probability of getting a specific outcome for `P` (which is `p=0`) and then a specific outcome for `Q` (which is `q=-1`).\n\nThe probability of a sequence of measurements `A` then `B` is calculated as follows:\n`Prob(B=b, A=a) = Prob(A=a) * Prob(B=b | after measuring A=a)`\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n**Step 1: Define the initial state and operators and normalize the state.**\n\n*   Initial state vector (unnormalized): `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n*   The norm squared is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n*   The normalized state is `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n*   Operator `P`:\n    ```\n    | 0    1/√2   0    |\n    | 1/√2   0    1/√2  |\n    | 0    1/√2   0    |\n    ```\n*   Operator `Q`:\n    ```\n    | 1   0   0  |\n    | 0   0   0  |\n    | 0   0  -1  |\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the probability of measuring P=0.**\n\nFirst, we need the eigenvector of `P` corresponding to the eigenvalue `p=0`.\n*   Solve `P|v⟩ = 0 * |v⟩` which simplifies to `P|v⟩ = 0`.\n    ```\n    | 0    1/√2   0    | |x|   |0|\n    | 1/√2   0    1/√2  | |y| = |0|\n    | 0    1/√2   0    | |z|   |0|\n    ```\n*   From the first row, `(1/√2)y = 0`, which means `y=0`.\n*   From the second row, `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0`, which means `x = -z`.\n*   So, the eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. Let's choose `x=1` to get `[1, 0, -1]^T`.\n*   Normalize this eigenvector: The norm is `√ (1² + 0² + (-1)²) = √2`.\n*   The normalized eigenvector for `p=0` is `|v_p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\nNow, the probability `Prob(p=0)` is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto this eigenvector: `Prob(p=0) = |⟨v_p=0|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n*   `⟨v_p=0|ψ_norm⟩ = [ (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ] . [ (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T ]`\n*   `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`.\n*   `Prob(p=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`.\n\n**Step 3: State collapse after the first measurement.**\n\nAfter measuring `P` and obtaining the value `0`, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|v_p=0⟩`.\n*   The new state of the system is `|ψ'⟩ = |v_p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1 in the new state.**\n\nFirst, we need the eigenvector of `Q` corresponding to the eigenvalue `q=-1`.\n*   The operator `Q` is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (`1, 0, -1`) and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n*   The eigenvector for `q=-1` is `|v_q=-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T`. (This is already normalized).\n\nNow, the probability `Prob(q=-1)` is calculated using the collapsed state `|ψ'⟩`: `Prob(q=-1) = |⟨v_q=-1|ψ'⟩|²`.\n*   `⟨v_q=-1|ψ'⟩ = [ [0, 0, 1] ] . [ (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T ]`\n*   `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`.\n*   `Prob(q=-1 | after p=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total probability.**\n\nThe combined probability of the sequence of events is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the steps above.\n*   `Total Probability = Prob(p=0) * Prob(q=-1 | after p=0)`\n*   `Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\nTo verify this, we can use a numerical computation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the initial state (as a column vector) and operators\npsi = np.array([[-1], [2], [1]])\nP = np.array([[0, 1/np.sqrt(2), 0],\n              [1/np.sqrt(2), 0, 1/np.sqrt(2)],\n              [0, 1/np.sqrt(2), 0]])\nQ = np.array([[1, 0, 0],\n              [0, 0, 0],\n              [0, 0, -1]])\n\n# --- Method using projection operators ---\n# The probability is given by || Proj_q(-1) Proj_p(0) |psi> ||^2 / || <psi|psi> ||\n# Where Proj_x(lambda) is the projection operator onto the eigenspace of X for eigenvalue lambda.\n\n# 1.

    "The problem asks for the probability of a sequence of two quantum measurements. First, the observable `P` is measured, yielding the result 0. Immediately after, the observable `Q` is measured, yielding the result -1.\n\nThe probability of such a sequence of events `(P=p, Q=q)` can be calculated using the formula:\n`Prob(P=p, Q=q) = Prob(P=p) × Prob(Q=q | after P was measured and gave p)`\n\nLet's break down the calculation into steps.\n\n**1. Define the Initial State and Operators**\n\n*   Initial state (unnormalized): `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n*   Operator `P`:\n    ```\n    [[ 0,    1/√2,   0   ],\n     [ 1/√2,   0,    1/√2 ],\n     [ 0,    1/√2,   0   ]]\n    ```\n*   Operator `Q`:\n    ```\n    [[ 1, 0,  0 ],\n     [ 0, 0,  0 ],\n     [ 0, 0, -1 ]]\n    ```\n\n**2. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nFirst, we need to work with a normalized state vector. The squared norm of the initial state is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalization factor is `1/√6`. So the normalized initial state `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of Measuring P = 0**\n\nTo do this, we first need to find the eigenvector of `P` corresponding to the eigenvalue `p=0`.\nLet the eigenvector be `|v⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`. The eigenvalue equation is `P|v⟩ = 0 * |v⟩ = 0`.\n```\n[[ 0,    1/√2,   0   ],   [[x],   [[0],\n [ 1/√2,   0,    1/√2 ], .  [y], =  [0],\n [ 0,    1/√2,   0   ]]    [z]]    [0]]\n```\nThis gives us a system of linear equations:\n*   From row 1: `(1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0`\n*   From row 2: `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  => x = -z`\n\nSo, any eigenvector for `p=0` is of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. Let's choose `x=1` to get a simple representative vector: `[1, 0, -1]^T`.\nNow we normalize this eigenvector, let's call it `|v_p=0⟩`.\n*   Norm squared: `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`.\n*   Normalized eigenvector: `|v_p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\nThe probability of measuring `p=0` is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state `|ψ_norm⟩` onto this eigenvector `|v_p=0⟩`:\n`Prob(P=0) = |⟨v_p=0 | ψ_norm⟩|²`\n*   `⟨v_p=0 | ψ_norm⟩ = [ (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ] . [ (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T ]`\n*   `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n*   `= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n*   `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n**4. State Collapse and Second Measurement**\n\nAfter measuring `P=0`, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|v_p=0⟩`. The new state of the system `|ψ'⟩` is:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |v_p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\nNow, we calculate the probability of measuring `Q = -1` in this new state `|ψ'⟩`. First, we find the eigenvector of `Q` for the eigenvalue `q=-1`.\n*   `Q` is a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are its diagonal elements (`1, 0, -1`), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n*   The eigenvector for `q=-1` is `|v_q=-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T`, which is already normalized.\n\nThe probability of measuring `Q = -1` is the squared magnitude of the projection of the new state `|ψ'⟩` onto `|v_q=-1⟩`:\n`Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨v_q=-1 | ψ'⟩|²`\n*   `⟨v_q=-1 | ψ'⟩ = [ [0, 0, 1] ] . [ (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T ]`\n*   `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`\n*   `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Probability**\n\nFinally, we multiply the probabilities of the two steps to get the total probability of the sequence.\n*   `Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`\n*   `Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThe python code output `0.166666...` confirms this result.\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<B>>>"
