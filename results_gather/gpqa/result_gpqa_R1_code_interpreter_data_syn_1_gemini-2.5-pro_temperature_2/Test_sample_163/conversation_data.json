    "To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses, `M_system1 / M_system2`.\n\n### **1. Key Concepts and Formulas**\n\nThe total mass of a spectroscopic, eclipsing binary system can be derived from Kepler's Third Law. For a system with stars of mass `m1` and `m2`, orbital period `P`, and radial velocity amplitudes `K1` and `K2`, the total mass `M_total = m1 + m2` is given by:\n\n`M_total = (P / (2 * π * G)) * ( (K1 + K2) / sin(i) )^3`\n\nwhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are **eclipsing**. This implies that the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination `i` is very close to 90 degrees. Therefore, `sin(i)` is very close to 1, and we can make the approximation `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n\nThe problem also mentions **sinusoidal variations** of radial velocities, which is characteristic of circular orbits. Therefore, the formula is applicable without modification for eccentricity.\n\nWith `sin(i) ≈ 1`, the formula for the total mass simplifies to:\n\n`M_total ≈ (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G)`\n\nThis shows that the total mass is proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n\n`M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3`\n\n### **2. Calculating the Ratio of Masses**\n\nWe can find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (`M1`) to the mass of system_2 (`M2`) using the proportionality:\n\n`M1 / M2 = [ P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3 ] / [ P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3 ]`\n\n### **3. Plugging in the Values**\n\nLet's use the data provided in the problem:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period `P1` = 2 years\n*   Velocity amplitudes `K1a` = 10 km/s and `K1b` = 5 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities `(K1a + K1b)` = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period `P2` = 1 year\n*   Velocity amplitudes `K2a` = 15 km/s and `K2b` = 10 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities `(K2a + K2b)` = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow, substitute these values into the ratio formula. Note that since we are calculating a ratio, we can use the periods in years and velocities in km/s directly, as the units will cancel out.\n\n`M1 / M2 = [ 2 * (15)^3 ] / [ 1 * (25)^3 ]`\n`M1 / M2 = (2 * 15 * 15 * 15) / (25 * 25 * 25)`\n`M1 / M2 = (2 * 3375) / 15625`\n`M1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625`\n\n### **4. Computation**\n\nTo get the final decimal value, we can perform the division. A simple python script can compute this accurately.\n\n```python\n# Data for system_1\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_sum = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\n# Data for system_2\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_sum = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the ratio M1 / M2\n# M_ratio is proportional to (P * K_sum^3)\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K1_sum**3)) / (P2 * (K2_sum**3))\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.432\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated ratio is `0.432`.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe mass of system_1 is `0.432` times the mass of system_2. Comparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) ~ 0.4\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe value `0.432` is approximately `0.4`.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The total mass `M_total` of an eclipsing binary system is proportional to the orbital period `P` and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (`K1` + `K2`). The formula derived from Kepler's Third Law for a circular orbit is:\n\n`M_total = (P / (2 * π * G)) * ( (K1 + K2) / sin(i) )^3`\n\nSince both systems are eclipsing, we can assume the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, making `sin(i)` ≈ 1. All other constants (`G`, `2π`) will cancel out when we take the ratio of the two masses.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the masses is:\n\n`Mass_ratio = M_system1 / M_system2 ∝ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3)`\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   `P1` = 2 years\n*   `K1a` = 10 km/s\n*   `K1b` = 5 km/s\n*   `K1a + K1b` = 15 km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   `P2` = 1 year\n*   `K2a` = 15 km/s\n*   `K2b` = 10 km/s\n*   `K2a + K2b` = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio:\n\n`Mass_ratio = (2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3)`\n`Mass_ratio = (2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625)`\n`Mass_ratio = 6750 / 15625`\n`Mass_ratio = 0.432`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
