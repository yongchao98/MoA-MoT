    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the reaction conditions.**\n    *   Compound X has a molecular formula of C11H12O.\n    *   It is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), which is a non-nucleophilic, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is carried out in a nonpolar solvent at a high temperature (403 K = 130 °C).\n    *   These conditions (base, heat) are typical for isomerization or elimination reactions. Since the molecular formula of the product is expected to be the same as the reactant (C11H12O), an isomerization reaction is the most likely process.\n    *   The options provided for Compound X are all epoxides (oxiranes), suggesting the reaction is an epoxide isomerization.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the NMR spectra of the product to determine its structure.**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** The product of an isomerization will have the same molecular formula as the starting material, C11H12O. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU): DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6. This indicates the presence of rings and/or pi bonds. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n\n    *   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n        *   The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is highly characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically in a **ketone** or aldehyde.\n        *   The signals at **δ 21.3 ppm** and **δ 28.4 ppm** are in the alkyl region, corresponding to two different methyl (CH3) carbons.\n        *   The remaining six signals are in the range of δ 126.9-144.1 ppm, typical for sp2 hybridized carbons found in aromatic rings and alkenes.\n        *   The total carbon count from the spectrum is 1 (ketone) + 2 (methyls) + 6 (sp2) = 9 signals, but the integrations show (2C) and (2C), for a total of 1+1+2+1+2+1+1+1+1 = 11 carbons, matching the molecular formula.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)**: These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This indicates two methyl groups that are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n        *   **Aromatic/Vinyl Region**: The signals from δ 6.75 to δ 7.71 are complex.\n            *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**: This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n            *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**: This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton, indicates two protons on a double bond that are coupled to each other (a `-CH=CH-` group).\n\n    *   **Putting the pieces together for the product structure:**\n        1.  We have a ketone (`C=O`).\n        2.  We have two methyl groups (`-CH3`) that are singlets. One can be the methyl group of a methyl ketone (`-C(=O)CH3`). The other must be attached to a quaternary carbon, likely the aromatic ring.\n        3.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. One substituent is the methyl group (forming a `p-tolyl` group).\n        4.  We have a `-CH=CH-` group.\n        5.  Let's assemble these fragments: a `p-tolyl` group (`p-CH3-C6H4-`), a `-CH=CH-` group, and a methyl ketone fragment (`-C(=O)CH3`).\n        6.  The only logical assembly is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n            *   Structure: `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`\n        7.  Let's verify this structure against the NMR data:\n            *   `p-CH3-`: One methyl singlet (e.g., δ 2.31).\n            *   `-C(=O)CH3`: A second methyl singlet (e.g., δ 2.28).\n            *   `p-CH3-C6H4-`: The four aromatic protons will appear as two doublets (2H each). This matches δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d).\n            *   `-CH=CH-`: The two vinyl protons will appear as two doublets (1H each). This matches δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d).\n            *   The molecular formula of this structure is C11H12O. (C7H7 from tolyl + C4H5O from butenone fragment = C11H12O).\n            *   This structure fits all the NMR data perfectly.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify Compound X.**\n    *   The reaction is an isomerization of Compound X to form 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Therefore, Compound X must be an isomer of the product and have the same molecular formula (C11H12O) and the same fundamental carbon skeleton.\n    *   The product contains a **p-tolyl group** (`p-CH3-C6H4-`). Since the reaction is a simple isomerization under basic conditions, it is extremely unlikely that a methyl group would migrate onto a phenyl ring. Thus, the starting material, Compound X, must also contain a p-tolyl group.\n    *   Let's examine the options for Compound X:\n        *   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**: Contains a styryl group (`C6H5-CH=CH-`), which has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Incorrect.\n        *   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**: The 4-methylstyryl group is `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-`. This compound **contains a p-tolyl group**. The molecular formula is `(C9H9)`-`C2H3O` = C11H12O. This matches. The structure is `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`. This is an isomer of the product.\n        *   **C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**: Contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Incorrect.\n        *   **D) 2-styrylepoxide**: Ambiguous name, but \"styryl\" implies a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. The likely molecular formula also does not match. Incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the definitive structure of the product deduced from the NMR data, the starting material must contain a p-tolyl group and be an isomer of the product. Only option B, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, meets these criteria. The reaction is an isomerization of a terminal vinyloxirane to an α,β-unsaturated methyl ketone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
