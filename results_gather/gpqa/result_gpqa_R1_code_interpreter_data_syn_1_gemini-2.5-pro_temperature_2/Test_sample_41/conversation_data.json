    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to determine the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to Planet1 (P3 / P1).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics Principles:** We need to relate the orbital period (P) of a planet to its equilibrium temperature (T_eq). This involves two key physical laws: the Stefan-Boltzmann law for thermal equilibrium and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n3.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) to Orbital Distance (a):**\n    *   The equilibrium temperature of a planet is achieved when the energy absorbed from its star equals the energy it radiates into space.\n    *   The energy absorbed is proportional to 1/a², where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit (or the orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n    *   The energy radiated is proportional to T_eq⁴ (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law).\n    *   Therefore, T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a².\n    *   Taking the fourth root of both sides gives T_eq ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4) = 1/a^(1/2).\n    *   This means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance: `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`.\n    *   We can also write this as `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n    *   This relationship holds because the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, as stated in the problem. The specific value of the albedo (0.3) is not needed, only that it is constant for all planets.\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Period (P) to Orbital Distance (a):**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis: `P² ∝ a³`.\n    *   This can be rewritten as `P ∝ a^(3/2)`.\n    *   This law applies to all planets orbiting the same star. The masses of the planets are considered negligible compared to the star's mass, which is a standard and valid assumption. Therefore, the provided mass ratios are extraneous information.\n\n5.  **Combine the Relationships to Link Period (P) and Temperature (T_eq):**\n    *   We have `P ∝ a^(3/2)` and `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n    *   Substitute the expression for 'a' from the temperature relation into the period relation:\n        `P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2)`\n        `P ∝ 1/T_eq³`\n    *   This shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Ratio:**\n    *   Based on the relationship `P ∝ 1/T_eq³`, the ratio of the periods of Planet3 and Planet1 is:\n        `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Required Temperature Ratio (T_eq1 / T_eq3):**\n    *   The problem gives us the following ratios:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4`\n        `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`\n    *   To find `T_eq1 / T_eq3`, we can multiply these two ratios:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3`\n\n8.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`.\n    *   Now, substitute this value into the period ratio formula:\n        `P3 / P1 = (3.22)³`\n    *   To get the precise numerical value, we can use a simple calculation.\n\nI will use the following Python code to perform the calculation accurately.\n```python\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\nt1_t2_ratio = 1.4\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3.\nt2_t3_ratio = 2.3\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 to Planet3 is the product of the two given ratios.\n# (T1/T2) * (T2/T3) = T1/T3\nt1_t3_ratio = t1_t2_ratio * t2_t3_ratio\n\n# The relationship between orbital period (P) and equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is P ∝ 1/(T_eq^3).\n# Therefore, the ratio of the periods P3/P1 is equal to (T_eq1/T_eq3)^3.\np3_p1_ratio = t1_t3_ratio**3\n\n# Print the final result, which is the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.\nprint(p3_p1_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n33.386248\n</execute_code>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 33.386. Rounding this to one decimal place gives 33.4.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We need to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (P₃ / P₁).\n\n2.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) to Orbital Distance (a):**\n    *   The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away.\n    *   The power absorbed from the star is proportional to `1/a²`, where 'a' is the orbital distance from the star.\n    *   The power radiated by the planet is proportional to `T_eq⁴` (according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law).\n    *   For the temperature to be stable (in equilibrium), `Power_absorbed = Power_radiated`.\n    *   Therefore, `T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a²`.\n    *   By taking the fourth root of both sides, we find the relationship between temperature and orbital distance: `T_eq ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4) = 1/a^(1/2)`.\n    *   This can be rearranged to express the orbital distance in terms of temperature: `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Period (P) to Orbital Distance (a):**\n    *   According to Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    *   The law is expressed as: `P² ∝ a³`.\n    *   This can be written as: `P ∝ a^(3/2)`.\n    *   Note: The masses of the planets are negligible compared to the star's mass, so the provided mass ratios are extraneous information not needed for this calculation. Similarly, the specific albedo value is not required, only that it is the same for all planets, which is already incorporated into our proportionality.\n\n4.  **Combine the Relationships to Find P in terms of T_eq:**\n    *   We have two relationships:\n        1.  `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n        2.  `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`\n    *   Substitute the second relationship into the first:\n        `P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2)`\n        `P ∝ 1/(T_eq^(2 * 3/2))`\n        `P ∝ 1/T_eq³`\n    *   This shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Desired Ratio:**\n    *   Using the relationship `P ∝ 1/T_eq³`, we can set up the ratio for P₃ and P₁:\n        `P₃ / P₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)³`\n    *   We need to find the temperature ratio `T_eq₁ / T_eq₃`. We are given:\n        *   `T_eq₁ / T_eq₂ = 1.4`\n        *   `T_eq₂ / T_eq₃ = 2.3`\n    *   We can find the required ratio by multiplying the given ratios:\n        `T_eq₁ / T_eq₃ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂) * (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Now substitute the temperature ratio back into our period ratio equation:\n        `P₃ / P₁ = (3.22)³`\n    *   Calculating this value: `3.22 * 3.22 * 3.22 ≈ 33.386`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value is approximately 33.4.\n\nThis matches option D.\nI will use the following Python code to perform the calculation accurately.\n```python\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\nt1_t2_ratio = 1.4\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3.\nt2_t3_ratio = 2.3\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 to Planet3 is the product of the two given ratios.\n# (T_eq1/T_eq2) * (T_eq2/T_eq3) = T_eq1/T_eq3\nt1_t3_ratio = t1_t2_ratio * t2_t3_ratio\n\n# From physics principles, the orbital period (P) is related to the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) by P ∝ 1/(T_eq^3).\n# Therefore, the ratio of the periods P3/P1 is equal to (T_eq1/T_eq3)^3.\np3_p1_ratio = t1_t3_ratio**3\n\n# Print the final result, which is the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.\nprint(p3_p1_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n33.386248\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<D>>>",
