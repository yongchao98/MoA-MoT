    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be expressed as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its star. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio:** Now, I'll set up the ratio for the two planets:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and will cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo, so `A_1 = A_2`, meaning the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` terms also cancel. After simplification, the ratio becomes:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a_1)) * ((2 * a_2) / R_star) )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    This is a key simplification. The problem now is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observable Quantities:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. This method measures the star's velocity wobble caused by the orbiting planet. The amplitude of this velocity is denoted as `K`. The formula for `K`, assuming a circular orbit, is:\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)) * (2πG / P)^(1/3)\n    where `M_p` is planet mass, `M_star` is star mass, `i` is inclination, `P` is orbital period, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n    This formula is a bit complex. Let's try a more direct relationship derived from orbital mechanics and momentum conservation.\n    For a circular orbit:\n    *   Planet's orbital velocity: v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a) (assuming M_p << M_star)\n    *   Conservation of momentum: M_p * v_p = M_star * v_star\n    *   The measured RV amplitude `K` is the star's velocity along our line of sight: K = v_star * sin(i)\n\n    Combining these:\n    K = (M_p * v_p / M_star) * sin(i)\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) * sin(i)\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G/a)\n\n6.  **Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now I can set up a ratio for the two planets using the formula for K.\n    K_1 = (M_p1 * sin(i_1) / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G/a_1)\n    K_2 = (M_p2 * sin(i_2) / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G/a_2)\n\n    Let's divide the first equation by the second:\n    K_1 / K_2 = [ (M_p1 * sin(i_1) * sqrt(G/a_1)) / ... ] / [ (M_p2 * sin(i_2) * sqrt(G/a_2)) / ... ]\n    The terms `sqrt(M_star)` and `sqrt(G)` are common and cancel out.\n    K_1 / K_2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (sin(i_1) / sin(i_2)) * sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    The problem states both planets are detected via the transit method. This implies their orbital planes are aligned with our line of sight, meaning the inclination `i` for both is very close to 90°. Therefore, sin(i_1) ≈ sin(i_2) ≈ 1, and these terms cancel out.\n    K_1 / K_2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n7.  **Isolate the Target Ratio:** I need `sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`, which is equal to `T_eq1 / T_eq2`. I'll rearrange the equation:\n    sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = (K_1 / K_2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)\n\n8.  **Connect to Given Data:**\n    *   The radial velocity amplitude `K` is related to the Doppler shift `Δλ` by: `K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`. Therefore, the ratio `K_1 / K_2` is simply `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n    *   `Δλ_1` = 0.03 Å\n    *   `Δλ_2` = 0.04 Å\n    *   So, `K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75`.\n\n    *   The masses are given:\n    *   `M_p1` = 7 M_earth\n    *   `M_p2` = 5 M_earth\n    *   So, `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`.\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Substitute these values back into the equation for the temperature ratio:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = (K_1 / K_2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (0.75) * (5 / 7)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15 / 28\n\n10. **Perform the Final Computation:** To get a decimal value and check against the options, I will perform the division.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is what we need to find.\n# We found this to be equal to (K1 / K2) * (M_p2 / M_p1).\n\n# Given values:\n# Doppler shift for Planet 1 (proportional to K1)\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03\n\n# Doppler shift for Planet 2 (proportional to K2)\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04\n\n# Mass of Planet 1\nm_p1 = 7.0\n\n# Mass of Planet 2\nm_p2 = 5.0\n\n# Calculate the ratio of radial velocity amplitudes (K1/K2)\nK1_over_K2 = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of planet masses (M_p2/M_p1)\nm_p2_over_m_p1 = m_p2 / m_p1\n\n# Calculate the final temperature ratio\ntemp_ratio = K1_over_K2 * m_p2_over_m_p1\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\n>>>0.5357142857142857\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.5357, which rounds to 0.53. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2).\nRatio = T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for both and cancel out. We are also told that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂), so the (1-A) term also cancels out.\nThe simplified ratio is:\nRatio = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))\nRatio = sqrt( (1/a₁) / (1/a₂) ) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a₂/a₁, using the information from the radial velocity method. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, `i` is the orbital inclination, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `a` is the semi-major axis.\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes for the two planets is:\nK₁ / K₂ = [(M_p1 * sin(i₁) / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a₁)] / [(M_p2 * sin(i₂) / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a₂)]\n\nSince both planets are detected via the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on, so the inclination `i` for both is approximately 90 degrees. Thus, sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂) ≈ 1, and these terms cancel out. The star's mass (M_star) and the gravitational constant (G) are also the same and cancel. The equation simplifies to:\nK₁ / K₂ = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nWe can solve for `sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`:\nsqrt(a₂ / a₁) = (K₁ / K₂) * (M_p2 / M_p1)\n\nFrom our first derivation, we know that T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁). Therefore:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (K₁ / K₂) * (M_p2 / M_p1)\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ (K = c * Δλ / λ₀). So, the ratio K₁/K₂ is equal to the ratio Δλ₁/Δλ₂.\nGiven values:\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n\nNow, we can substitute the values:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (0.03 / 0.04) * (5 / 7)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15 / 28\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\nComparing our result with the options provided:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
