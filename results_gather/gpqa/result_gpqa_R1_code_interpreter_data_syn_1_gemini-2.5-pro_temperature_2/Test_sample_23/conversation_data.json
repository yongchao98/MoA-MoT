    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the unknown hydrocarbon Z.**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the molecular formula of Z be C_n H_m.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass Fraction (H) = (m * Atomic Mass of H) / (n * Atomic Mass of C + m * Atomic Mass of H)\n\nUsing integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1):\n0.1428 ≈ (m * 1) / (n * 12 + m * 1)\nThe value 14.28% is very close to 1/7.\n1/7 = m / (12n + m)\n7m = 12n + m\n6m = 12n\nm = 2n\n\nSo, the molecular formula of Z is C_n H_2n.\nThe problem also states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the composition of mixtures X and Y.**\n*   **Mixture Y**: It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates the components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   We know Z (a cycloalkane, C_n H_2n) is one component of Y.\n    *   Y is formed from a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation involves both oxidation and reduction. The starting materials are unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons (from mixture X). A common outcome of such a reaction over a catalyst like Platinum is the formation of a fully saturated compound (the cycloalkane Z) and a fully dehydrogenated, stable aromatic compound.\n    *   The aromatic analog with the same C_n skeleton would be a benzene derivative. The general formula for this homologous series (benzene, toluene, xylene...) is C_n H_{2n-6}. Aromatic compounds do not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y consists of the cycloalkane Z and its corresponding aromatic analog: **Y = {C_n H_2n, C_n H_{2n-6}}**.\n\n*   **Mixture X**: It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. This means they are unsaturated.\n    *   Upon hydrogenation, both components of X give only Z (C_n H_2n). This confirms that they both have the same C_n carbon skeleton as Z. They must be a cycloalkene or a cycloalkadiene.\n    *   Mixture X reacts to form mixture Y in an equimolar ratio: X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen atom balance:\n        Total H atoms in Y = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in X must also be 4n - 6.\n    *   The logical components for X are a cycloalkene (one double bond, formula C_n H_{2n-2}) and a cycloalkadiene (two double bonds, formula C_n H_{2n-4}).\n    *   Total H atoms in {C_n H_{2n-2}, C_n H_{2n-4}} = (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6.\n    *   This perfectly matches the hydrogen count in Y. So, **X = {C_n H_{2n-2}, C_n H_{2n-4}}**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the specific carbon number, n.**\nThe problem states that molecules in mixture X have no conjugated multiple bonds. This means the cycloalkadiene, C_n H_{2n-4}, must have a non-conjugated structure.\n*   For n=5, the cycloalkadiene is cyclopentadiene (C5H6), which is conjugated. A non-conjugated isomer is not plausible.\n*   For n=6, the cycloalkadiene is C6H8. A non-conjugated isomer, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, exists. Z would be cyclohexane (C6H12). This is a very widely used solvent. The entire reaction scheme (1,4-cyclohexadiene + cyclohexene → benzene + cyclohexane) is a classic example of catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n*   For n=7, the cycloalkadiene is C7H10. Non-conjugated isomers exist (e.g., methyl-1,4-cyclohexadienes). Z would be methylcyclohexane (C7H14), which is also a solvent.\n\nBoth n=6 and n=7 seem possible based on the chemical rules. However, chemistry problems of this nature often refer to the most common and fundamental chemical examples. The system based on the 6-membered ring (cyclohexane, cyclohexene, cyclohexadiene, benzene) is a textbook case. Also, cyclohexane is arguably more \"widely used\" as a generic solvent than methylcyclohexane. Therefore, n=6 is the most plausible intended answer.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\nFrom Step 2, the components of X are C_n H_{2n-2} and C_n H_{2n-4}.\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6.\nSubstituting n = 6:\nTotal H atoms = 4 * 6 - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18.\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nLet's quickly check the calculations using a python script.\n```python\n# Based on the reasoning, the formula for the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X is 4n-6.\n# We concluded that n=6 is the most probable answer.\nn = 6\ntotal_hydrogen_atoms = 4 * n - 6\nprint(total_hydrogen_atoms)\n\n# We also considered n=7 as a possibility.\n# n = 7\n# total_hydrogen_atoms_n7 = 4 * n - 6\n# print(total_hydrogen_atoms_n7)\n```\n\nThe script will confirm that for n=6, the answer is 18.\n\nFinal answer calculation:\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's denote its formula as C_n H_m.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: (mass of H) / (total molar mass) = (m × 1.008) / (n × 12.011 + m × 1.008) ≈ 0.1428.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (H=1, C=12) for simplicity, the ratio is m / (12n + m).\n    *   The value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   So, we can set up the approximation: m / (12n + m) ≈ 1/7.\n    *   This gives 7m ≈ 12n + m, which simplifies to 6m ≈ 12n, or m = 2n.\n    *   The general formula for Z is C_n H_2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_2n must be a **cycloalkane**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixtures X and Y and the Reaction:**\n    *   **Mixture Y:** An equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (the cycloalkane, C_n H_2n). Y is formed from a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation reactions of cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons, especially over a catalyst like platinum, often involve hydrogen transfer, producing a fully saturated compound and a fully unsaturated (aromatic) compound.\n    *   The aromatic analog to the cycloalkane C_n H_2n would have the same carbon skeleton. Aromatic compounds (like benzene and its derivatives) do not decolorize bromine water under these conditions. The general formula for a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is C_n H_{2n-6}.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of the cycloalkane and its corresponding aromatic derivative: **Y = { C_n H_2n , C_n H_{2n-6} }**.\n\n    *   **Mixture X:** An equimolar mixture of two liquids that *does* decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of C=C double bonds. Upon hydrogenation, both components of X yield only Z (C_n H_2n), meaning they both have the same C_n carbon skeleton.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation that produces an equimolar mixture. This suggests a 1:1 hydrogen transfer reaction between the two components of X.\n        Let's balance the atoms.\n        Total H atoms in one mole of Y = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6.\n        This must be equal to the total H atoms in one mole of X.\n    *   The components of X must be unsaturated versions of the C_n skeleton. Let's consider a cycloalkene (one double bond, C_n H_{2n-2}) and a cycloalkadiene (two double bonds, C_n H_{2n-4}).\n    *   Total H atoms for this combination = (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6.\n    *   This perfectly matches the hydrogen count. So, the components of X are a cycloalkene and a cycloalkadiene. **X = { C_n H_{2n-2} , C_n H_{2n-4} }**.\n    *   The reaction is: C_n H_{2n-2} (cycloalkene) + C_n H_{2n-4} (cycloalkadiene) → C_n H_2n (cycloalkane) + C_n H_{2n-6} (aromatic). This is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n\n3.  **Determine the Value of n:**\n    *   The problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X. This restricts the structure of the cycloalkadiene (C_n H_{2n-4}).\n    *   Also, Z is \"widely used as a solvent.\"\n    *   Let's consider n=6.\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). A very common solvent. This fits.\n        *   Y = { Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6) }.\n        *   X = { Cyclohexene (C6H10), Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) }. The non-conjugated isomer is 1,4-cyclohexadiene. This structure is possible and fits the condition.\n    *   All conditions are met for n=6. The reaction scheme is:\n        Cyclohexene (C6H10) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The liquids in mixture X are Cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = (atoms in C6H10) + (atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   We can confirm this with our general formula: Total H = 4n - 6. For n=6, Total H = 4(6) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18.\n\nTo verify the final calculation:\n```python\n# Based on the derived structures, the two liquids in mixture X are\n# cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n# We need to find the sum of hydrogen atoms in these two molecules.\nH_in_cyclohexene = 10\nH_in_cyclohexadiene = 8\ntotal_hydrogen_atoms = H_in_cyclohexene + H_in_cyclohexadiene\nprint(total_hydrogen_atoms)\n```",
