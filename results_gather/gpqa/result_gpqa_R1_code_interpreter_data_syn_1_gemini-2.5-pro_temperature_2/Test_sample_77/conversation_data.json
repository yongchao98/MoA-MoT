    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge *q*. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, the speed of light *c*. Therefore, the field measured at a position $\\vec{r}$ at time *t* is determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, the \"retarded time\" $t_r$.\n\n### 1. Definitions and Relationships\n\n*   **Source charge:** *q*\n*   **Observation point (field point):** $\\vec{r}$\n*   **Observation time:** *t*\n*   **Trajectory of the charge:** $\\vec{s}(t')$\n*   **Retarded time ($t_r$):** The time at which the charge emitted the field that reaches $\\vec{r}$ at time *t*. The signal travels a distance *d* in a time interval $t-t_r$.\n    *   $t = t_r + \\frac{d}{c}$\n*   **Source position at retarded time:** $\\vec{s}_r = \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n*   **Separation vector:** The vector from the source position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}_r$\n*   **Distance to source at retarded time:** $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}_r|$\n*   **Velocity of the charge at retarded time:** $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}\\bigg|_{t'=t_r}$\n\n### 2. Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general expressions for the potentials for time-varying charge and current distributions are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\nwhere $t_r' = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\n### 3. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge *q* moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the charge density and current density are represented using Dirac delta functions:\n\n*   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas is not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r'$ inside the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The standard evaluation of these integrals (found in any advanced textbook on E&M, like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\") leads to the following result.\n\nThe effect of the source's motion is to modify the denominator of the potential expressions. This is a relativistic effect, related to the apparent compression or expansion of the volume element of the source as seen by the observer. The integration yields an extra factor of $(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)^{-1}$.\n\nThe resulting potentials are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})}$\n\nwhere all quantities on the right-hand side ($\\vec{d}, d, \\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### 4. Matching with the Options\n\nLet's rewrite the derived potentials to match the format of the given options.\nThe denominator term is:\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) = d(1 - \\frac{(\\vec{d}/d) \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expressions for V and A:\n\n**Scalar Potential V:**\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**Vector Potential A:**\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese two expressions exactly match option A.\n\n### 5. Checking other options:\n*   **Option B and D** use the static potential $V = q/(4\\pi\\epsilon_o r)$, which is only valid for a stationary charge or in the non-relativistic limit under certain conditions. This is incorrect for a general moving charge. Option B also has a dimensionally incorrect formula for A.\n*   **Option C** has a `+` sign in the denominator instead of a `-`. A positive sign would imply that the potential from a charge moving towards the observer is weaker, which contradicts the physical Doppler effect for light emission. The minus sign is correct.\n\nTherefore, Option A provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. It can also be verified that for these expressions, the relation $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$ holds, since $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
