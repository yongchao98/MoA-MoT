    "*   **Analysis for Tautomerism (Part A):**\n    *   Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible constitutional isomers, most commonly involving the migration of a proton. A key type is keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one α-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group). This carbon must typically be sp³-hybridized.\n    *   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at positions 1 and 4, and two C=C bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds. They are sp²-hybridized and do not have α-hydrogens in the sense required for standard keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups. These are sp³-hybridized carbons, and the hydrogens attached to them are α-hydrogens. In fact, these hydrogens are particularly acidic as they are located between two carbonyl groups. The compound readily undergoes tautomerization to form its enol tautomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is aromatic and thus highly stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis for Optical Isomerism (Part B):**\n    *   Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n            1.  -H (hydrogen)\n            2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n            3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n            4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry, so it is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (exist as a pair of enantiomers).\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with a *trans* arrangement across the C=C double bond. This molecule does not have any carbon atom bonded to four different groups, so it has no chiral center. Furthermore, the molecule has a center of inversion, which makes it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Decision:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is benzoquinone.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
