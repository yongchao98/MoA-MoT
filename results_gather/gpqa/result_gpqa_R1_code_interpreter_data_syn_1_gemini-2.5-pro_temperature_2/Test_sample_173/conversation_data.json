    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is given as $E_{initial} = M c^2 = 300$ GeV. Since it's at rest, its initial kinetic energy is 0, and its initial momentum is 0.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. They are moving, so they have kinetic energies $T_1$ and $T_2$ and momenta $\\vec{p_1}$ and $\\vec{p_2}$.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\nThe problem gives two conditions for the fragment masses:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: $m_1 = 2 m_2$. We'll define $m_1$ as the more massive fragment.\n2.  The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations:\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second: $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n*   This gives $m_2 = 0.33 M$.\n*   Then, $m_1 = 2 m_2 = 2 \\times (0.33 M) = 0.66 M$.\n\nNow, let's find their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   $m_1 c^2 = 0.66 \\times (M c^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198$ GeV.\n*   $m_2 c^2 = 0.33 \\times (M c^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99$ GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies:\n*   $Q = T_1 + T_2 = E_{initial, rest} - E_{final, rest}$\n*   $Q = M c^2 - (m_1 c^2 + m_2 c^2)$\n*   $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 - 297 = 3$ GeV.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial nucleus was at rest (momentum = 0). Therefore, the total momentum of the fragments must also be zero.\n*   $\\vec{p_1} + \\vec{p_2} = \\vec{0} \\implies \\vec{p_1} = -\\vec{p_2}$.\n*   This means the magnitudes of their momenta are equal: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n\n**5. Calculate $T_1$ using Classical Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\n*   $T_{1, classic} = p^2 / (2 m_1)$\n*   $T_{2, classic} = p^2 / (2 m_2)$\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n*   $\\frac{T_{1, classic}}{T_{2, classic}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2 m_1)}{p^2 / (2 m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n*   So, $T_{2, classic} = 2 T_{1, classic}$.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy, $Q = 3$ GeV:\n*   $T_{1, classic} + T_{2, classic} = 3$ GeV\n*   $T_{1, classic} + 2 T_{1, classic} = 3$ GeV\n*   $3 T_{1, classic} = 3$ GeV\n*   $T_{1, classic} = 1$ GeV = 1000 MeV.\n\n**6. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) $T_1$**\n\nIn relativity, we use the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, where $E$ is the total energy ($E = T + mc^2$).\nFrom the conservation of momentum ($p_1 = p_2$), we have:\n*   $(p_1 c)^2 = (p_2 c)^2$\n*   $E_1^2 - (m_1 c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2 c^2)^2$\n\nConservation of total energy states that the total energy of the fragments equals the rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus:\n*   $E_1 + E_2 = M c^2 = 300$ GeV.\n\nWe now have a system of two equations for the total energies $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n1.  $E_1 + E_2 = 300$\n2.  $E_1^2 - E_2^2 = (m_1 c^2)^2 - (m_2 c^2)^2 = 198^2 - 99^2$\n\nFactor the second equation: $(E_1 - E_2)(E_1 + E_2) = 198^2 - 99^2$.\n*   $(E_1 - E_2)(300) = (198 - 99)(198 + 99) = (99)(297)$\n*   $E_1 - E_2 = \\frac{99 \\times 297}{300} = \\frac{29403}{300} = 98.01$ GeV.\n\nNow we solve the simpler linear system:\n1.  $E_1 + E_2 = 300$ GeV\n2.  $E_1 - E_2 = 98.01$ GeV\n\nAdding the two equations gives:\n*   $2E_1 = 398.01$ GeV\n*   $E_1 = 199.005$ GeV.\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy $T_1$ is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n*   $T_1 = E_1 - m_1 c^2 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005$ GeV.\n*   $T_1 = 1005$ MeV.\n\n**7. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = $T_1 - T_{1, classic}$\n*   Difference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5$ MeV.\n\nTo be certain of the arithmetic, we can run a short python script.\n\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV\nMc2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate rest-mass energies of the fragments\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\n\n# Calculate total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Calculate kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) using classical mechanics\n# In the classical limit, T1/Q = m2/(m1+m2).\nT1_classic_GeV = Q * (m2c2 / (m1c2 + m2c2))\n\n# Calculate the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) using relativistic mechanics\n# From conservation of energy: E1 + E2 = Mc2\n# From conservation of momentum: p1 = p2, which leads to E1 - E2 = (m1c2^2 - m2c2^2) / Mc2\n# Solving the system for E1:\nE1_GeV = (Mc2 + (m1c2**2 - m2c2**2) / Mc2) / 2.0\n# The relativistic kinetic energy is T1 = E1 - m1c2\nT1_relativistic_GeV = E1_GeV - m1c2\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classic_GeV) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"{difference_MeV}\")\n```\n>>>\n5.0\n<<<\n\nThe calculated difference is exactly 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>",

Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n#### **Step 1: Define initial and final state properties.**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   One nucleus at rest.\n    *   Mass: M.\n    *   Rest-mass energy: $E_{initial} = Mc^2 = 300$ GeV.\n    *   Initial momentum: $\\vec{P}_{initial} = \\vec{0}$.\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n    *   Let $m_1$ be the more massive fragment.\n    *   Given: $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n    *   Given: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n    *   Fragments have kinetic energies $T_1$, $T_2$ and momenta $\\vec{p_1}$, $\\vec{p_2}$.\n\n#### **Step 2: Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments.**\n\nWe solve the system of equations for the masses:\n1.  Substitute $m_1 = 2m_2$ into the second equation:\n    $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M$.\n2.  Now find $m_1$:\n    $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2 \\times (0.33 M) = 0.66 M$.\n\nNow, let's find their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n#### **Step 3: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n\nThe energy released, which becomes the kinetic energy of the fragments, is the difference between the initial rest energy and the sum of the final rest energies.\n*   $Q = T_1 + T_2 = (\\text{Initial rest energy}) - (\\text{Final rest energy})$\n*   $Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n*   $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n#### **Step 4: Calculate $T_1$ using the classical approximation.**\n\nBy conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final total momentum must be zero: $\\vec{p_1} + \\vec{p_2} = \\vec{0}$, which means their momentum magnitudes are equal: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n*   $T_{1,classic} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$\n*   $T_{2,classic} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n$\\frac{T_{1,classic}}{T_{2,classic}} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThis gives $T_{2,classic} = 2 T_{1,classic}$.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy, $Q=3$ GeV:\n*   $T_{1,classic} + T_{2,classic} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $T_{1,classic} + 2T_{1,classic} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $3T_{1,classic} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $T_{1,classic} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n#### **Step 5: Calculate the correct (relativistic) $T_1$.**\n\nWe use the conservation laws again.\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum**: $p_1 = p_2 = p$. The relativistic momentum is related to total energy E and rest mass m by $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$. Since momenta are equal, $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$, so:\n    $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy**: The initial energy was $Mc^2$. This must equal the total energy of the two final fragments ($E_1$ and $E_2$ are the total energies, i.e., rest energy + kinetic energy).\n    $E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nWe have a system of two equations for $E_1$ and $E_2$:\na) $E_1 + E_2 = 300$\nb) $E_1^2 - (198)^2 = E_2^2 - (99)^2 \\implies E_1^2 - E_2^2 = 198^2 - 99^2$\n\nWe can factor equation (b) as $(E_1 - E_2)(E_1 + E_2) = (198 - 99)(198 + 99)$.\nSubstituting (a) into this:\n$(E_1 - E_2)(300) = (99)(297)$\n$E_1 - E_2 = \\frac{99 \\times 297}{300} = \\frac{29403}{300} = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nNow we solve the simple linear system:\n*   $E_1 + E_2 = 300.00$ GeV\n*   $E_1 - E_2 = 98.01$ GeV\n\nAdding the two equations yields:\n$2E_1 = 398.01 \\text{ GeV} \\implies E_1 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe kinetic energy $T_1$ is the total energy $E_1$ minus the rest-mass energy $m_1c^2$:\n*   $T_{1,relativistic} = E_1 - m_1c^2 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   $T_{1,relativistic} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n#### **Step 6: Calculate the difference.**\n\nThe difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value.\n*   Difference = $T_{1,relativistic} - T_{1,classic}$\n*   Difference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe following Python code automates and confirms this calculation.\n\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV. 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\nMc2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate rest-mass energies of the fragments from the problem statement.\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99*M and m1 = 2*m2 => 3*m2 = 0.99*M => m2 = 0.33*M, m1 = 0.66*M\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\n\n# The Q-value is the energy released as kinetic energy.\n# Q = Initial_Rest_Energy - Final_Rest_Energy\nQ_value = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# ----- Classical Calculation -----\n# In classical mechanics, T = p^2/(2m).
