    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main goal is to determine which of the two planets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting its host star and by what factor.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`). For a circular orbit, the semi-major axis is simply the orbital radius.\n    `p_trans = R_s / a`\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities:** The problem provides information about the planets' orbital periods (`P`) and the host stars' masses (`M_s`), but not the semi-major axis (`a`) directly. We need to express `a` in terms of `P` and `M_s`. This is achieved using Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion:\n    `P^2 = (4 * π^2 / (G * M_s)) * a^3`\n    where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (`a`):**\n    Rearranging Kepler's Third Law to solve for `a`:\n    `a^3 = (G * M_s * P^2) / (4 * π^2)`\n    `a = ( (G * M_s * P^2) / (4 * π^2) )^(1/3)`\n    Since `G` and `4π^2` are constants, we can establish a proportionality:\n    `a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)` or `a ∝ M_s^(1/3) * P^(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Substitute `a` into the Transit Probability Formula:**\n    Now we substitute the expression for `a` back into the transit probability formula:\n    `p_trans ∝ R_s / a`\n    `p_trans ∝ R_s / (M_s^(1/3) * P^(2/3))`\n\n6.  **Set up the Ratio of Probabilities:** To compare the two planets, we will calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, `p_trans_1 / p_trans_2`.\n    `Ratio = p_trans_1 / p_trans_2 = [ R_s1 / (M_s1^(1/3) * P1^(2/3)) ] / [ R_s2 / (M_s2^(1/3) * P2^(2/3)) ]`\n\n7.  **Simplify the Ratio Expression:**\n    By rearranging the terms, we get:\n    `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3) * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\n8.  **Plug in the Given Values:** The problem provides the following relationships:\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`, so `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n    *   The mass of Star 1 is twice the mass of Star 2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`, so `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`.\n    *   The period of Planet 1 is one-third the period of Planet 2: `P1 = P2 / 3`, so `P2 / P1 = 3`.\n\n9.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Substitute these values into the simplified ratio expression:\n    `Ratio = (1) * (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)`\n    `Ratio = 3^(2/3) / 2^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (3^2)^(1/3) / 2^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = 9^(1/3) / 2^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (9/2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)`\n\n10. **Compute the Numerical Value:** To find the precise factor, we need to compute the value of `4.5^(1/3)`. A simple estimation shows that `1^3=1` and `2^3=8`, so the value must be between 1 and 2. Let's use Python to get an accurate result.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2.\n# Ratio = p_trans_1 / p_trans_2\n# Based on the derived formula: Ratio = (3^(2/3)) / (2^(1/3))\n\nratio = (3**(2/3)) / (2**(1/3))\nprint(ratio)\n```\nThe result of this calculation is approximately 1.65. Since the ratio `p_trans_1 / p_trans_2` is ~1.65, this means the transit probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than for Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The probability of a planet transiting its host star (`p_trans`) is determined by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`):\n`p_trans = R_s / a`\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis (`a`) is related to the orbital period (`P`) and the host star's mass (`M_s`) as follows:\n`a³ ∝ M_s * P²`\nWhich can be rearranged to:\n`a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)` or `a ∝ M_s^(1/3) * P^(2/3)`\n\nBy substituting this expression for `a` into the transit probability formula, we get:\n`p_trans ∝ R_s / (M_s^(1/3) * P^(2/3))`\n\nTo find which planet has a higher transit probability, we can compute the ratio of the probability for Planet_1 to that of Planet_2 (`p_trans_1 / p_trans_2`):\n`Ratio = p_trans_1 / p_trans_2 = [ R_s1 / (M_s1^(1/3) * P1^(2/3)) ] / [ R_s2 / (M_s2^(1/3) * P2^(2/3)) ]`\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n`Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3) * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\nNow, we can use the information given in the problem:\n1.  Both host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`, so `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n2.  The mass of the star hosting Planet_1 is twice that of the host star of Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`, so `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`.\n3.  The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2: `P1 = P2 / 3`, so `P2 / P1 = 3`.\n\nSubstituting these values into the ratio equation:\n`Ratio = (1) * (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)`\n`Ratio = 3^(2/3) / 2^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (3²)^(1/3) / 2^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = 9^(1/3) / 2^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)`\n\nCalculating the value of this ratio gives approximately 1.65.\nSince the ratio `p_trans_1 / p_trans_2 ≈ 1.65`, this means the transit probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that for Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred object to observe.\n\n<<<C>>>"
