    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent:** Phenyl ethan-1-one, which is also known as acetophenone. This means there is an acetyl group (-COCH₃) attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other, forming a 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, the existing substituents on the ring direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Weakly deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe goal is to achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. The best strategies usually involve introducing *meta*-directing groups first, or using special techniques involving temporary directing groups.\n\n**Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene (-NO₂, a *meta*-director).\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction of -NO₂ to -NH₂). The amino group (-NH₂) is a strongly activating *ortho, para*-director.\n*   iii) Aniline + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction does not work as intended. The basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid (AlCl₃), forming a highly deactivating complex (-NH₃⁺AlCl₃⁻), which shuts down the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Furthermore, N-acylation is more likely than ring acylation.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence fails at step iii.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt (diazotization).\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium salt + H₃PO₂ → Benzene (deamination).\n*   **Conclusion:** Steps i-iv start with benzene and return to benzene, making this sequence inefficient and nonsensical.\n\n**Option C: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene. The bromo group (-Br) is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   ii) Bromobenzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → A mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene (*ortho*) and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (*para*). Neither product has the *meta* relationship required as a precursor for the 1,3,5 pattern.\n*   iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation on either bromonitrobenzene isomer would fail or give a very low yield because the ring is strongly deactivated by both the bromo and nitro groups.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence leads to the wrong isomers and involves a non-viable reaction.\n\n**Option D: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\nLet's analyze the first three steps, as this is a potential direct route.\n*   **i) Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone.** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a *meta*-director. This is a good starting point for creating a 1,3,5-pattern.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position. Now we have substituents at positions 1 and 3. The groups are -COCH₃ (*m*-director) and -Br (*o,p*-director).\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** For nitration, we consider the directing effects of both groups:\n    *   The -COCH₃ group (at C1) directs *meta* (to C5).\n    *   The -Br group (at C3) directs *ortho* (to C2, C4) and *para* (to C6).\n    *   The positions *ortho* and *para* to the -COCH₃ group (C2, C4, C6) are strongly deactivated. The -Br group's activating resonance effect is not strong enough to overcome this. The least deactivated position on the ring is C5, which is *meta* to both groups. Therefore, nitration occurs preferentially at position 5.\n    *   This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\nThe sequence of steps i, ii, and iii is a chemically sound and well-established method for synthesizing the target compound. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) appear to be erroneous, as they would take the final product, reduce its nitro group, and then perform a series of reactions that seem to reverse part of the synthesis. However, since the initial part of the sequence is the only viable route to the product among all options, this is the correct choice. The question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the product, which this one does after the first three steps.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nComparing the four options, option D is the only one containing a valid synthetic pathway to 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The other options fail due to incorrect reaction feasibility (A, C) or logic (B, C).\n\n<<<D>>>"
