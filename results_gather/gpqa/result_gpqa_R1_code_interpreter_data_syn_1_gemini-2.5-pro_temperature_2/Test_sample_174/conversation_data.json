    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a defined symmetry axis like a spheroid oscillating along that axis, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The problem requires us to determine the angular and wavelength dependence of the radiated power.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the angular dependence of the radiated power.**\n\nThe power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` from a simple oscillating electric dipole whose moment is aligned with the z-axis is given by the formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `θ` is the angle with respect to the z-axis (the axis of oscillation) and `C` is a constant that depends on the dipole moment, frequency, and fundamental constants, but not on the angle `θ`.\n\nThe maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, denoted as `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n\nSo, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * (1)² = C`.\n\nTherefore, we can write the power at any angle `θ` in terms of `A`:\n\n`dP/dΩ = A * sin²(θ)`\n\nThe question asks for the radiated power at an angle `θ = 30°`. We can calculate this:\n\n`dP/dΩ` at `30° = A * sin²(30°)`\n\nSince `sin(30°) = 1/2`, we have:\n\n`sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nSo, the power radiated at `30°` is `A/4`. The fraction of `A` that is radiated at this angle is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\nThis part of the reasoning can be confirmed with a simple calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The angle in degrees\ntheta_deg = 30\n\n# Convert degrees to radians for the sin function\ntheta_rad = math.radians(theta_deg)\n\n# The radiated power is proportional to sin^2(theta). The maximum power (A)\n# corresponds to sin^2(90) = 1.\n# The fraction of the maximum power at 30 degrees is sin^2(30).\nfraction = (math.sin(theta_rad))**2\n\nprint(f\"The value of sin^2(30 degrees) is: {fraction}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe value of sin^2(30 degrees) is: 0.25000000000000006\n<<<\n\nThe calculation confirms that the fraction is `0.25` or `1/4`. This narrows the possible answers down to B) and C).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the wavelength dependence of the radiated power.**\n\nThe full formula for the power radiated per unit solid angle by an oscillating electric dipole is:\n\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀²ω⁴ / (32π²ε₀c³)) * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `p₀` is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment.\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe function `f` in the problem is this `dP/dΩ`. We are interested in its dependence on the wavelength `λ`. The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by:\n\n`ω = 2π * (frequency) = 2π * (c/λ)`\n\nSo, the `ω⁴` term in the power formula becomes:\n\n`ω⁴ = (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴`\n\nTherefore, the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to `1/λ⁴`.\n\n`dP/dΩ = f(λ, θ) ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis is the famous dependence found in Rayleigh scattering, which is essentially radiation from induced dipoles.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results.**\n\nFrom Step 1, the fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\nFrom Step 2, a possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nCombining these two results, we get:\nFraction = `1/4`\nFunctional form dependence on wavelength = `λ⁻⁴`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\nB) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\nC) 1/4, λ⁻³\nD) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An oscillating charge distribution with a defined symmetry axis, such as a spheroid oscillating along its axis, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The radiated power from such a system has specific dependencies on the angle of observation and the wavelength of the radiation.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` from an oscillating electric dipole whose moment is aligned with the z-axis is given by the Larmor formula for radiation in the far-field:\n`dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\nwhere:\n*   `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n*   `K` is a constant that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment, the frequency of oscillation, and fundamental physical constants, but it is independent of the angle `θ`.\n\nThe maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, denoted as `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which happens when `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\nTherefore, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = K * sin²(90°) = K * 1 = K`.\n\nSo we can express the power radiated at any angle `θ` in terms of the maximum power `A`:\n`dP/dΩ = A * sin²(θ)`\n\nThe question asks for the fraction of the maximum power that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We calculate the power at this angle:\n`dP/dΩ (at θ=30°) = A * sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nTherefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nThe power radiated at `30°` is `A/4`.\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\nThis eliminates options A and D.\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe term `K` (which we equated to the maximum power `A` in the angular analysis) in the power formula is not a simple constant but depends on the frequency `ω` of oscillation. The full expression for the radiated power per unit solid angle is:\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀²ω⁴ / (32π²ε₀c³)) * sin²(θ)`\nHere, `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment, `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe function `f` in the problem is this power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`. We are interested in its dependence on the wavelength `λ`. The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the expression:\n`ω = 2π * ν = 2π * (c/λ)`\nwhere `ν` is the frequency.\n\nSubstituting this into the power formula, we see that the power is proportional to `ω⁴`:\n`f ∝ ω⁴ = (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of Rayleigh scattering, which is radiation from induced electric dipoles much smaller than the wavelength of light.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining both results:\n*   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
