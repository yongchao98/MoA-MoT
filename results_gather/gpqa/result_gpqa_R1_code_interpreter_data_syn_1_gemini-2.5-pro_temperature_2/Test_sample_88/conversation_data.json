    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to deduce the properties of the intermediates.**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is a rigid, tricyclic saturated alkane derivative with formula C₁₀H₁₄Br₂.\n2.  **Product 1:** Formed by heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C.\n    *   The formula is deduced from the reaction C₁₀H₁₄Br₂ + 2KOH → C₁₀H₁₄O + 2KBr + H₂O. The proton count in the product (from NMR: 2+10+2 = 14H) is the same as in the starting material.\n    *   The IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a ketone (C=O) group.\n    *   The problem states that Product 2 (derived from Product 1) undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double or triple bonds. This implies that Product 1 (and 2) must contain a C=C bond.\n    *   Therefore, Product 1 is a ketone that also contains a C=C double bond. The IR value of 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests the ketone is not conjugated with the double bond (a conjugated ketone would typically show a C=O stretch at a lower frequency, ~1685 cm⁻¹).\n    *   The adamantane framework is tricyclic. A molecule with a C=O and a C=C has two degrees of unsaturation. To achieve the total of four degrees of unsaturation calculated from the formula C₁₀H₁₄O, the molecule must be bicyclic. This means the adamantane cage must have rearranged and opened one ring during the formation of Product 1.\n    *   The ¹H NMR of Product 1 shows a signal at 4.79 ppm (2H). This chemical shift is typical for vinylic protons (protons on a C=C bond). The integration (2H) and the single signal suggest a symmetric double bond of the type R-CH=CH-R'.\n3.  **Product 2:** Formed by heating Product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide.\n    *   This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces ketones to alcohols. The C=C bond is not affected.\n    *   So, Product 2 is an alcohol that contains a C=C double bond, of the form R-CH=CH-R'. The skeleton is the same as in Product 1. Its formula is C₁₀H₁₆O.\n4.  **Product 3:** Formed by ozonolysis of Product 2 (O₃ at -78°C, then DMS).\n    *   This reaction cleaves the C=C bond. The double bond in Product 2 is part of a ring (`...-CH=CH-...`), so its cleavage will open the ring.\n    *   The initial ozonolysis product will be a dialdehyde, as each vinylic CH group is converted to a CHO group.\n    *   Since Product 2 was an alcohol, the resulting molecule, let's call it `Product 3 (intermediate)`, is a hydroxy-dialdehyde. The general structure would be `HO-CₙH₂ₙ-(CHO)₂`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the most deshielded proton in Product 3 and its coupling pattern.**\n\n1.  **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** The intermediate `Product 3` contains three types of protons (ignoring the aliphatic cage protons): the alcohol proton (-OH), the proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol (H-C-OH), and the two aldehyde protons (-CHO).\n    *   Aldehyde protons are exceptionally deshielded and typically resonate at δ 9-10 ppm.\n    *   H-C-OH protons resonate around δ 3.5-4.5 ppm.\n    *   OH protons are exchangeable and their shift is variable. The question excludes these.\n    *   Therefore, the most deshielded protons are the aldehyde protons.\n\n2.  **Initial Analysis of the Aldehyde Proton Coupling:**\n    *   The aldehyde groups are formed from the `...-CH=CH-...` double bond. This means that the carbon atom alpha to each aldehyde carbonyl group is a methine (CH) group.\n    *   The structure is `...-CH(alpha)-CHO`.\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, the aldehyde proton should be coupled to the single proton on the alpha-carbon, which would result in a **doublet**.\n    *   However, \"doublet\" is not one of the answer choices (A) pentet, B) triplet, C) doublet of triplets, D) triplet of triplets). This indicates that this simple analysis is incomplete.\n\n3.  **Refining the Analysis (Considering Plausible Follow-up Reactions and Long-Range Coupling):**\n    *   The conflict between the expected \"doublet\" and the given options suggests either significant long-range coupling is occurring, or the initial ozonolysis product (`Product 3 intermediate`) rearranges into a more stable final structure.\n    *   **Scenario A (Long-Range Coupling):** In rigid polycyclic systems (like those derived from adamantane), long-range (e.g., ⁴J) coupling can be significant. If the aldehyde proton couples to its alpha-proton (1H) and also to an adjacent methylene group (CH₂, 2H), the splitting pattern would be a **doublet of triplets (C)**. This is a plausible scenario. The aldehyde proton signal is split into a doublet by the alpha-proton, and each peak of the doublet is further split into a triplet by the two beta-protons.\n    *   **Scenario B (Rearrangement):** Hydroxy-dialdehydes are often unstable and can spontaneously cyclize to form hemiacetals. Given that Product 3 is a hydroxy-dialdehyde, it could rearrange to form a more stable cyclic bicyclic acetal structure, eliminating the aldehyde groups.\n        `HO-...(ring)...-CH(CHO)-CH(CHO)`  → `...-O-CH-...-CH(OH)-...`\n        In such a cyclic acetal, the most deshielded protons would now be the acetal methine protons (H-C-O-C-...), resonating around δ 4.5-5.5 ppm. Let's consider the coupling of one such proton, Hₐ, in a fragment like `-CH₂-CHₐ(OR)-CHb-...`. It would be coupled to the adjacent methine proton Hb (giving a doublet) and the adjacent methylene protons (-CH₂) (giving a triplet). This again leads to a **doublet of triplets** pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth plausible, more complex analyses lead to the same conclusion. The simple \"doublet\" prediction is flawed because it ignores either long-range coupling common in rigid cages or a likely intramolecular cyclization. Both scenarios point towards a splitting pattern where a proton is coupled to a single proton and a pair of equivalent protons. This pattern is a doublet of triplets.\n\n<<<C>>>"
