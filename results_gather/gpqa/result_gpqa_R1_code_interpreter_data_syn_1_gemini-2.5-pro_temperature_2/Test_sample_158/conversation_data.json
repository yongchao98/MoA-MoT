    "My thinking process to solve this problem involves several steps based on astrophysics and cosmology:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Phenomenon:** The user describes a quasar spectrum with a distinct feature: a peak at 790 nm and a significant flux drop at shorter wavelengths. This is a classic signature of the **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) forest**. The peak corresponds to the quasar's own Lyα emission line, and the drop is caused by the absorption of light by the intergalactic medium (neutral hydrogen clouds) between the quasar and us. The wavelength of this feature is therefore the redshifted Lyα line.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):** The redshift `z` is the measure of how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. It's calculated using the formula:\n    `1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest`\n    *   `λ_observed` is the observed wavelength of the spectral line, which is given as 790 nm.\n    *   `λ_rest` is the rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition of hydrogen, which is a well-known physical constant: 121.567 nm (often approximated as 121.6 nm).\n    *   So, I can calculate `z = (790 / 121.567) - 1`.\n\n3.  **Relate Redshift to Distance:** The question asks for the comoving distance. In cosmology, the relationship between redshift and distance is not linear and depends on the specific cosmological model of the universe. The problem provides the parameters for the standard Lambda-CDM (ΛCDM) model:\n    *   Hubble constant, H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n    *   Matter density parameter, Ω_m = 0.3\n    *   Dark energy density parameter, Ω_Λ = 0.7\n    *   The universe is flat (curvature parameter, Ω_k = 0), which is consistent since Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 1.0.\n\n4.  **Formula for Comoving Distance:** For a flat ΛCDM universe, the comoving distance (D_C) to an object at redshift `z` is given by the integral:\n    D_C = D_H * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')\n    where:\n    *   D_H is the Hubble distance, D_H = c / H₀ (where `c` is the speed of light).\n    *   The integral calculates the \"sum\" of the Hubble distances over the expansion history of the universe up to redshift `z`.\n    *   E(z) is the function that describes how the expansion rate of the universe has changed over time:\n        `E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m * (1 + z)³ + Ω_Λ * (1 + z)^(3*(1+w)))`\n    *   For a cosmological constant (the \"Λ\" in ΛCDM), the dark energy equation of state parameter `w` is -1. This simplifies E(z) to:\n        `E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m * (1 + z)³ + Ω_Λ)`\n\n5.  **Computation:** The integral for the comoving distance does not have a simple analytical solution and must be computed numerically. I will use a Python script to perform this calculation. The script will:\n    a. Define all the given constants (`H₀`, `Ω_m`, `Ω_Λ`, `λ_observed`, `λ_rest`).\n    b. Calculate the redshift `z`.\n    c. Define the integrand function `1 / E(z)`.\n    d. Use a numerical integration routine (from the `scipy` library) to compute the integral from 0 to `z`.\n    e. Multiply the result by the Hubble distance `c/H₀`.\n    f. Convert the final result from Megaparsecs (Mpc) to Gigaparsecs (Gpc) to match the answer choices.\n\nThis computational approach will give a precise value for the comoving distance under the specified cosmological model, which can then be compared to the options provided.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the cosmological parameters and constants\nH0 = 70  # Hubble constant in km/s/Mpc\nOmega_m = 0.3  # Matter density parameter\nOmega_L = 0.7  # Dark energy density parameter\nc = 299792.458  # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# Observed and rest-frame wavelengths for Lyman-alpha\nlambda_obs = 790  # observed wavelength in nm\nlambda_rest = 121.567  # rest-frame Lyman-alpha wavelength in nm\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the redshift (z)\nz = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1\n\n# Step 2: Define the integrand for comoving distance calculation\n# The integrand is 1 / E(z), where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m * (1+z)^3 + Omega_L)\ndef integrand(z_prime):\n    return 1.0 / np.sqrt(Omega_m * (1 + z_prime)**3 + Omega_L)\n\n# Step 3: Numerically integrate from 0 to z\nintegral_result, _ = quad(integrand, 0, z)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the comoving distance\n# Hubble distance D_H = c / H0\nD_H = c / H0\n# Comoving distance in Mpc\nDc_mpc = D_H * integral_result\n\n# Step 5: Convert the result to Gpc and print\nDc_gpc = Dc_mpc / 1000\n\nprint(f\"{Dc_gpc=}\")\n```\n executing code...\n\n>Dc_gpc=8.971932971380905\n\nThe calculated comoving distance is approximately 8.97 Gpc.
