    "This problem asks us to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and then evaluate each of the four statements.\n\nThe \"impulse approximation\" is a framework used to describe the interaction of a probe (like an electron, neutrino, or photon) with a nucleus. Its central idea is that the interaction happens so quickly (like an \"impulse\") that it involves only a single nucleon, which behaves as if it were a free particle, momentarily disconnected from the rest of the nucleus.\n\nLet's analyze each assumption in this context:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    This is a fundamental pillar of the impulse approximation. It simplifies the complex many-body problem into a sum of one-body interactions. It explicitly excludes multi-nucleon phenomena, like meson-exchange currents, where the probe interacts with two or more nucleons simultaneously. This assumption is necessary.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    This assumption addresses what happens before and after the primary interaction. If the incoming probe could interact with other nucleons on its way in, or if the struck nucleon could scatter off other nucleons on its way out (a process called \"final-state interactions\" or FSI), then the observed outcome would be different from an interaction with a truly free nucleon. The assumption of transparency ensures that the initial and final states are simple and are not distorted by the nuclear medium. This is a crucial part of the simplest form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation, or PWIA). This assumption is necessary.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    This is an assumption about the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself, not about its interaction with the nuclear environment. The impulse approximation concerns how a nucleon behaves *within the nucleus*. One can apply the impulse approximation while still using a relativistic model for the quarks inside the nucleon (e.g., in deep inelastic scattering). Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation itself, but rather an additional, separate approximation that might be made in a specific calculation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    This is the very heart of the \"free nucleon\" concept. A nucleon in a nucleus is bound by the strong nuclear force, meaning it has a binding energy and is \"off-shell\". This assumption states that we ignore these binding effects at the moment of the interaction. The nucleon's state is described by its momentum within the nucleus, but during the high-energy collision, this binding is considered negligible. This allows us to use the properties (like mass and form factors) of a free nucleon in the calculation. This assumption is necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe core assumptions that define the impulse approximation are that the interaction targets a single nucleon (1), this nucleon acts as if it's free and unbound during the interaction (4), and there are no further interactions with the rest of the nucleus (2). Assumption (3) is about a different level of physics (the nucleon's internal structure) and is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
