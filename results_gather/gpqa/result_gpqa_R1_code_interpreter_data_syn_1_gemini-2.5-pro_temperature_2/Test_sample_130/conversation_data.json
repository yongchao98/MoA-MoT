    "*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is provided: `1H NMR`: a single peak at 7 ppm; `13C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   Maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid) fits the description of the starting dicarboxylic acid. Upon dehydration, it forms maleic anhydride.\n    *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride:\n        *   `1H NMR`: It has two chemically equivalent protons on the double bond. Due to the molecule's symmetry, these appear as a single peak. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is consistent with vinyl protons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   `13C NMR`: It has two types of carbon atoms. The two equivalent vinyl carbons (C=C) and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). A peak around 137 ppm is typical for alkene carbons in this environment, and a peak around 165 ppm is typical for anhydride carbonyl carbons.\n    *   Thus, the dienophile in the reaction is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the reaction and products.**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   Because the diene is cyclic, the product is a bicyclic system. Specifically, it will have a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes typically yield two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the **endo rule**, the *endo* product is the kinetically favored product and is generally the **major product**. The *exo* product is the thermodynamically more stable but slower-forming product, making it the **minor product**.\n    *   The molecular formula C13H16O3 is consistent with the adduct of C9H14 (the diene) and C4H2O3 (maleic anhydride).\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the structure of the products and assign the NMR signals.**\n    *   Let's sketch the structure of the product. The core is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene.\n        *   Methyl groups are attached to the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) and the vinyl carbons (C2, C3).\n        *   The maleic anhydride moiety is fused at carbons C5 and C6.\n    *   Let's identify the different types of protons and predict their signals:\n        *   **Vinylic Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond are equivalent by symmetry. They will appear as a single peak integrating to 6H. Vinylic methyl protons typically resonate around 1.6-2.0 ppm. We will assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) are also equivalent. They will appear as another single peak integrating to 6H. Being on saturated carbons, they will be more shielded (further upfield) than the vinylic methyls. We will assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons:** The two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (at C5 and C6) are equivalent by symmetry. They are adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, so they will be deshielded. They will appear as a single peak integrating to 2H. We will assign this to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Methylene Bridge Protons:** The CH2 group at C7 has two non-equivalent (diastereotopic) protons. They will couple to each other, likely appearing as two 1H doublets. The signal described as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** likely corresponds to one of these protons.\n\n*   **Step 4: Use NOESY to distinguish between the major (endo) and minor (exo) products.**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Ã…). A cross-peak connects two resonances from protons that are spatially proximate.\n    *   The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   In the **endo (major) product**, the anhydride ring is positioned \"under\" the C2=C3 double bond of the bicyclic system. This brings the anhydride protons (H5, H6, ~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak is expected between these two groups.\n    *   In the **exo (minor) product**, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C2=C3 double bond. The anhydride protons (H5, H6) are now far from the vinylic methyl groups. Consequently, the NOE cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak.\n    *   This specific NOE is a classic diagnostic tool to determine the stereochemistry of Diels-Alder adducts.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the finding to the given options.**\n    *   The key NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor one is between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n    *   Based on our assignments: this is the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (C7-H and anhydride-H)\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Bridgehead-Me and Vinylic-Me)\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Vinylic-Me and anhydride-H)\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Bridgehead-Me and C7-H)\n\n    *   Option C correctly identifies the pair of resonances connected by the diagnostic NOESY cross-peak.\n\n<<<C>>>"
