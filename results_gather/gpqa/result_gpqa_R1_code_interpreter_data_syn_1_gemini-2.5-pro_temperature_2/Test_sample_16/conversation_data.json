    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical equilibrium.**\n    The problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for the Ca-EDTA complex. The reaction for the formation is:\n    Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- <=> [Ca(EDTA)]^2-\n\n    The question asks for the concentration of free calcium ions in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the complex, [Ca(EDTA)]^2-. This means we need to consider the dissociation of the complex back into its constituent ions. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    [Ca(EDTA)]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n\n2.  **Define the equilibrium constant.**\n    The equilibrium constant for the formation reaction is given as K_f = 5.0 x 10^10.\n    K_f = [Ca(EDTA)]^2- / ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-])\n\n    Since we are considering the dissociation reaction, it's convenient to work with the dissociation constant, K_d, which is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5.0 x 10^10) = 2.0 x 10^-11.\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium.\n    The reaction is: [Ca(EDTA)]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n\n    |               | [Ca(EDTA)]^2- | [Ca^2+] | [EDTA^4-] |\n    |---------------|---------------|---------|-----------|\n    | Initial (I)   | 0.02 M        | 0 M     | 0 M       |\n    | Change (C)    | -x            | +x      | +x        |\n    | Equilibrium(E)| 0.02 - x      | x       | x         |\n\n    At equilibrium:\n    [Ca^2+] = x\n    [EDTA^4-] = x\n    [[Ca(EDTA)]^2-] = 0.02 - x\n\n4.  **Use the equilibrium expression to solve for x.**\n    The equilibrium expression for the dissociation is:\n    K_d = ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-]) / [Ca(EDTA)]^2-\n\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n    2.0 x 10^-11 = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2.0 x 10^-11 = x^2 / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Apply a simplifying assumption.**\n    Because the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the dissociation constant (K_d) is very small. This indicates that the complex is very stable and will not dissociate significantly. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can assume that `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    2.0 x 10^-11 ≈ x^2 / 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate x.**\n    Now, solve for x, which represents the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+].\n    x^2 ≈ (2.0 x 10^-11) * 0.02\n    x^2 ≈ 4.0 x 10^-13\n    x = sqrt(4.0 x 10^-13)\n\n    To get the final value, we can use a calculator or a simple python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5.0e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# The equilibrium expression is K_f = [Complex] / ([Ca] * [EDTA])\n# At equilibrium, [Ca] = [EDTA] = x, and [Complex] = initial_complex_conc - x\n# Since K_f is very large, x is very small, so [Complex] is approximately initial_complex_conc.\n# So, K_f ≈ initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# Rearranging for x^2: x^2 ≈ initial_complex_conc / K_f\n\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\nExecution of the python code provides the following result:\n`6.32e-07`\n\nThis result means that x = 6.32 x 10^-7 M.\n\n7.  **Conclusion.**\n    The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+], is equal to x, which is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M. This value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca^2+]) in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Chemical Equation**: The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is the relevant equilibrium:\n    [Ca(EDTA)]^2-  <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant**: The problem gives the formation constant, K_f (also denoted as K_Ca-EDTA) = 5.0 x 10^10. The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5.0 x 10^10) = 2.0 x 10^-11\n\n3.  **ICE Table Setup**: We set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of [Ca(EDTA)]^2- that dissociates.\n\n    | Species         | [Ca(EDTA)]^2- | Ca^2+ | EDTA^4- |\n    |-----------------|---------------|-------|---------|\n    | Initial (I)     | 0.02 M        | 0 M   | 0 M     |\n    | Change (C)      | -x            | +x    | +x      |\n    | Equilibrium (E) | 0.02 - x      | x     | x       |\n\n4.  **Equilibrium Expression**: We write the expression for the dissociation constant, K_d:\n    K_d = ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-]) / [Ca(EDTA)]^2-\n\n5.  **Solving for x**: Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression:\n    2.0 x 10^-11 = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2.0 x 10^-11 = x^2 / (0.02 - x)\n\n    Since K_d is very small, the amount of complex that dissociates (x) will be negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). We can make the approximation that `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`.\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    2.0 x 10^-11 ≈ x^2 / 0.02\n\n    Now, we solve for x, which represents the concentration of Ca^2+ ions:\n    x^2 ≈ (2.0 x 10^-11) * 0.02\n    x^2 ≈ 4.0 x 10^-13\n    x = sqrt(4.0 x 10^-13)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M, which corresponds to option D. The Python code output confirmed this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
