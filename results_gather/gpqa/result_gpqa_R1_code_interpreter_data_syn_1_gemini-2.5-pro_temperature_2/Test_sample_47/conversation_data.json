    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the chemical synthesis problem.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone (a 6-membered ring with a C=O group).\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The bromine atom substitutes a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heat.\n*   **Reaction:** An α-haloketone with an available proton on the other alpha-carbon (α'-position) undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement when treated with a strong base. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   *Alternative consideration:* An E2 elimination could form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the subsequent reaction with thionyl chloride (Step 3) is characteristic for carboxylic acids, not enones, making the Favorskii rearrangement the intended pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid (-COOH) into an acid chloride (-COCl).\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to alcohols.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Final Question: How many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4?**\n\nTo answer this, we need to analyze the structure of Product 4, which is **Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**, and determine the number of non-equivalent hydrogen environments, which corresponds to the number of signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** A cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The total chemical formula is C₆H₁₀O.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation). This results in a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry (a Cₛ plane). This plane passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\nLet's identify the sets of chemically equivalent protons based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. That's **1** distinct type.\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the proton on the carbon atom of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group. It is a unique methine proton. That's a **2nd** distinct type.\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 itself (and C5) are diastereotopic. This means they are not equivalent to each other because C2 is adjacent to the prochiral center C1. One proton is, on average, cis-like to the CHO group, and the other is trans-like. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 form two distinct sets. That's **2 more** distinct types.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the case above, the two protons on C3 (and C4) are diastereotopic. The four protons on C3 and C4 also form two distinct sets. That's **another 2** distinct types.\n\n**Tally of distinct hydrogen types:**\n*   H(aldehyde): 1 type\n*   H(on C1): 1 type\n*   H(on C2/C5): 2 types\n*   H(on C3/C4): 2 types\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe code block below confirms the logical deduction by stating the conclusion from established chemical principles.\n```python\n# The final product is Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n# To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we analyze the molecule's symmetry for a 1H NMR spectrum.\n#\n# The molecule (C5H9-CHO) contains:\n# 1. An aldehyde proton (-CHO). This is unique. (1 type)\n# 2. A proton on the carbon where the aldehyde is attached (C1). This methine proton is unique. (1 type)\n# 3. Protons on the carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5). Due to time-averaged symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent.\n#    However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic, meaning they are non-equivalent.\n#    This gives two sets of signals for the four protons on C2/C5. (2 types)\n# 4. Protons on the carbons beta to C1 (C3 and C4). Due to symmetry, C3 and C4 are equivalent.\n#    Again, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic and non-equivalent.\n#    This gives two sets of signals for the four protons on C3/C4. (2 types)\n#\n# Total distinct types = 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H) + 2 (C3/C4-H) = 6.\n#\nprint(6)\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",

    "The user's query asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product of a four-step chemical synthesis.
