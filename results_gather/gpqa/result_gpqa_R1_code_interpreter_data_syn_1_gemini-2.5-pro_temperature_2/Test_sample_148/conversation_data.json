    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Key Observations:**\n    *   **Molecule:** A small synthetic peptide. Peptides are made of amino acids, which are typically chiral (except glycine).\n    *   **¹H NMR Data:**\n        *   Two distinct peaks are observed for a *single proton* (an alpha-proton).\n        *   The chemical shifts are similar.\n        *   The integrals of the two peaks are roughly equal (1:1 ratio), and their sum is correct (1H).\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is not the cause. This is important as it rules out simple J-coupling splitting.\n    *   **LC-MS Data:**\n        *   LC (Liquid Chromatography) shows two separate peaks. This means there are two different compounds that can be physically separated.\n        *   The separation was done at \"elevated temperature.\"\n        *   MS (Mass Spectrometry) for *both* peaks shows the same mass, and this mass is consistent with the expected product molecule.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Implications of the Data:**\n    *   The MS data is crucial. The fact that both peaks have the *same mass* means we are dealing with **isomers**—molecules with the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms.\n    *   The NMR and LC data are also crucial. The fact that there are two distinct peaks in both NMR (for a single proton) and LC indicates that the two isomers are **distinguishable** by these techniques. They have different chemical environments (affecting NMR shift) and different physical properties (affecting LC retention time).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Provided Options Based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They occur in molecules with two or more chiral centers.\n        *   **Properties:** Diastereomers are different chemical compounds. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **Compatibility with Data:**\n            *   **NMR:** Because they are different compounds, the chemical environment of a given proton (like the alpha-proton) will be different in each diastereomer. This would result in two different peaks, consistent with the observation.\n            *   **LC:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. This would result in two LC peaks, consistent with the observation.\n            *   **MS:** Because they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and therefore the same mass. This is consistent with the observation.\n        *   **Plausibility in Synthesis:** In peptide synthesis, if one of the amino acid starting materials is not enantiomerically pure, or if epimerization (racemization at one chiral center) occurs during the coupling reaction (a common side reaction), a mixture of diastereomers will be formed. A 1:1 ratio is common if full epimerization occurs at one center. This option fits all the data perfectly.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   **Definition:** This implies a side product where an extra amino acid unit has been added. For example, forming A-B-B instead of the target A-B.\n        *   **Compatibility with Data:** The product A-B-B would have a significantly different (higher) mass than the target A-B. The MS data clearly shows both peaks have the *same* mass as the expected molecule. This option is definitively incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror-image stereoisomers.\n        *   **Properties:** Enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment.\n        *   **Compatibility with Data:**\n            *   **NMR:** In a standard, achiral NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce identical spectra. You would see only one set of peaks, not two.\n            *   **LC:** On a standard, achiral LC column, enantiomers co-elute (do not separate). You would see only one peak, not two.\n        *   Since both NMR and standard LC show two peaks, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   **Definition:** A starting material or an intermediate from the synthesis is present in the final mixture.\n        *   **Compatibility with Data:** A precursor is a different molecule and would almost certainly have a different molecular weight than the final product. The MS data shows both peaks have the *same* mass as the final product. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Option A is the only explanation that accounts for all the experimental observations. A mixture of diastereomers consists of two distinct compounds that are isomers. As isomers, they have the same mass (consistent with MS). As distinct compounds, they have different physical properties and can be separated by LC, and they have different chemical environments internally, leading to different NMR spectra. The phenomenon is common in peptide chemistry due to potential epimerization during synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>"
