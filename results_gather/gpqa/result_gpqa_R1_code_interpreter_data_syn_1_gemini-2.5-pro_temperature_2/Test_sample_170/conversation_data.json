    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Goal**\nThe reaction is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) of various monosubstituted benzenes with bromine (Br₂). The goal is to arrange these substances in order of *increasing* yield of the *para*-monobromo product. The weight fraction of the yield is directly proportional to the molar percentage of the para-isomer formed, so we need to rank the compounds by the percentage of para-substitution.\n\n**2. Classify Substituents based on Directing Effects**\nSubstituents on a benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions. We can classify the given substituents into two groups:\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. Compounds with these substituents will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but directs ortho, para.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. Compounds with these substituents will produce very little of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating group.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Moderately deactivating group.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Moderately deactivating group.\n\nFrom this classification, we know that the three meta-directing compounds (2, 4, 6) will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will come first in the ranking, while the three ortho, para-directing compounds (1, 3, 5) will have the highest yields and will come last.\n\n**3. Rank the Meta-Directing Compounds (Lowest Para-Yields)**\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low. The order is determined by the electron-withdrawing strength (deactivating strength) of the group. A stronger deactivating group repels the electrophile more strongly from the ortho and para positions, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**\n    *   The **-NO₂** group (4) is one of the most powerful electron-withdrawing groups, so it will have the *lowest* para-yield.\n    *   The **-COOH** group (6) is less deactivating than -NO₂.\n    *   The **-COOC₂H₅** group (2) is slightly less deactivating than -COOH because the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is weakly electron-donating, which slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing nature of the substituent compared to the acidic proton in -COOH.\n*   Therefore, the order of *increasing* para-yield for this group is the reverse of their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Rank the Ortho, Para-Directing Compounds (Highest Para-Yields)**\nFor these compounds, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is primarily influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is larger and more sterically bulky than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance around the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Thus, ethylbenzene yields a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chlorine atom in chlorobenzene is an ortho, para-director due to its lone pairs participating in resonance, but it's deactivating due to its strong inductive electron withdrawal. This strong inductive effect deactivates the ortho positions more significantly than the para position. This electronic factor, combined with the steric size of chlorine, leads to a very high preference for substitution at the para position. The percentage of para-bromochlorobenzene is significantly higher than that of para-bromotoluene or para-bromoethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene (3) will have the highest yield of the para-isomer in this group.\n\n*   The final order of *increasing* para-yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Combine the Rankings**\nBy combining the rankings of the two groups, we get the final order for all six substances:\n\n(Lowest para-yields) < (Highest para-yields)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
