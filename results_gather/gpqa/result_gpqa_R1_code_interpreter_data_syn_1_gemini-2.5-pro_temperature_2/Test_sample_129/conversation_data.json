    "Here's the reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The question is about the cosmological redshift of light. As the universe expands, light from distant objects gets stretched to longer wavelengths. The relationship between the wavelength of light emitted by the source (rest wavelength, `λ_rest`) and the wavelength we observe on Earth (`λ_obs`) is given by the redshift `z`:\n    `λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z)`\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Values:**\n    *   **The Spectral Line:** The problem specifies the Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) line of neutral hydrogen. This is the transition of an electron from the n=2 to the n=1 energy level. Its rest wavelength is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum.\n    *   **Rest Wavelength (`λ_rest`)**: `λ_rest` for Ly-α is approximately 1216 Å (or 121.6 nm). A more precise value is 1215.67 Å.\n\n3.  **Identify the Observational Constraint:**\n    *   **Telescope Type:** The detection is done with a \"ground-based optical telescope.\"\n    *   **The Constraint:** The Earth's atmosphere is a crucial filter. It is largely transparent to visible light (the \"optical window\") but is opaque to most ultraviolet (UV) and infrared radiation. The atmosphere absorbs nearly all light with wavelengths shorter than about 3200 Å (320 nm) due to ozone and other molecules.\n    *   **Conclusion:** For the Ly-α line to be detected from the ground, its wavelength must be redshifted from 1216 Å past the atmospheric cutoff and into the visible spectrum. We need `λ_obs` to be greater than approximately 3200 Å.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    *   We want to find the *lower limit* on the redshift `z`. This corresponds to the redshift needed to shift the Ly-α line to the *minimum* observable wavelength, which is the atmospheric cutoff.\n    *   Set `λ_rest` = 1216 Å\n    *   Set `λ_obs` = 3200 Å (as the minimum observable wavelength)\n    *   Rearrange the redshift formula to solve for `z`:\n        `1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest`\n        `z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1`\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   This is where the provided code comes in. It calculates the precise value of `z`.\n    *   `z = (3200 Å / 1215.67 Å) - 1`\n    *   From the code output, `z ≈ 1.63`\n\n6.  **Analyze the Result and Select the Answer:**\n    *   The calculated absolute minimum redshift is `z ≈ 1.63`. Any object with a redshift lower than this will have its Ly-α line blocked by the atmosphere.\n    *   Now we compare this value to the given options:\n        A) 1.2\n        B) 3\n        C) 2.4\n        D) 1.9\n    *   The value `z=1.2` is too low.\n    *   The values `z=3` and `z=2.4` are high enough to be detected, but they are not the *lower limit*.\n    *   The value `z=1.9` is the smallest option that is clearly above our calculated threshold of 1.63. The atmospheric cutoff isn't a perfectly sharp line, and using a slightly more conservative cutoff (e.g., 3500 Å, which is reasonable for many observatory sites) yields a redshift of `z = (3500/1216) - 1 ≈ 1.88`. This makes `z=1.9` an excellent answer. It represents the lowest redshift among the choices that is guaranteed to be observable from the ground.\n\n<<<D>>>"
