    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental results to determine the composition of the gaseous mixture.**\n\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B is heated, decomposing completely into a mixture of gases. This gaseous mixture is passed through three tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The mass of the tube did not change, which means no such gases were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g, and CuO was formed. This indicates that an oxidizing gas reacted with the copper. The mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms binding to the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could come from O₂ gas (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO) or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O (Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂). Regardless of the source molecule, a total of 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms reacted.\n\n*   **Final Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a single gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C must be inert since it did not react in any of the tubes. Given that the original salts contained nitrogen (as we will see), the most plausible identity for Gas C is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nThe original 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B decomposed into H₂O, the oxygen source for tube 3, and Gas C (N₂). By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass and elemental composition of the products must equal that of the reactants.\n\nLet's find the total moles of each element (H, N, O) in the products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the species that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (0.20 mol H₂O × 1) + 0.05 mol O (from tube 3) = 0.25 mol O.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming Gas C is N₂, and that the reaction in tube 3 didn't change the amount of final N₂ (we'll check this), all nitrogen ends up as N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 0.10 mol N₂ × (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N.\n\n*(Self-check: What if the gas in tube 3 was N₂O? If so, 0.05 mol N₂O would have reacted, producing 0.05 mol N₂. This means the final 0.10 mol of gas C would consist of 0.05 mol N₂ from the initial decomposition plus 0.05 mol N₂ from the N₂O reaction. In this scenario, the total nitrogen atoms are still 0.10 mol N₂ * 2 = 0.20 mol N. So the result is the same.)*\n\nNow, let's calculate the total mass of these elements to verify it against the initial mass.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass = 0.40 + 4.00 + 2.80 = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming our analysis of the products.\n\n**Step 3: Deduce the formulas of salts A and B.**\n\nThe entire 7.20 g sample contained 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. The problem states this sample was an equimolar mixture of A and B. Let's find the elemental ratio for the combination of one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   Ratio of moles: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n*   To get small integers, we can multiply all numbers by 20:\n    *   N: 0.20 × 20 = 4\n    *   H: 0.40 × 20 = 8\n    *   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n*   So, the combined empirical formula for (A + B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nSince A and B are salts containing N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. The ammonium cation is NH₄⁺.\n*   The combined formula N₄H₈O₅ has 8 hydrogen atoms, which corresponds exactly to two ammonium cations: (NH₄⁺)₂.\n*   If we take out (NH₄)₂ (which is N₂H₈) from N₄H₈O₅, the remaining part is N₂O₅.\n*   So, the two anions must sum to N₂O₅²⁻. The common oxyanions of nitrogen are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n*   Let's check their sum: NO₂⁻ + NO₃⁻ = N₂O₅²⁻. This fits perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   Salt A = NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   Salt B = NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   Sum of formulas = (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅. This matches our derived combined formula.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B).\n\n*   Number of atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n*   Number of atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   Total number of atoms = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D."
