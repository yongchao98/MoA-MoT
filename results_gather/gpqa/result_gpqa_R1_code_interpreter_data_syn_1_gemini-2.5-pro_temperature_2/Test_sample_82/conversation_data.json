    "This problem requires calculating the pH at two different points during the titration of a diluted weak acid (acetic acid) with a strong base (NaOH).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nFirst, we calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid solution after being diluted with water.\nThe dilution formula is C1 * V1 = C2 * V2, where:\n*   C1 = Initial concentration of acetic acid = 0.05 M\n*   V1 = Initial volume of acetic acid = 20.00 cm3\n*   V2 = Final volume = 20.00 cm3 (acid) + 20.00 cm3 (water) = 40.00 cm3\n*   C2 = Final concentration of acetic acid\n\nC2 = (C1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm3) / 40.00 cm3 = 0.025 M\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt any point during the titration before the equivalence point, the solution is a buffer containing the weak acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate base (CH3COO-). We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([CH3COO-]/[CH3COOH])\n\nFirst, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10^-5)\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form the acetate ion (CH3COO-), and 75% of the acetic acid remains.\nTherefore, the ratio [CH3COO-]/[CH3COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n\npH = pKa + log(1/3)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The solution contains only the weak base, acetate (CH3COO-), which hydrolyzes in water:\nCH3COO- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH-\n\nTo find the pH, we first need to find the pOH by calculating the concentration of OH-. This requires:\n1.  **Finding the moles of acid:**\n    Moles = Concentration * Volume = 0.025 M * 0.040 L = 0.001 mol of CH3COOH.\n2.  **Finding the volume of NaOH added to reach the equivalence point (V_eq):**\n    Moles of acid = Moles of base => 0.001 mol = 0.1 M * V_eq\n    V_eq = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm3.\n3.  **Finding the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH3COO-]) at the equivalence point:**\n    The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of diluted acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n    V_total = 40.00 cm3 + 10.00 cm3 = 50.00 cm3 = 0.050 L.\n    [CH3COO-] = Moles of acetate / Total volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n4.  **Calculating [OH-] using the Kb for acetate:**\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = 1.0 x 10^-14 / 1.85 x 10^-5\n    Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-] ≈ [OH-]^2 / [CH3COO-]\n    [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [CH3COO-])\n5.  **Calculating pOH and then pH:**\n    pOH = -log([OH-])\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH\n\nTo perform these calculations accurately, a python script is used.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nka = 1.85e-5\nkw = 1.0e-14\nconc_naoh = 0.1 # M\n\n# Step 1: Dilution\nc1_acid = 0.05 # M\nv1_acid = 20.00 # cm3\nv_water = 20.00 # cm3\nv2_acid_diluted = v1_acid + v_water # cm3\nc2_acid_diluted = (c1_acid * v1_acid) / v2_acid_diluted\n\n# Step 2: pH at 25% titration\npka = -math.log10(ka)\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\nph_25 = pka + math.log10(1/3)\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {ph_25:.2f}\")\n\n# Step 3: pH at equivalence point\n# Moles of acid\nmoles_acid = c2_acid_diluted * (v2_acid_diluted / 1000)\n# Volume of NaOH at equivalence point\nv_eq_naoh_L = moles_acid / conc_naoh\nv_eq_naoh_cm3 = v_eq_naoh_L * 1000\n# Total volume at equivalence point\nv_total_eq_L = (v2_acid_diluted + v_eq_naoh_cm3) / 1000\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate)\nconc_a_minus = moles_acid / v_total_eq_L\n# Calculate Kb\nkb = kw / ka\n# Calculate [OH-] from Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-]\nconc_oh = math.sqrt(kb * conc_a_minus)\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npoh = -math.log10(conc_oh)\nph_eq = 14 - poh\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {ph_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n**Code Execution Output:**\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n```\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = 4.26\n*   pH at equivalence point = 8.52\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4.57; 6.92\nB) 3.17; 6.73\nC) 4.73; 7.00\nD) 4.26; 8.52\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem.\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n\nFirst, we determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water. The dilution equation is C₁V₁ = C₂V₂, where:\n*   C₁ is the initial concentration of acetic acid = 0.05 M.\n*   V₁ is the initial volume of acetic acid = 20.00 cm³.\n*   V₂ is the final volume of the solution = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³.\n*   C₂ is the final concentration of the diluted acetic acid.\n\nC₂ = (C₁ × V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n\nSo, we are titrating a 0.025 M solution of acetic acid.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\nAt any point during the titration of a weak acid with a strong base (before the equivalence point), the solution contains a mixture of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), forming a buffer. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pH:\n\npH = pKa + log([CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH])\n\nFirst, we need to find the pKa from the given Ka value:\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the original acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form acetate (CH₃COO⁻), while the remaining 75% is still unreacted acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n[CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n\nNow we can calculate the pH.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO). The solution contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base. The acetate ion hydrolyzes water according to the following reaction:\n\nCH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\nTo find the pH, we need to first calculate the concentration of OH⁻ produced from this hydrolysis.\n\n*   **Moles of acetic acid:**\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.0400 L = 0.001 moles.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH needed for equivalence:**\n    At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n*   **Total volume at equivalence point:**\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n\n*   **Concentration of acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻]:**\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles of acetate / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻] using Kb:**\n    We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be found from Ka and Kw (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C).\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵).\n    The equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis is Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻]/[CH₃COO⁻]. Assuming [CH₃COOH] = [OH⁻] = x, and [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ 0.02 M, we get:\n    Kb ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(Kb × 0.02)\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻])\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH\n\nTo get the precise numerical values, the following Python script will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given constants and initial values ---\nka = 1.85e-5\nkw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_acid_conc = 0.05  # M\ninitial_acid_vol = 20.00 # cm3\nwater_vol = 20.00      # cm3\nnaoh_conc = 0.1          # M\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid ---\n# Final volume after adding water\nfinal_acid_vol = initial_acid_vol + water_vol\n# Calculate the concentration of the acid after dilution (C1V1 = C2V2)\ndiluted_acid_conc = (initial_acid_conc * initial_acid_vol) / final_acid_vol\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# Calculate pKa from Ka\npka = -math.log10(ka)\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3\n# Use Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\nph_at_25_percent = pka + math.log10(1/3)\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {ph_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point ---\n# Moles of the diluted acid\nmoles_of_acid = diluted_acid_conc * (final_acid_vol / 1000) # Convert volume to L\n# Volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence point (moles_acid = moles_base)\nvol_naoh_eq = moles_of_acid / naoh_conc  # Volume in L\n# Total volume of the solution at the equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq = (final_acid_vol / 1000) + vol_naoh_eq # Volume in L\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence\nacetate_conc = moles_of_acid / total_vol_eq\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base from Ka and Kw\nkb = kw / ka\n# Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH-] from the hydrolysis of acetate\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [acetate], so [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [acetate])\nhydroxide_conc = math.sqrt(kb * acetate_conc)\n# Calculate pOH from [OH-]\npoh = -math.log10(hydroxide_conc)\n# Calculate pH from pOH\nph_at_equivalence = 14 - poh\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {ph_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>",
    "Based on the calculations, the results are as follows:\n\n*   **pH at 25% titration:** The solution acts as a buffer. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]). With a Ka of 1.85x10⁻⁵, the pKa is 4.73. At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base [A⁻] to acid [HA] is 25/75 or 1/3.\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25\n    The more precise calculation gives **4.26**.\n\n*   **pH at the equivalence point:** All the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base. After calculating the concentration of acetate at the equivalence point (0.02 M) and its Kb, the resulting hydroxide concentration [OH⁻] is found. This leads to a pOH, and finally a pH.\n    The calculation shows the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values (4.26; 8.52) match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
