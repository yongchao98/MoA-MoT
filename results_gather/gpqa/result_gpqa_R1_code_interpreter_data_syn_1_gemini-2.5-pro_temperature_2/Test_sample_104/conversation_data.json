    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I first need to understand the two scenarios presented and find the key physical quantity that connects them.\n    *   **Scenario 1: The Spotted Star.** A star has one hemisphere covered in dark spots. As it rotates, we see either the clean hemisphere or the spotty hemisphere. This change in the visible surface causes a periodic change in the star's total brightness (flux). The amplitude of this brightness change is the \"signal.\"\n    *   **Scenario 2: The Transiting Exoplanet.** A hypothetical exoplanet passes in front of an un-spotted version of the same star. This transit blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip is the \"signal.\"\n    *   **The Connection:** The problem states that the \"amplitude signal\" from both scenarios is the same. My goal is to quantify this amplitude and use the equivalence to find the exoplanet's relative radius ($R_{pl}/R_{star}$).\n\n2.  **Analyze Scenario 1: The Spotted Star**\n    *   The brightness of a star (or part of a star) is related to its temperature by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the emitted flux ($F$) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature ($T^4$) and the emitting area ($A$): $F \\propto A \\cdot T^4$.\n    *   **Maximum Brightness ($F_{max}$):** This occurs when the clean, un-spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk of the star has a temperature of $T_{eff} = 6000$ K. So, $F_{max} \\propto A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4$, where $A_{disk}$ is the projected area of the star's disk.\n    *   **Minimum Brightness ($F_{min}$):** This occurs when the spotty hemisphere faces the observer. The problem states this hemisphere has a spot \"filling factor\" of $f = 20\\% = 0.2$. This means 20% of the visible area is covered by spots, and the remaining 80% is the normal stellar surface (photosphere).\n        *   The spots have a temperature $T_{spot} = T_{eff} - 1000 K = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K$.\n        *   The flux from the spotty disk is a combination of flux from the normal parts and the cooler, spotty parts.\n        *   Flux from normal part: $\\propto (1-f) \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4$\n        *   Flux from spotty part: $\\propto f \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{spot}^4$\n        *   Total minimum flux: $F_{min} \\propto [(1-f) \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4] + [f \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{spot}^4]$\n    *   **Calculate the Signal Amplitude:** The signal amplitude is the relative drop in flux from maximum to minimum.\n        Amplitude = $\\frac{F_{max} - F_{min}}{F_{max}} = 1 - \\frac{F_{min}}{F_{max}}$\n        Substituting the expressions for flux:\n        Amplitude = $1 - \\frac{[(1-f) \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4] + [f \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{spot}^4]}{A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4}$\n        The $A_{disk}$ term cancels out.\n        Amplitude = $1 - \\left[ (1-f) + f \\cdot \\frac{T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4} \\right]$\n        Amplitude = $1 - (1-f) - f \\cdot (\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}})^4$\n        Amplitude = $f - f \\cdot (\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}})^4 = f \\cdot \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4\\right]$\n    *   **Plug in the numbers:**\n        *   $f = 0.2$\n        *   $T_{spot} = 5000$ K\n        *   $T_{eff} = 6000$ K\n        *   $\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}} = \\frac{5000}{6000} = \\frac{5}{6}$\n        *   Amplitude = $0.2 \\cdot \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^4\\right]$\n\n3.  **Analyze Scenario 2: The Transiting Exoplanet**\n    *   When an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a circular area of light.\n    *   The signal amplitude (or transit depth) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   Area of the planet's disk: $A_{pl} = \\pi R_{pl}^2$\n    *   Area of the star's disk: $A_{star} = \\pi R_{star}^2$\n    *   Amplitude = $\\frac{A_{pl}}{A_{star}} = \\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the two scenarios and Solve**\n    *   Now, I set the amplitude from the spotted star equal to the amplitude from the transiting planet:\n        $\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = f \\cdot \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4\\right]$\n    *   The final step is to solve for $\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}$ by plugging in the numbers and taking the square root. I will use a Python script to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the given parameters\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\ndelta_T = 1000.0 # Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin\nT_spot = T_eff - delta_T # Temperature of the spots\nf = 0.20 # Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots.\n# The relative flux drop is Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)\nflux_drop_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The brightness dip due to a transiting exoplanet is given by:\n# Amplitude = (R_planet / R_star)^2\n# We are given that the amplitudes are equal.\n# (R_pl / R_star)^2 = flux_drop_spots\n\n# Solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star)\nrelative_radius = np.sqrt(flux_drop_spots)\n\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n\n>>>\n0.3217912061245028\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.3218.\n\n5.  **Final Comparison:**\n    *   The calculated value is $R_{pl}/R_{star} \\approx 0.3218$.\n    *   I will compare this to the given options:\n        *   A) ~0.32\n        *   B) ~0.39\n        *   C) ~0.07\n        *   D) ~0.11\n    *   The calculated value is extremely close to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to equate the amplitude of the brightness drop caused by the starspots with the amplitude of the brightness drop caused by a transiting exoplanet.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the brightness drop due to the spotted hemisphere.**\n\nThe flux (brightness) of a star is proportional to the emitting area ($A$) and the fourth power of its effective temperature ($T$), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law ($F \\propto A \\cdot T^4$).\n\n*   When the un-spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is maximum ($F_{max}$).
