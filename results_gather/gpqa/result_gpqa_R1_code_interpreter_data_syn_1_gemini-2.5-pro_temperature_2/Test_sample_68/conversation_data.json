    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution ($L_{min}$) needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. The \"resolution\" in this context refers to the minimum track length of the particle $X^0$ that the detector (Bubble Chamber) must be able to measure. A decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than or equal to this minimum resolution before it decays.\n\n**2. Relativistic Decay Kinematics:**\nA particle moving at relativistic speeds experiences time dilation. Its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by a factor of $\\gamma$, the Lorentz factor.\n*   Lab lifetime: $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\nThe average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is called the mean decay length ($\\lambda$).\n*   Mean decay length: $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity in the lab frame.\n\n**3. Exponential Decay Law:**\nThe decay of particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The fraction of particles that survive after traveling a distance $x$ is given by:\n*   Fraction surviving past $x$: $P(L > x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$\n\nWe need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the fraction of particles that travel a distance of at least $L_{min}$ must be 30% (or 0.3).\n*   Condition: $e^{-L_{min}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nSolving for $L_{min}$:\n$ -L_{min}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30) $\n$ L_{min} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) $\n\n**4. Calculation of Parameters:**\n\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    The total energy $E$ of a particle is related to its rest mass $m$ and Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ by $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n    Given $E = 27$ GeV and $m c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{mc^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41}$\n\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    We can express $\\lambda$ as $\\lambda = v \\tau = v (\\gamma \\tau_0) = (v/c) \\gamma c \\tau_0 = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau_0$.\n    The term $\\beta\\gamma$ can be found from the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$\n    Also, $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$. So, $pc = \\beta \\gamma mc^2$.\n    Therefore, $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$.\n    The mean decay length is:\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation:**\nNow, we will substitute the given values into the formulas. We can use a Python script for precision.\n\n*   $E = 27$ GeV\n*   $mc^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   Observation percentage = 0.30\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem\nE_GeV = 27.0\nmc2_GeV = 3.41\ntau0_s = 8.0e-16\nc_m_s = 299792458\npercentage = 0.30\n\n# Calculate pc in GeV from the relativistic energy-momentum relation E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2\npc_GeV = math.sqrt(E_GeV**2 - mc2_GeV**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in the lab frame.\n# lambda = (pc / mc^2) * c * tau0\nmean_decay_length_m = (pc_GeV / mc2_GeV) * c_m_s * tau0_s\n\n# Calculate the minimum resolution L_min.\n# P(L > L_min) = exp(-L_min / lambda) = 0.30\n# L_min = -lambda * ln(0.30)\nmin_resolution_m = -mean_decay_length_m * math.log(percentage)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation with three significant figures.\nprint(f\"{min_resolution_m:.3e}\")\n```\n>>>\n2.268e-06\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\nThe calculated minimum resolution is approximately $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 2.08 x 10⁻¹ m\nB) 2.08 x 10⁻⁹ m\nC) 2.08 x 10⁻³ m\nD) 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\nThe calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is closest to option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The small discrepancy (about 9%) is likely due to a slight inconsistency in the numbers provided in the problem statement versus the options, but option D is the only one with the correct order of magnitude and the closest value.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem requires us to find the minimum track length ($L_{min}$) that a detector must be able to resolve to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation:**\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a probabilistic process described by an exponential decay law. The fraction of particles that survive (i.e., do not decay) after traveling a distance $L$ is given by:\n    $N(L)/N_0 = e^{-L/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Condition for Observation:** The problem states that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means that the particle must travel a distance of at least $L_{min}$ before decaying. In other words, the fraction of particles that survive to travel a distance $L_{min}$ must be 30% (or 0.3).\n    $e^{-L_{min}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\n3.  **Solving for Minimum Resolution ($L_{min}$):**\n    We can solve the above equation for $L_{min}$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-L_{min}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $L_{min} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n4.  **Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    The mean decay length in the lab frame depends on the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) and its relativistic velocity. It is given by:\n    $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$\n    where $\\tau$ is the lifetime in the lab frame and $v$ is the velocity.\n\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    *   **Relativistic Momentum:** The mean decay length can also be expressed in terms of momentum ($p$) and mass ($m$):\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m} \\tau_0$\n\n5.  **Calculating Relativistic Quantities:**\n    We are given the total energy $E = 27$ GeV and the rest mass energy $mc^2 = 3.41$ GeV. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\n    We can solve for the momentum term, $pc$:\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now we can calculate the mean decay length, $\\lambda$. We can rewrite the expression $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m}\\tau_0$ as $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} c \\tau_0$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n        $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n    Finally, we calculate the minimum resolution $L_{min}$:\n    *   $L_{min} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n        $L_{min} \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n        $L_{min} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThe calculated value $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is very close to the value given in option D.\n\nThe provided python code executed this calculation with high precision:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem\nE_GeV = 27.0\nmc2_GeV = 3.41\ntau0_s = 8.0e-16\nc_m_s = 299792458\npercentage = 0.30\n\n# Calculate pc in GeV\npc_GeV = math.sqrt(E_GeV**2 - mc2_GeV**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length (lambda)\nmean_decay_length_m = (pc_GeV / mc2_GeV) * c_m_s * tau0_s\n\n# Calculate the minimum resolution L_min\nmin_resolution_m = -mean_decay_length_m * math.log(percentage)\n\n# Output from code execution: 2.268e-06\n```\nThe result is $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) with the given options:\nA) 2.08 x 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 x 1e-9 m\nC) 2.08 x 1e-3 m\nD) 2.08 x 1e-6 m\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
