    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given chemical reactions to identify the unknown compounds.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4: D(gas) + B(gas) -> H (solvent) (1:1 ratio)**\n    This describes the formation of a solvent from two gases in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. A very common example of such a reaction is the synthesis of 1,2-dichloroethane from ethene and chlorine, both of which are gases.\n    C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)\n    1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂) is widely used as a solvent. Let's hypothesize:\n    *   **B = Cl₂ (chlorine)**\n    *   **D = C₂H₄ (ethene/ethylene)**\n    *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**\n    Another possibility is CO(g) + Cl₂(g) -> COCl₂(g/l) (phosgene), but we will see that the first hypothesis is more consistent.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: C + H₂O -> A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)**\n    This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   If B is Cl₂, then C must be a chloride compound. Its hydrolysis produces hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is a strong acid. So, **F = HCl**.\n    *   The reaction also reforms the solid A and produces a weak acid G. The regeneration of A from a hydrolysis reaction that also produces an acid from the same element suggests a disproportionation reaction. Let's consider sulfur chemistry. The hydrolysis of sulfur chlorides fits this pattern. Specifically, sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) hydrolyzes as follows:\n        2SCl₂(l) + 2H₂O(l) → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)\n    *   In this reaction:\n        *   Solid elemental sulfur (A) is reformed. The common solid allotrope of sulfur is S₈.\n        *   HCl (F), a strong acid, is produced.\n        *   Sulfur dioxide (SO₂) is produced, which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid. So, **G = H₂SO₃**.\n    *   This strongly supports the idea that **A = S₈ (sulfur)** and **C = SCl₂ (sulfur dichloride)**.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.**\n    Let's check if this is consistent with our assignments.\n    *   A = S₈, B = Cl₂\n    *   The reaction is: S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)\n    *   This reaction shows that 1 mole of S₈ molecules reacts with 8 moles of Cl₂ gas. So, the stoichiometry \"1 equivalent of A to 8 equivalents of B\" is correct.\n    *   The product, SCl₂, is described as a cherry-red liquid, which fits the description \"bright red product C\".\n\n*   **Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.**\n    Let's verify this with our assigned compounds.\n    *   C = SCl₂, D = C₂H₄\n    *   The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E\n    *   This is a known industrial process (the Levinstein process) to synthesize bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide:\n        SCl₂ + 2CH₂=CH₂ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂\n    *   The product, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**, is commonly known as **mustard gas**. Mustard gas is a notorious chemical warfare agent and is extremely hazardous, which perfectly matches the description.\n\nAll deductions are consistent. The identities of the compounds are:\n*   A = S₈ (Sulfur)\n*   B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n*   C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n*   D = C₂H₄ (Ethene)\n*   E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard gas)\n*   F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n*   G = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)\n*   H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E (Mustard Gas).**\n\n*   The molecule is **E = bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**. Its structure is a central sulfur atom bonded to two identical -CH₂CH₂Cl chains.\n*   Due to the two lone pairs of electrons on the sulfur atom, the geometry around sulfur is bent, similar to water or dimethyl ether.\n*   The molecule has significant conformational flexibility due to free rotation around the C-S and C-C single bonds. We determine the point group for the most stable or most symmetrical conformation.\n*   The molecule is not planar and not linear.\n*   A plausible high-symmetry conformation possesses a **C₂ rotational axis**. This axis passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation about this axis interchanges the two -CH₂CH₂Cl groups. Experimental data from gas-phase electron diffraction and computational models confirm that the lowest-energy conformation of mustard gas has C₂ symmetry.\n*   In this C₂ conformation, there are no other symmetry elements present besides the identity element (E).\n    *   There is no center of inversion (i).\n    *   There are no mirror planes (σ). A plane containing the C₂ axis (σv) or perpendicular to it (σh) would require specific arrangements of the atoms that are not present.\n*   Since the only symmetry elements are E and C₂, the molecular symmetry group (point group) is **C₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the result with the given options.**\n\nThe options are:\nA) C₂\nB) D₄h\nC) D∞h\nD) C₂v\n\nOur derived point group is C₂, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
