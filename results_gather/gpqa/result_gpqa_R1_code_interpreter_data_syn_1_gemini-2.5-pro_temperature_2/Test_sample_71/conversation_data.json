    "This is a multi-step synthesis problem that requires identifying the structure of the final product and determining its number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. Let's break down the reaction sequence step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, and sodium iodide (NaI).\n*   **Analysis:** The reagent `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` reacting with NaI is likely intended to generate a reactive diene for a Diels-Alder reaction. While the name is unusual and might be a typo for a more common precursor like `1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene`, the function is almost certainly to generate **o-quinodimethane** (*o*-xylylene, OQM). OQM is a highly reactive diene used in Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   **Reaction:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene has two double bonds and can act as a dienophile. Since two equivalents of the OQM precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs. One molecule of OQM adds to the C2=C3 double bond, and a second molecule adds to the C5=C6 double bond.\n*   **Product 1:** The result is a large, polycyclic molecule where the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton is fused to two benzo-annelated six-membered rings.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, H₂O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard condition for the cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) at the C7 position is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The core carbon skeleton of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 2:** The alcohol corresponding to the ether, Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reagents:** SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild oxidation that converts primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The secondary alcohol at C7 in Product 2 is oxidized to a ketone (C=O).\n*   **Product 3:** A polycyclic ketone. The C7 bridge of the original norbornane skeleton is now a carbonyl group.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Condition:** Heating at 150°C.\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3, which contains a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadienone core structure, is thermally unstable. Heating induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. This reaction is the reverse of the initial cycloaddition. The molecule fragments, releasing the two molecules of OQM that were added in Step 1.\n    This process leaves behind bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one. This intermediate is known to be extremely unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination (a type of pericyclic reaction), extruding carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.\n*   **Intermediates formed:** Benzene, CO, and two molecules of OQM.\n*   **Final Product (4):** The question asks for information about the \"final product 4\". Benzene is a final product, but it only has 1 type of hydrogen, which is not an option. The OQM molecules are too reactive to be the final isolated product. They will react further. The most common fate of OQM is rapid dimerization via a [4+2] cycloaddition with another molecule of OQM. This dimerization yields a stable molecule, **5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraene**. It is reasonable to assume this stable dimer is the \"final product 4\" the question refers to.\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is 5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraene. It consists of two benzene rings fused to a central eight-membered ring. The eight-membered ring adopts a non-planar, chair-like conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry. The axis passes through the midpoints of the C5-C6 and C11-C12 bonds. This C₂ operation interchanges the two benzene rings and the two saturated `(-CH₂-CH₂-)` bridges.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogens (i.e., protons in unique chemical environments), we only need to consider one half of the molecule due to the C₂ symmetry. Let's analyze one benzene ring and one adjacent bridge.\n    1.  **Aromatic Hydrogens:** One of the benzene rings is 1,2-disubstituted by the aliphatic bridges. Within this ring, there are no symmetry elements that would make any of the four protons equivalent. Therefore, all four aromatic protons on one ring are chemically distinct.\n    2.  **Aliphatic Hydrogens:** One of the bridges consists of a -CH₂-CH₂- unit. The four protons on this bridge are also all in chemically distinct environments. The protons on each carbon are diastereotopic (e.g., axial-like vs. equatorial-like in the ring), and their positions relative to the rest of the molecule are different. Thus, there are four distinct aliphatic protons.\n\n*   **Total:** The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is the sum of the distinct aromatic and aliphatic protons: 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = 8.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
