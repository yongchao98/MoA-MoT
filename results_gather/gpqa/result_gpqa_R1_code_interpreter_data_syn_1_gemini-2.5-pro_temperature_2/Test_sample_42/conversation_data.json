    "This problem requires a systematic approach to determine the IUPAC name of a complex substituted benzene molecule. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the description and draw the molecule\n\nFirst, we'll break down the description to place each substituent on the benzene ring. It's best to start by placing the highest priority functional group, which is the carboxylic acid, at position 1 (C1).\n\n*   **Parent structure**: A benzene ring with a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This makes the parent molecule **benzoic acid**. We'll place the -COOH group at **C1**.\n*   **\"A carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN) all meta to one another.\"**: \"Meta\" means a 1,3 relationship. If -COOH is at C1, the other two groups must be at C3 and C5. So, we have {-CHO, -CN} at positions {C3, C5}.\n*   **\"Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (-OCH3).\"**: The \"para\" position (1,4 relationship) relative to C1 is C4. So, the -OCH3 group is at **C4**.\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethyl amino (-N(CH3)2).\"**: The \"ortho\" positions (1,2 relationship) relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, we have {-OH, -N(CH3)2} at positions {C2, C6}.\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**: This is the key constraint to finalize the structure. The methoxy group is at C4. The nitrile (-CN) must be ortho (1,2 relationship) to C4. The ortho positions to C4 are C3 and C5. The alcohol (-OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n1.  **Case 1: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The constraint says methoxy (-OCH3) and hydroxyl (-OH) must be at these positions. We already know -OCH3 is at C4. This forces the -OH group to be at **C2**. This fits perfectly.\n2.  **Case 2: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. This would require the -OH group to be at **C6**.\n\nLet's place the remaining groups based on Case 2, as it uses positions farther apart which is often the source of test questions. If -CN is at C5, then -CHO must be at C3. If -OH is at C6, then -N(CH3)2 must be at C2.\n\nLet's assemble the structure based on Case 2 (it turns out both cases describe the same molecule, just reflected):\n*   **C1**: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n*   **C2**: -N(CH3)2 (Dimethyl amino)\n*   **C3**: -CHO (Carbaldehyde/Formyl)\n*   **C4**: -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n*   **C5**: -CN (Cyano/Nitrile)\n*   **C6**: -OH (Hydroxyl)\n\nThis structure satisfies all the conditions given in the description.\n\n### 2. Determine the correct IUPAC numbering\n\nThe IUPAC rules for numbering a substituted benzene ring are as follows:\n1.  The carbon atom bearing the principal functional group is assigned C1. Here, -COOH is the highest priority group, so it is at C1.\n2.  Number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n3.  If a choice remains, give the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's determine the names of the substituent groups and alphabetize them:\n*   Cyano\n*   Dimethylamino\n*   Formyl\n*   Hydroxy\n*   Methoxy\n\nNow let's check the two possible numbering directions from C1:\n\n*   **Clockwise numbering:**\n    *   C2: -N(CH3)2\n    *   C3: -CHO\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CN\n    *   C6: -OH\n    *   The set of locants is **{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}**.\n\n*   **Counter-clockwise numbering:**\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2\n    *   The set of locants is **{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}**.\n\nSince both numbering directions yield the same set of locants {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we must use the alphabetical order tie-breaker rule. We give the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\nThe first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**.\n*   In the clockwise numbering, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n*   In the counter-clockwise numbering, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the **counter-clockwise numbering is the correct one**.\n\n### 3. Assemble the final IUPAC name\n\nUsing the correct counter-clockwise numbering, the locants for each substituent are:\n*   **cyano**: 3\n*   **dimethylamino**: 6 (parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n*   **formyl**: 5\n*   **hydroxy**: 2\n*   **methoxy**: 4\n\nNow, we arrange these substituents alphabetically to form the prefix of the name:\n`3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy`\n\nFinally, we add the parent name, `benzoic acid`.\n\nThe full IUPAC name is:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis matches option C. To double-check, we can use a simple python script to sort and assemble the name.\n```python\nsubstituents = {\n    'cyano': 3,\n    'dimethylamino': 6,\n    'formyl': 5,\n    'hydroxy': 2,\n    'methoxy': 4\n}\n\n# Get substituent names and sort them alphabetically\nsorted_names = sorted(substituents.keys())\n\n# Build the prefix string parts\nprefix_parts = []\nfor name in sorted_names:\n    locant = substituents[name]\n    # Add parentheses for complex substituents like 'dimethylamino'\n    display_name = f\"({name})\" if name == 'dimethylamino' else name\n    prefix_parts.append(f\"{locant}-{display_name}\")\n\n# Join the parts and add the parent name\nprefix = \"-\".join(prefix_parts)\nfull_name = f\"{prefix}benzoic acid\"\n\nprint(full_name)\n```\n```output\n3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n```\nThe code confirms our manually derived name. Comparing our result to the given options:\nA) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering and alphabetization.\nB) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Not alphabetized correctly.\nC) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Matches our result exactly.\nD) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Not alphabetized correctly.\n\n<<<C>>>",
