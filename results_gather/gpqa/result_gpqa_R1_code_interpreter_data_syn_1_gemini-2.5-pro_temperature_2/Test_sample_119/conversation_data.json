    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax interval and the parallax itself. Let's denote the number of stars by `N` and the parallax by `plx`. We want to find how `dN/d(plx)` depends on `plx`.\n\n2.  **State the Assumptions:** The fundamental assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is a constant.\n\n3.  **Relate Number of Stars to Distance:** Let's first consider the number of stars within a certain distance `d` from an observer.\n    *   The volume of a sphere with radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` within this sphere is `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n4.  **Consider a Small Interval (Shell):** We are interested in the number of stars *per unit range*. This suggests looking at a small interval. Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space between distance `d` and `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, can be calculated as the surface area of the sphere (`4πd²`) multiplied by the thickness of the shell (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² dd`.\n    *   The number of stars `dN` within this shell is the density `ρ` times the volume of the shell `dV`.\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρ d² dd`. This expression tells us how the number of stars `dN` changes with distance `d` and the size of the distance interval `dd`.\n\n5.  **Introduce Parallax:** The question is about parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). We need to translate our expression from being in terms of `d` to being in terms of `plx`.\n    *   The definition of parallax is `plx = 1/d` (assuming appropriate units, e.g., `d` in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds).\n    *   We can rewrite the distance in terms of parallax: `d = 1/plx`.\n\n6.  **Relate the Intervals `dd` and `d(plx)`:** We need to find the relationship between the small distance interval `dd` and the corresponding small parallax interval `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `d(d)/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx)`\n    *   `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. For counting stars, we are concerned with the magnitude of the interval. So, we'll consider `|dd| = (1/plx²) |d(plx)|`.\n\n7.  **Combine the Equations:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` back into our equation for `dN`.\n    *   Our starting point was: `dN = 4πρ d² dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = 4πρ (1/plx)² dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)` (ignoring the sign as we're dealing with number counts):\n        `dN = 4πρ (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   Simplify the expression: `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n8.  **Find the Final Quantity:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From our last equation, we can divide by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n9.  **Interpret the Result:** The term `4πρ` is a constant because we assumed the stellar density `ρ` is constant. Therefore, the relationship is:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax varies as the inverse fourth power of the parallax, or `1/plx⁴`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
