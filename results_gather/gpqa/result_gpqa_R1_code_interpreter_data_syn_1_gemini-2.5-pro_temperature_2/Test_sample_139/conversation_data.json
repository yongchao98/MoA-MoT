    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** The problem provides several clues to identify an unknown substance, X, and its reaction products.\n    *   **Clue 1: Melting point of B.** \"The melting point of B ... is very close to 277 K.\" The standard melting point of water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). 276.97 K is extremely close to 277 K. This strongly suggests that substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n    *   **Clue 2: Formation of B.** \"a precipitate G ... when heated, releases B.\" Since B is D₂O, G must be a deuterated hydrate (a compound that has D₂O in its structure or yields it upon decomposition). For example, metal hydroxides lose water when heated to form metal oxides. The deuterated analog, a metal deuteroxide, would lose D₂O. So, G is likely a metal deuteroxide.\n    *   **Clue 3: The reaction.** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W ... and a precipitate G forms.\"\n        *   We have identified B as D₂O, which comes from G. The reaction produces G and W. It is plausible that liquid Y, which reacts to form these deuterated products, is itself D₂O. So, **Y = D₂O**.\n        *   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's check some simple gases that could be formed.\n            *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n            *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (No)\n            *   D₂ (Deuterium): 2 protons (1 from each D), 2 neutrons (1 from each D). (Yes, p=n)\n            *   Given that the reaction likely involves D₂O, the production of D₂ gas is very plausible. Therefore, **W = D₂**.\n    *   **Clue 4: Substance X.** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\" This aligns with X containing deuterium (D), which is a heavier isotope of hydrogen. X reacts with Y (D₂O) to form W (D₂) and G (a precipitate). A powerful reducing agent like a complex metal deuteride would fit this description. Let's hypothesize that **X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   **The Reaction Check:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n            *   This reaction is violent. (Check)\n            *   It uses D₂O as liquid Y. (Check)\n            *   It releases D₂ gas as W. (Check)\n            *   It forms a precipitate, Al(OD)₃ (deuterated aluminum hydroxide), as G. (Check)\n        *   **Heating G:** 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. It releases B (D₂O). (Check)\n    *   **Clue 5: Organic Chemistry Context.**\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has at least 3 oxygens. Strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) reduce both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to alcohols, forming a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which has 2 oxygen atoms. (Check)\n        *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" LiAlD₄ (X) and its analog LiAlH₄ are both common reducing agents. (Check)\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". In chemistry problems of this type, \"atomic mass\" usually refers to the integer mass number of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**. The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (Z=1). In LiAlD₄, hydrogen is present as its heavier isotope, Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminium (Z=13). The only stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27.\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of *all instances* of these elements in the molecule.\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is 1 atom of Aluminium. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative sum:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\n# The problem is a chemical riddle. All steps are based on logical deduction from the clues provided.\n# A final calculation is required based on the identity of Substance X.\n\n# Step 1: Identify Substance X based on the properties and reactions described.\n# Clue 1: B's melting point is ~277 K. Melting point of heavy water D2O is 276.97 K. So, B is D2O.\n# Clue 2: G is a precipitate that releases B (D2O) on heating. This points to G being a deuterated metal hydroxide, like Al(OD)3.\n# Clue 3: W is a gas with equal protons and neutrons. D2 gas (2 protons, 2 neutrons) fits.\n# Clue 4: X reacts with Y (a liquid) to form W (D2) and G (a precipitate). This suggests X is a deuteride and Y is D2O.\n# Hypothesis: X = LiAlD4 (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride), Y = D2O.\n# Reaction: LiAlD4 + 4*D2O -> LiOD + Al(OD)3(s) + 4*D2(g).\n# This reaction fits all clues: X has a heavy isotope (D), it reacts violently with D2O, produces D2 gas (W), and a precipitate Al(OD)3 (G). Heating Al(OD)3 gives D2O (B).\n# Other clues (use in organic chemistry) also fit LiAlD4.\n\n# Step 2: Perform the final calculation.\n# Substance X is LiAlD4.\n# The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n# By atomic number, the lightest element is H (Z=1) and the heaviest is Al (Z=13).\n# The isotope of hydrogen present is Deuterium (D), with mass number 2.\n# The isotope of aluminium is 27Al, with mass number 27.\n\n# Calculate the sum of masses for all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n# Lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D) in LiAlD4.\nmass_of_lightest_element_atoms = 4 * 2 # 4 atoms * mass number of D\n\n# Heaviest element (Aluminium): There is 1 atom of Aluminium in LiAlD4.\nmass_of_heaviest_element_atoms = 1 * 27 # 1 atom * mass number of Al\n\n# Calculate the cumulative sum.\ncumulative_mass = mass_of_lightest_element_atoms + mass_of_heaviest_element_atoms\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a chemical puzzle. I need to identify substance X and then perform a calculation based on its constituent elements.\n\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n    *   **Clue about Substance B:** \"The melting point of B ... is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   Standard temperature in Kelvin (K) is Celsius (°C) + 273.15. So, 277 K is approximately 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n        *   This value is \"very close to 277 K\". This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n    *   **Connection between B, G, and the Reaction:**\n        *   A precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a substance that contains D₂O in its structure or decomposes to form it, like a deuterated hydrate or a metal deuteroxide.\n        *   X reacts with liquid Y to form G and a gas W. Since the products involve deuterium (in D₂O from G), it's logical to assume that either X or Y (or both) contain deuterium. The clue that \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope\" points to X. If Y is the reactant that provides the environment for the reaction, and deuterated products are formed, **Y is likely D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Clue about Gas W:**\n        *   Gas W's molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n        *   Let's check simple gases that could be formed in a reaction with a deuterated substance:\n            *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Protons ≠ Neutrons)\n            *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. (Protons = Neutrons). This is a perfect match.\n        *   Therefore, **W is D₂**.\n\n    *   **Putting the Reaction Together:**\n        *   We have: X + Y(D₂O) → G(precipitate) + W(D₂)\n        *   This is a characteristic reaction of a powerful reducing agent, specifically a metal hydride, with water. For instance, Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) reacts violently with water: LiAlH₄ + 4H₂O → LiOH + Al(OH)₃(precipitate) + 4H₂(gas).\n        *   Let's consider the deuterated analog. If **X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, its reaction with heavy water (Y=D₂O) would be:\n            LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃(precipitate) + 4D₂(gas).\n        *   This perfectly fits our deductions:\n            *   X is LiAlD₄ (contains a heavier isotope, D).\n            *   Y is D₂O.\n            *   The reaction is known to be violent.\n            *   G is Al(OD)₃, a precipitate.\n            *   W is D₂, a gas where protons equal neutrons.\n            *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield Al₂O₃ and D₂O (our substance B). (2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O).\n\n    *   **Confirming with the Organic Chemistry Clues:**\n        *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" LiAlD₄ (X) and its analog LiAlH₄ are widely used as strong reducing agents.\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) contains a ketone and a carboxylic acid group, having at least 3 oxygen atoms. A strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄ reduces both groups to alcohols (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This resulting diol molecule has exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms the identity.\n\n2.  **Conclusion on Substance X:** All clues converge to identify **Substance X as LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Goal:** Calculate the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   **Elements in X (LiAlD₄):** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in its isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1). In LiAlD₄, it exists as Deuterium (D), which has a mass number of 2 (1 proton, 1 neutron). There are **four** D atoms.\n    *   **Heaviest element (by atomic number):** Aluminium (Al, Z=13). Its most common isotope has a mass number of **27**. There is **one** Al atom.\n    *   **Calculation:** The problem asks for the sum of masses of *all instances* of these two elements in the molecule.\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (D): 4 atoms × 2 (mass number) = 8.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Al): 1 atom × 27 (mass number) = 27.\n        *   Cumulative sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nI will use a python script to verify this simple arithmetic.\n\n```python\n# Identify substance X from clues.\n# Clue 1: Melting point of B is ~277 K -> D2O (heavy water) has a melting point of 276.97 K. So, B = D2O.\n# Clue 2: W is a gas with equal protons and neutrons -> D2 gas (2 protons, 2 neutrons). So, W = D2.\n# Clue 3: Reaction X + Y -> G (precipitate) + W (D2). Heating G -> B (D2O).\n# This points to X being a powerful deuteride reagent, like LiAlD4, and Y being D2O.\n# Reaction: LiAlD4 + 4*D2O -> LiOD + Al(OD)3 (precipitate G) + 4*D2 (gas W).\n# Heating Al(OD)3 gives Al2O3 and D2O (B).\n# Clue 4: Use in organic chemistry. LiAlH4 (analog of LiAlD4) is a very common reducing agent. It reduces a keto acid (R-CO-COOH, 3 oxygens) to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH2OH, 2 oxygens). This confirms the identification.\n# So, Substance X is LiAlD4.\n\n# Perform the calculation.\n# Elements in LiAlD4 are Li, Al, D.\n# Lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, D).\n# Heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminium (Al).\n\n# Mass numbers of the isotopes involved: D is 2, Al is 27.\n# Number of atoms in one molecule of LiAlD4: 4 D atoms, 1 Al atom.\n\n# Cumulative mass of lightest element atoms: 4 * 2 = 8\n# Cumulative mass of heaviest element atoms: 1 * 27 = 27\n\n# Total cumulative mass: 8 + 27\nresult = 4 * 2 + 1 * 27\nprint(result)\n\n```\n<<<A>>>",
