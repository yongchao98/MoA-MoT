    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Identify the Frames of Reference**\n\n*   **Galaxy Reference Frame (S):** This is considered the \"stationary\" frame of reference. We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta in this frame.\n*   **Ejecta Reference Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. A clock in this frame measures a time of 50 seconds.\n\n### **2. List the Knowns**\n\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The ejecta moves at 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy. So, v = 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Time in the moving frame (Δt'):** This is the time measured by a clock traveling with the ejecta. This is the proper time. Δt' = 50 s.\n*   **Speed of light (c):** The standard value is approximately c ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n### **3. Determine the Goal**\n\n*   **Distance in the Galaxy frame (d):** We need to calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n### **4. Formulate the Physics**\n\nThe distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (S) is given by the formula:\nd = v * Δt\n\nwhere:\n*   `d` is the distance in frame S.\n*   `v` is the velocity of the ejecta in frame S.\n*   `Δt` is the time elapsed in frame S.\n\nThe problem gives us the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (S'), which is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the proper time. Due to the effects of special relativity, time passes differently in the two reference frames. This phenomenon is known as **time dilation**.\n\nThe time `Δt` measured in the stationary frame (S) is related to the proper time `Δt'` measured in the moving frame (S') by the time dilation formula:\nΔt = γ * Δt'\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n### **5. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c and the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n\n*   v = 60,000 km/s\n*   c = 300,000 km/s (a common and sufficient approximation for such problems)\n*   v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2\n*   (v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04\n*   1 - (v/c)² = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96\n*   γ = 1 / √0.96 ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.02062\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (Δt).**\n\n*   Δt = γ * Δt'\n*   Δt ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s\n*   Δt ≈ 51.031 s\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (d).**\n\n*   d = v * Δt\n*   d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s\n*   d ≈ 3,061,860 km\n\nAlternatively, we can combine the formulas:\nd = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt')\nd = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)\nd = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √0.96\nd = 3,000,000 km / √0.96\nd ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.979796\nd ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\nThis calculated value is very close to the option A. The minor difference might come from using a more precise value for the speed of light, but the result clearly points to a single choice.\n\nLet's use a Python script for a more precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndelta_t_prime = 50  # s\n# Using the standard approximation for the speed of light\nc = 300000  # km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\nbeta_squared = beta**2\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the Lorentz factor\ndenominator = math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / denominator\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\n# Print the final result, rounded to the nearest integer\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem related to special relativity.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   **Problem:** Calculate the distance an ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Velocity of ejecta relative to Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n        *   Time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (proper time), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   **Concept:** Special Relativity, specifically time dilation.\n    *   **Goal:** Find distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Solution:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   `v` is known. `Δt` (time in the Galaxy's frame) is unknown.\n    *   Time dilation relates `Δt` to `Δt'`: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combine the formulas: `d = v * (γ * Δt') = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation (Mental or Scratchpad):**\n    *   Speed of light `c` is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n    *   `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`.\n    *   `(v/c)² = 0.04`.\n    *   `1 - (v/c)² = 0.96`.\n    *   `√(1 - (v/c)²) = √0.96`.\n    *   The non-relativistic distance would be `d_classical = v * Δt' = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   The relativistic distance `d` will be `d = d_classical / √0.96`.\n    *   Since `√0.96` is slightly less than 1, the distance `d` will be slightly more than `3,000,000 km`.\n    *   `√0.96` is approximately `0.98`. `3,000,000 / 0.98` is roughly `3,060,000`. This strongly suggests option A.\n\n4.  **Confirm with the Python Script:**\n    *   I have already provided a Python script for the precise calculation.\n    *   The script calculates the value based on the formula derived: `d = v * (γ * Δt')`.\n    *   Let's re-verify the script logic:\n        *   `v = 60000` (Correct)\n        *   `delta_t_prime = 50` (Correct)\n        *   `c = 300000` (Standard approximation, sufficient here)\n        *   `beta = v / c` (Correct)\n        *   `gamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)` (Correct)\n        *   `delta_t = gamma * delta_t_prime` (Correct)\n        *   `distance = v * delta_t` (Correct)\n    *   The script is logically sound.\n\n5.  **Interpret the Output:**\n    *   The code output is `3061862`.\n    *   This represents the distance in kilometers. `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n    *   Now, compare this result to the given options:\n        *   A) 3,060,000 km\n        *   B) 3,000,000 km\n        *   C) 2,940,000 km\n        *   D) 2,880,000 km\n    *   The calculated value `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option A (`3,060,000 km`). The small difference is likely due to rounding in the option's value itself.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final Answer:**\n    *   State the problem identifies two reference frames: the Galaxy (stationary, S) and the ejecta (moving, S').\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time measured in the ejecta's frame is the proper time, `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy's frame will measure a longer time interval, `Δt`.\n    *   The formula for time dilation is `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   Substituting the time dilation formula: `d = v * γ * Δt'`.\n    *   The python code calculated `d` to be `3,061,862 km`.\n    *   This value is closest to option A, 3,060,000 km. The non-relativistic calculation (`v * Δt'`) gives 3,000,000 km (Option B), which is incorrect because it ignores the time dilation effect. Options C and D are incorrect as they imply time contraction, which is the opposite of what happens. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe calculation has been performed and verified. The code output confirms the manual calculation. The closest answer choice is A. I will now output the final answer in the requested format. This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### **1. Identify the Frames of Reference**\n\n*   **The Galaxy Reference Frame (S):** We can consider this the \"stationary\" frame. The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in this frame.\n*   **The Ejecta Reference Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame, traveling at a high velocity relative to the Galaxy. The time given (50 seconds) is measured in this frame.\n\n### **2. Define the Variables**\n\n*   Velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame), also known as proper time: `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   The speed of light: `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n*   The time elapsed in the stationary frame (the Galaxy's frame): `Δt`.\n*   The distance traveled as measured in the stationary frame (the Galaxy's frame): `d`.\n\n### **3. Apply the Theory of Special Relativity**\n\nAccording to special relativity, time for a moving object passes slower relative to a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called **time dilation**.\n\nThe time `Δt` measured in the stationary Galaxy frame is related to the proper time `Δt'` measured in the moving ejecta's frame by the time dilation formula:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame is given by the simple kinematic formula:\n\n`d = v * Δt`\n\n### **4. Calculation**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n1.  Find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n2.  Calculate `(v/c)²`:\n    `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n3.  Calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96 ≈ 1.02062`\n\nNext, calculate the time `Δt` that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\nFinally, calculate the distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy's frame:\n\n`d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\nThis can be calculated more precisely in one step as `d = v * γ * Δt'`, as shown in the Python script.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe code execution returned a value of `3061862` km. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer without considering time dilation)\n*   C) 2,940,000 km\n*   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance `3,061,862 km` is closest to option A, `3,060,000 km`. The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding in the option value.\n\n<<<A>>>"
