    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their roles.**\n    *   The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O dissolved in water.\n    *   KH2PO4 dissociates completely into K+ (a spectator ion) and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely into 2Na+ (spectator ions), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion), and water.\n    *   The key species are H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which form a conjugate acid-base pair. This pair constitutes a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Determine the relevant equilibria.**\n    Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid with three dissociation steps:\n    *   H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4-       (pKa1)\n    *   H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-      (pKa2)\n    *   HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-      (pKa3)\n    Since the solution is a buffer composed of H2PO4- (the acid) and HPO4^2- (the conjugate base), the second equilibrium (governed by Ka2) will determine the pH and [H+] of the solution. The question asks for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-, which is the product of the third dissociation (governed by Ka3).\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.2000 L.\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol.\n\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = Mass of KH2PO4 / Molar mass of KH2PO4\n        Moles of H2PO4- = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Initial concentration of H2PO4- ([H2PO4-]):\n        [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.2000 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O / Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O\n        Moles of HPO4^2- = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol.\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO4^2- ([HPO4^2-]):\n        [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.2000 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration ([H+]) in the buffer.**\n    Using the equilibrium expression for the second dissociation:\n    Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n    [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    We can approximate the equilibrium concentrations with the initial concentrations because the dissociation constant is small.\n    [H+] ≈ (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H+] ≈ (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * 1.308\n    [H+] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M.\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration ([PO4^3-]).**\n    Now, we use the equilibrium expression for the third dissociation:\n    Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    Rearranging to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n    [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n    We use the calculated [H+] and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-], as its further dissociation into PO4^3- is negligible.\n    [PO4^3-] ≈ (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.23 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nTo get a more precise result, let's use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\n\n# Dissociation constants\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial moles and concentrations\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\n\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-)\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nPO4_3minus_conc = Ka3 * conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc\n\nprint(f\"{PO4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.24e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO4^3-] is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The python code executed successfully and the output `6.24e-07` represents the calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions ([PO4^3-]) in Molarity (M).\n\nThe calculation was performed as follows:\n1.  The initial concentrations of the buffer components, [H2PO4-] and [HPO4^2-], were calculated from their respective masses, molar masses, and the total volume of the solution.\n    *   [H2PO4-] ≈ 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02809 M\n2.  The hydrogen ion concentration [H+] was determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation equivalent for Ka2, which governs the buffer system:\n    [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 / 0.02809) ≈ 8.11x10^-8 M.\n3.  Finally, the orthophosphate concentration [PO4^3-] was calculated using the equilibrium expression for Ka3:\n    [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809) / (8.11x10^-8) ≈ 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\nThe result from the code, 6.24x10⁻⁷ M, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
