    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    *   The name \"5-butylnona-2,6-diene\" describes the starting molecule.\n    *   **\"nona\"**: A 9-carbon main chain.\n    *   **\"2,6-diene\"**: Two double bonds, starting at carbons 2 and 6.\n    *   **\"5-butyl\"**: A butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n    *   The structure is:\n        ```\n                       CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃ (Butyl group)\n                       |\n        CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃\n        (C1)(C2)(C3)(C4)(C5)(C6)(C7)(C8)(C9)\n        ```\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is 9 (nona-) + 4 (butyl) = 13.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₁₃H₂₄. The product must be an isomer with the same formula.\n\n2.  **Identify the Type of Reaction:**\n    *   Heating a molecule with multiple double bonds strongly suggests a pericyclic reaction.\n    *   The most common thermal pericyclic rearrangement for a molecule with this structure is a **[3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement**, also known as the **Cope rearrangement**.\n    *   A Cope rearrangement occurs in molecules containing a **hexa-1,5-diene** framework. A 1,5-diene has its double bonds separated by three single bonds (`C=C-C-C-C=C`).\n    *   Let's check if our reactant, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, has a 1,5-diene system. The double bonds start at positions 2 and 6. The difference is 6 - 2 = 4, which is characteristic of a 1,5-diene system (like in hexa-1,5-diene where the difference is 5 - 1 = 4).\n    *   The core system that will rearrange involves carbons C2 through C7: `C(2)=C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)=C(7)`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement Mechanism:**\n    *   The Cope rearrangement involves a cyclic transition state where one sigma bond breaks and another forms, while the pi bonds shift position.\n    *   In the `C(2)=C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)=C(7)` system, the sigma bond between the two allylic fragments, which is the **C4-C5 bond**, will break.\n    *   A new sigma bond will form between the \"ends\" of the system, **C2 and C7**.\n    *   The pi bonds will shift: the `C2=C3` bond moves to become `C3=C4`, and the `C6=C7` bond moves to become `C5=C6`.\n    *   Let's analyze the transformation of the substituents. This type of rearrangement shuffles the groups attached to the 1,5-diene framework.\n    *   It is helpful to view the reactant as being composed of two allylic fragments connected by the C4-C5 bond:\n        *   Fragment 1: `CH₃-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-`\n        *   Fragment 2: `-CH(5)(Butyl)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   The rearrangement effectively swaps the \"heads\" and \"tails\" of these fragments.\n        *   The `CH₃-` group (C1) at one end of the reactant's diene system becomes a methyl substituent in the product.\n        *   The `-CH₂CH₃` group (C8-C9) at the other end becomes an ethyl substituent.\n        *   The butyl group at the central position (C5) becomes the end of the new main chain.\n        *   A hydrogen atom from C4 becomes part of the new `CH₂=` group at the start of the product chain.\n\n4.  **Determine the Product Structure:**\n    *   Let's trace where the pieces of the reactant end up, leading to the product's structure.\n        *   The initial `CH₃-CH=` end (C1-C2) becomes a methyl group substituent (`-CH₃`).\n        *   The initial `-CH(butyl)-` group (C5) becomes the new tail of the longest carbon chain (`-...CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   The initial `-CH₂CH₃` tail (C8-C9) becomes an ethyl group substituent (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   The main chain re-forms from the remaining carbons.\n    *   This specific pattern of substituent shuffling corresponds to the formation of **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**. Let's draw this molecule to confirm.\n        ```\n                                 CH₃ (Methyl group from original C1)\n                                 |\n        CH₂=CH-CH-CH-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃\n            (C1)(C2)(C3)(C4)(C5)(C6)...(C10)\n                     |\n                     CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl group from original C8-C9)\n        ```\n    *   This product is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n5.  **Check the Options:**\n    *   **A) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene:** This structure matches our derived product from the Cope rearrangement.\n    *   **B) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene:** The positions of the substituents and the double bonds do not match the expected rearrangement pattern.\n    *   **C) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene:** This molecule has a different substituent pattern and main chain length.\n    *   **D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene:** This is identical to option B.\n\nThe reaction is a classic Cope rearrangement. The starting material, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, rearranges through a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift to form 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
