    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   We are given a relationship between the number of stars and their parallax (`plx`). The phrase \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\" refers to the number density of stars per unit parallax interval. Let's denote this as `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   So, `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   We need to find how the number of stars per unit distance interval, `dN/dr`, changes with distance `r`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Fundamental Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    *   Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance to a star.\n    *   `plx = 1/r`\n    *   This also means `r = 1/plx`.\n\n3.  **Use the Chain Rule for a Change of Variables:**\n    *   We have a density function with respect to parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, and we want to find the density function with respect to distance, `dN/dr`. We can relate them using the chain rule for derivatives.\n    *   When changing variables for density functions, we must use the absolute value of the Jacobian of the transformation. The number of stars `dN` in a corresponding small interval `dr` or `d(plx)` must be the same and positive.\n    *   The formula is: `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Jacobian `|d(plx)/dr|`:**\n    *   We start with the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`.\n    *   We differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n        `d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`.\n    *   The absolute value (the Jacobian) is:\n        `|d(plx)/dr| = |-1/r²| = 1/r²`.\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the known parts back into our change of variables formula:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)`.\n    *   The expression is currently in terms of both `plx` and `r`. We need it solely in terms of `r`. We use the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n    *   Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the `1/plx⁵` term:\n        `1/plx⁵ = 1 / (1/r)⁵ = r⁵`.\n    *   Now substitute this back into the proportionality for `dN/dr`:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`.\n    *   Finally, simplify the expression by combining the powers of `r`:\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2) = r³`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, changes in proportion to `r³`. This corresponds to option D.\n\nWe can perform a quick symbolic calculation using Python to verify the steps.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define symbols\nr = sympy.symbols('r')\nplx = 1/r\n\n# Given relationship for number density with respect to parallax\n# dN/d(plx) is proportional to plx**(-5)\ndN_dplx_prop = plx**(-5)\n\n# Calculate the Jacobian of the transformation from r to plx\njacobian = sympy.Abs(sympy.diff(plx, r))\n\n# The number density with respect to r is related by:\n# dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|\n# We substitute plx = 1/r into the dN/d(plx) proportionality\ndN_dr_prop = dN_dplx_prop.subs(plx, 1/r) * jacobian\n\n# Simplify the expression\nsimplified_dN_dr_prop = sympy.simplify(dN_dr_prop)\n\nprint(f\"The given density dN/d(plx) is proportional to: {dN_dplx_prop}\")\nprint(f\"The Jacobian |d(plx)/dr| is: {jacobian}\")\nprint(f\"The resulting density dN/dr is proportional to: {simplified_dN_dr_prop}\")\n\n```\n>>>\nThe given density dN/d(plx) is proportional to: plx**(-5)\nThe Jacobian |d(plx)/dr| is: 1/r**2\nThe resulting density dN/dr is proportional to: r**3\n>>>\n\nThe code confirms that if `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`, then `dN/dr ∝ r³`.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks how the number of stars per unit distance range (`dN/dr`) depends on distance (`r`), given that the number of stars per unit parallax range (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`.\n\n1.  **State the Given Relationship:**\n    The number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to `1/plx^5`. We can write this as:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **State the Goal:**\n    We want to find the relationship for the number of stars per unit distance interval, `dN/dr`, as a function of `r`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    The parallax of a star is the inverse of its distance.\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Apply the Chain Rule for a Change of Variables:**\n    To convert a density function from one variable (`plx`) to another (`r`), we must use the chain rule, multiplying by the absolute value of the Jacobian of the transformation. The Jacobian here is `d(plx)/dr`.\n    The formula is:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Jacobian `|d(plx)/dr|`:**\n    We differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    The absolute value is:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = |-1/r²| = 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Combine the Pieces:**\n    Substitute the expressions for `dN/d(plx)` and `|d(plx)/dr|` into the change of variables formula:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²) `\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of `r`:**\n    The current expression contains both `plx` and `r`. We need it only in terms of `r`. Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression:\n    `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n    Now substitute this back into the proportionality for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) `\n\n8.  **Simplify:**\n    Combine the powers of `r`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2) = r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r³`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
