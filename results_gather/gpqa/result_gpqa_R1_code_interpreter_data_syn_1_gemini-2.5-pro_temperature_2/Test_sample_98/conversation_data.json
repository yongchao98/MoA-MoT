    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the correct compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group present but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated, consistent with this observation.\n*   **\"One of the signals... is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\"**: This means a specific proton in the molecule is coupled to three distinct groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   A single proton (giving the **d**oublet splitting).\n    *   A group of two equivalent protons (giving the **t**riplet splitting).\n    *   A group of three equivalent protons (giving the **q**uartet splitting).\n*   **\"a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\"**: This means another, different proton in the molecule is also coupled to three distinct groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   A single proton (giving the **d**oublet splitting).\n    *   A group of two equivalent protons (giving the **t**riplet splitting).\n    *   A different group of two equivalent protons (giving another **t**riplet splitting).\n\nThe task is to find which of the four structures has two different protons that would produce these specific complex splitting patterns.\n\n**3. Structural Analysis of the Options**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of each option and determine the expected splitting patterns for its key protons. We'll number the carbon chain starting from the carboxylic acid group (C1).\n\n**A) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nThis corresponds to the structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\n```\n        Et(on C4)  Et(on C3)\n        |          |\n   CH₃ - CH(b) -- CH(a) -- CH₂ -- COOH\n   (5)   (4)        (3)      (2)     (1)\n```\n*   **Proton H(a) at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The proton H(b) at C4 (1H neighbor → **doublet**).\n    2.  The two protons at C2 (2H neighbors → **triplet**).\n    3.  The two protons of the ethyl group's -CH₂- on C3 (2H neighbors → **triplet**).\n    The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n*   **Proton H(b) at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The proton H(a) at C3 (1H neighbor → **doublet**).\n    2.  The two protons of the ethyl group's -CH₂- on C4 (2H neighbors → **triplet**).\n    3.  The three protons of the methyl group at C5 (3H neighbors → **quartet**).\n    The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n\nConclusion for A: This structure perfectly accounts for both of the complex splitting patterns described in the NMR data.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\nThis is 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid.\n*   The proton at C3 is coupled to H(C2), CH₃(on C3), and CH₂(C4). Neighbors: 1H, 3H, 2H. This gives a **dtq** (or dqt).\n*   There is no proton in this molecule coupled to two different sets of two protons, so there is **no dtt signal**.\n*   Conclusion: Inconsistent with the data.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\nThis is 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid.\n*   The proton at C3 is coupled to H(C4), CH₃(on C3), and CH₂(C2). Neighbors: 1H, 3H, 2H. This gives a **dtq**.\n*   The proton at C4 is coupled to H(C3), CH₃(on C4), and CH₃(C5). Neighbors: 1H, 3H, 3H. This gives a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq), not a dtt.\n*   Conclusion: Inconsistent with the data.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\nThis is 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid.\n*   The proton at C3 is coupled to H(C2), CH₂(of Et on C3), and CH₂(C4). Neighbors: 1H, 2H, 2H. This gives a **dtt**.\n*   There is no proton in this molecule coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors, so there is **no dtq signal**.\n*   Conclusion: Inconsistent with the data.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly compound **A**, which is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has two different protons that would generate a `dtt` signal (from the proton at C3) and a `dtq` signal (from the proton at C4), matching the ¹H NMR data provided.\n\n<<<A>>>"
