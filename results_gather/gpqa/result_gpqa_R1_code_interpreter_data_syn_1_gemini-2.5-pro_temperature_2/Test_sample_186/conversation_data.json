    "Answering this question requires a multi-step process:\n1.  **Determine the detection limit of ESPRESSO:** We need to find the faintest apparent visual magnitude (V mag) a star can have to be detected with a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N) of 10 in a 1-hour exposure using a single VLT unit telescope (1-UT mode).\n2.  **Determine the observability of each star:** We need to check if each star is visible from the Paranal Observatory in Chile (latitude ~24.6° S). A star's declination (DEC) determines its visibility from a given latitude.\n3.  **Calculate the apparent magnitude of each star:** For the stars listed with absolute magnitude and distance, we need to calculate their apparent magnitude.\n4.  **Compare and count:** For each star that is observable from Paranal, we compare its apparent magnitude to the ESPRESSO detection limit.\n\n### Step 1: ESPRESSO Detection Limit\nAccording to the official ESO documentation for ESPRESSO, for the 1-UT (one 8m telescope) High-Resolution (HR) mode, the instrument can achieve an S/N of approximately 10 for a star with an apparent visual magnitude **V ≈ 16.5** in a one-hour exposure. Therefore, a star is considered detectable if its V magnitude is ≤ 16.5.\n\n### Step 2 & 3: Analyzing Each Star\n\n**a) Canopus:**\n*   **Observability:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52°. Since Paranal is in the Southern Hemisphere, stars with southern declinations are well-positioned for observation. Canopus is clearly visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the night sky, with V = -0.74.\n*   **Conclusion:** -0.74 is much brighter than the 16.5 magnitude limit. **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris:**\n*   **Observability:** Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of approximately +89°. Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of -24.6°. The highest declination visible from Paranal is approximately 90° - 24.6° = +65.4°. Polaris is at a declination far too north and is never above the horizon at Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Polaris is not detectable** because it is not visible from the observatory.\n\n**c) Star with M=15, d=10 pc:**\n*   **Observability:** The star has a declination of 0°, placing it on the celestial equator. It is visible from virtually all observatories on Earth, including Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):** We use the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`, where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs.\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(1) = 15 + 0 = 15.0`\n*   **Conclusion:** An apparent magnitude of 15.0 is brighter than the 16.5 limit. **This star is detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with M=15, d=200 pc:**\n*   **Observability:** DEC = 0°, so it is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 15 + 6.505 = 21.51`\n*   **Conclusion:** An apparent magnitude of 21.51 is fainter than the 16.5 limit. **This star is not detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with M=15, d=5 pc:**\n*   **Observability:** DEC = 0°, so it is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.49`\n*   **Conclusion:** An apparent magnitude of 13.49 is brighter than the 16.5 limit. **This star is detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with M=15, d=50 pc:**\n*   **Observability:** DEC = 0°, so it is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 15 + 3.495 = 18.50`\n*   **Conclusion:** An apparent magnitude of 18.50 is fainter than the 16.5 limit. **This star is not detectable.**\n\nTo be sure of the calculations, we can use a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# ESPRESSO detection limit (V magnitude for S/N=10 in 1h with 1-UT)\nv_limit = 16.5\n\n# List of stars to check: (Name, Visible from Paranal, V_mag) or (Name, Visible, M_abs, distance_pc)\nstar_data = [\n    (\"Canopus\", True, -0.74, None),\n    (\"Polaris\", False, 1.98, None), # Not visible from Paranal (Dec +89 deg)\n    (\"Star c\", True, 15, 10),\n    (\"Star d\", True, 15, 200),\n    (\"Star e\", True, 15, 5),\n    (\"Star f\", True, 15, 50)\n]\n\ndetectable_count = 0\ndetectable_stars_list = []\n\nfor name, visible, M_or_m, d_pc in star_data:\n    if not visible:\n        print(f\"{name}: Not detectable (not visible).\")\n        continue\n\n    if d_pc is None: # Known apparent magnitude\n        v_mag = M_or_m\n    else: # Calculate apparent magnitude\n        M_abs = M_or_m\n        v_mag = M_abs + 5 * math.log10(d_pc / 10)\n\n    if v_mag <= v_limit:\n        detectability = \"Detectable\"\n        detectable_count += 1\n        detectable_stars_list.append(name)\n    else:\n        detectability = \"Not detectable\"\n    \n    print(f\"{name}: V_mag = {v_mag:.2f}. {detectability}.\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nTotal number of detectable stars: {detectable_count}\")\nprint(f\"List of detectable stars: {detectable_stars_list}\")\n```\nStar c: V_mag = 15.00.

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the listed stars are both visible from the Paranal Observatory and brighter than the detection limit of the ESPRESSO spectrograph.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine ESPRESSO's Detection Limit**\n\nThe problem states that a star is detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 is achieved in a 1-hour exposure. The provided link to the ESPRESSO overview states: *\"In 1-UT mode, ESPRESSO can be used... to reach S/N=10 in 1 hour for a G2V star with V=16.5 magnitude\"*. This means the limiting apparent magnitude (V) for detection is approximately **V = 16.5**. Any star with an apparent magnitude V ≤ 16.5 will be detectable.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine Observability from Paranal**\n\nParanal Observatory is located in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately -24.6°. A star's declination (DEC) determines its visibility.\n\n*   **Positive DEC (Northern Stars):** A star at Paranal is visible if its declination is greater than the co-latitude minus 90 degrees. i.e., DEC > -24.6° - 90° = -114.6°. However, practically, for good observations, it needs to rise sufficiently above the horizon. The visibility limit for a circumpolar star in the north is Latitude + 90° > DEC, which is not applicable here as Polaris is being checked. More simply, a star's highest point in the sky is 90° - |Latitude - DEC|. A star with DEC = +89° at Latitude = -24.6° will never rise above the horizon.\n*   **Negative DEC (Southern Stars):** These stars are well-positioned for observation from Paranal.\n*   **DEC = 0° (Celestial Equator):** These stars are visible from all locations on Earth, except the poles.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Each Star**\n\nWe will now check each star for its visibility and apparent magnitude.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Observability:** Canopus has a declination of about -52°, making it easily visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** Canopus is very bright, with an apparent visual magnitude (V) of **-0.74**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since -0.74 is much brighter (smaller number) than the limit of 16.5, **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Observability:** Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of approximately +89°. From a latitude of -24.6°, Polaris is never above the horizon.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because it is not visible from the observatory, **Polaris is not detectable.**\n\n**c) Star with M = 15 mag, d = 10 pc**\n*   **Observability:** The star has a declination of 0°, making it visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):** We use the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d / 10)`\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(1) = 15 + 0 = 15.0`\n*   **Conclusion:** The apparent magnitude is V = 15.0. Since 15.0 ≤ 16.5, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with M = 15 mag, d = 200 pc**\n*   **Observability:** DEC = 0°, so it is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 21.51`\n*   **Conclusion:** The apparent magnitude is V ≈ 21.5. Since 21.5 > 16.5, **this star is not detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with M = 15 mag, d = 5 pc**\n*   **Observability:** DEC = 0°, so it is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 13.49`\n*   **Conclusion:** The apparent magnitude is V ≈ 13.5. Since 13.5 ≤ 16.5, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with M = 15 mag, d = 50 pc**\n*   **Observability:** DEC = 0°, so it is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 18.49`\n*   **Conclusion:** The apparent magnitude is V ≈ 18.5. Since 18.5 > 16.5, **this star is not detectable.**\n\n### **Final Count**\n\nThe detectable stars are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star with M=15 at 10 pc\n3.  Star with M=15 at 5 pc\n\nA total of **3** stars from the list are detectable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
