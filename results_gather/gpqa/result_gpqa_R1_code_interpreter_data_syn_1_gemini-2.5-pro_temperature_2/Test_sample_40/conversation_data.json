    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\n1.  **Define the Reference Frames:**\n    *   **S Frame (Laboratory Frame):** This is the frame where the observer is at rest.\n    *   **S' Frame (Glass's Rest Frame):** This is the frame moving along with the glass.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **v:** The velocity of the glass (S' frame) relative to the observer (S frame). The problem states the glass is moving at velocity `v`.\n    *   **u':** The speed of light inside the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass (S' frame). By definition, the index of refraction `n` is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). So, `n = c / u'`, which means `u' = c / n`. Given that `c = 1`, the speed of light in the glass's rest frame is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **u:** The speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory (S frame). This is the value we need to find.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n    Here, both the light (with speed `u'`) and the glass (with speed `v`) are moving in the same direction, so we use a plus sign.\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these gives:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To clear the fractions within the numerator and denominator, find a common denominator for each part.\n    *   Numerator: `(1/n) + v = (1 + n*v) / n`\n    *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n\n    Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n    `u = ( (1 + n*v) / n ) / ( (n + v) / n )`\n\n    The `/ n` term in both the main numerator and the main denominator cancels out.\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option C.\n\nA) (1-n*v)/(n+v) - Incorrect\nB) (1+n*v)/(n-v) - Incorrect\nC) (1+n*v)/(n+v) - Correct\nD) 1 - Incorrect\n\n<<<C>>>"
