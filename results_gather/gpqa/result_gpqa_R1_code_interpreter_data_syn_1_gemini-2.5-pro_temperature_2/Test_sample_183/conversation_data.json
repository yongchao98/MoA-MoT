    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's determine the relative positions of the substituents:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe key structural features are:\n*   The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are **ortho** to each other.\n*   The tert-butyl and nitro groups are **ortho** to each other.\n*   The ethoxy and nitro groups are **meta** to each other.\n\nThe molecule has a crowded 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern. Synthesizing such a specific isomer requires careful control of the directing effects of substituents, often involving blocking groups and functional group interconversions.\n\n**2. Evaluate Directing Effects**\n\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Alkyl group. Ortho, para-director. Activating. Very bulky, so it can sterically hinder ortho positions.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Alkoxy group. Strong ortho, para-director. Strong activator.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strong meta-director. Strong deactivator.\n\n**3. Strategize the Synthesis**\n\nThe synthesis requires placing three groups with specific relationships. A common strategy for such complex patterns is:\n1.  Install a primary group.\n2.  Use a blocking group to force subsequent substitutions into desired positions.\n3.  Introduce other groups, possibly converting functional groups to change their directing effects (e.g., -NO2 to -NH2).\n4.  Remove the blocking group at a later stage.\n\nThe presence of reagents like `SO3/H2SO4` (sulfonation, a common blocking strategy) and `Fe/HCl` followed by `NaNO2/HCl` (reduction of a nitro group to an amine, then diazotization) strongly suggests this type of strategy. The ethoxy group is likely formed from a phenol (-OH) via Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`). The phenol itself is likely formed from an amine via diazotization and hydrolysis.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed sequences. The crucial part is to establish the correct ortho/meta/para relationships early on. The target has an **ortho** relationship between the `tBu` group and the `OEt` group. Since the `OEt` group is synthesized from a precursor (`-NH2` -> `-OH` -> `-OEt`) that was originally a nitro group, we must find a sequence that places the `tBu` group and an initial `NO2` group **ortho** to each other.\n\n*   **Paths starting with nitration (like B):** Benzene -> Nitrobenzene. Friedel-Crafts alkylation does not work on the strongly deactivated nitrobenzene ring. So, B is incorrect.\n*   **Paths that install `tBu` and `NO2` para to each other (like Path A):**\n    *   `i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> t-butylbenzene`\n    *   `ii) Nitration -> p-tert-butylnitrobenzene` (major product). Here, `tBu` and `NO2` are para. The subsequent functional group conversions will lock this para relationship between `tBu` and the eventual `OEt` group. The target needs them to be ortho. Thus, any path proceeding from p-tert-butylnitrobenzene is incorrect for a high-yield synthesis of the target.\n\n*   **Paths that establish an ortho `tBu/NO2` relationship (like Path C):** This is the most promising approach. Let's trace it carefully.\n    *   **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on Benzene:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) `SO3/H2SO4` (Sulfonation):** The bulky `tBu` group directs the incoming sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`) to the sterically accessible **para** position. This forms **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This step is crucial as it \"blocks\" the para position.\n    *   **iii) `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration):** Now we nitrate. The directing effects are:\n        *   `-tBu` (at C1) is an o,p-director. Para is blocked by `-SO3H`. So it directs to C2/C6.\n        *   `-SO3H` (at C4) is a m-director. It directs to C2/C6.\n        *   Both groups direct the `NO2` group to the same position: **ortho** to the tert-butyl group (C2). The product is **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This successfully places the `tBu` and `NO2` groups ortho to each other. This is the correct precursor relationship.\n    *   **iv) `Fe/HCl` (Reduction):** The nitro group is reduced to an amine. Product: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **v) `NaNO2/HCl; H2O/heat` (Diazotization & Hydrolysis):** The amine is converted to a diazonium salt, which is then hydrolyzed to a phenol (`-OH`). Product: **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **vi) `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson Ether Synthesis):** The phenol is converted to an ethoxy ether. Product: **2-ethoxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. So far, the synthesis is sound and has established the ortho relationship between tBu and OEt. The structure is 1-tert-butyl-2-ethoxy-4-benzenesulfonic acid.\n\n    *   **Final Steps (Nitration and Desulfonation):** We now need to introduce the final nitro group and remove the sulfonic acid blocking group. The order is critical. Let's analyze the sequence as written in option C.\n        *   **vii) `dilute H2SO4/heat` (Desulfonation):** Removes the `-SO3H` group. Product: **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene**.\n        *   **viii) `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration):** We nitrate 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene. The strong activating `-OEt` group directs ortho/para (to positions 4 and 6), not meta (position 3). The `-tBu` group directs to position 3. Since `-OEt` is the stronger director, the major products would be the 4-nitro and 6-nitro isomers, not the desired 3-nitro isomer. This sequence is low-yield and thus incorrect for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n    *   **Correcting the final steps:** For this synthesis to work, the last two steps must be swapped.\n        *   Correct step vii) `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration) on **2-ethoxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: The `-OEt` (strong o,p activator), `-tBu` (o,p activator), and `-SO3H` (m-deactivator) all work together to direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 relative to the OEt. This leads to the crowded intermediate `1-tert-butyl-2-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-benzenesulfonic acid`.\n        *   Correct step viii) `dilute H2SO4/heat` (Desulfonation): Removing the `-SO3H` group from C4 yields the final target molecule: **1-tert-butyl-2-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** (which is the same as 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSequence C provides the correct strategic framework (alkylation, blocking, nitration to set ortho relationship, FGI, final nitration, and removal of blocking group). Although the last two steps in the provided option text appear to be in the wrong order for a high-yield synthesis, it is the only option that correctly establishes the crucial ortho relationship between the tert-butyl group and the precursor to the ethoxy group. The other options fail at much earlier stages. Therefore, Option C represents the most plausible reaction sequence, assuming a typo in the order of the final two reagents.\n\nI will use Python to formalize the step-by-step logic for the correct synthetic pathway which is a modification of option C.\n```python\ndef check_synthesis_pathway():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chemical synthesis pathway for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    The analysis concludes that a specific 9-step sequence, which is a corrected version of option C,\n    is the most chemically sound approach.\n    \"\"\"\n    target = \"2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\"\n    relationships = {\n        \"OEt-tBu\": \"ortho\",\n        \"tBu-NO2\": \"ortho\",\n        \"OEt-NO2\": \"meta\"\n    }\n\n    # Ideal path, a corrected version of option C\n    path_C_corrected = [\n        \"1.

    "Here is a breakdown of the correct synthesis pathway to form 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, which demonstrates why option C represents the correct strategy.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule**: The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are:\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy)** at position 1: a strong ortho, para-directing activator.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl)** at position 2: an ortho, para-directing activator (but sterically bulky).\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro)** at position 3: a strong meta-directing deactivator.\n    Achieving this specific substitution pattern, especially the crowded 1,2,3 arrangement, requires careful strategic planning, often involving blocking groups.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Proposed Sequences**:\n\n    *   **Step 1: Initial Substitution**: The first substituent can be a nitro group or a tert-butyl group.\n        *   Starting with nitration (like option B) is problematic because the resulting nitrobenzene is strongly deactivated, and Friedel-Crafts alkylation will not proceed. So, B is incorrect.\n        *   Starting with Friedel-Crafts alkylation to make tert-butylbenzene is the logical first step. Options A, C, and D all start this way.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Installing the Second Group**:\n        *   After forming tert-butylbenzene, direct nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`) would yield primarily the *para* product (4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) due to the steric hindrance of the bulky tert-butyl group. This would lead to a final product where the tert-butyl and the eventual ethoxy group are *para* to each other, which is not our target. Options A and D proceed this way at some point and are thus incorrect for a high-yield synthesis.\n        *   The correct strategy is to use a **blocking group**. Sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`) is reversible and a common way to do this. The bulky tert-butyl group directs the sulfonic acid (`-SO3H`) group to the *para* position. This blocks the most favorable position and forces the next substituent into one of the *ortho* positions. This is the strategy used in option C.\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Walkthrough of Option C**:\n\n    *   **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene produces **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) `SO3/H2SO4`**: Sulfonation occurs at the *para* position due to the directing effect and steric hindrance of the tert-butyl group, yielding **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is the key blocking step.\n    *   **iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Both the `-tBu` group (ortho-directing) and the `-SO3H` group (meta-directing) direct the incoming nitro group to position 2. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**, successfully establishing the crucial *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl and the nitro group.\n    *   **iv) `Fe/HCl`**: The nitro group (`-NO2`) is reduced to an amino group (`-NH2`), forming **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **v) `NaNO2/HCl` then `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: This two-step process first converts the amino group to a diazonium salt, which is then hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (`-OH`). This forms **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: This is the Williamson ether synthesis. The phenolic `-OH` is deprotonated by `NaOH` and then reacts with ethyl bromide (`EtBr`) to form the ethoxy group (`-OEt`). The product is **2-ethoxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **Final steps**: Now, a second nitro group must be added, and the sulfonic acid blocking group must be removed.\n        *   The correct sequence for a high-yield synthesis is to perform the final nitration **before** removing the blocking group. The powerful activating `-OEt` and `-tBu` groups will direct the incoming nitro group to the position *meta* to the deactivating `-SO3H` group, resulting in the desired 1,2,3 substitution pattern.\n        *   After this nitration, desulfonation with dilute `H2SO4` removes the `-SO3H` group to yield the final product.\n    *   **Conclusion on Option C**: While the sequence of the last two reaction types in option C (vii and viii as written) is suboptimal for a high-yield synthesis, it is the only option that correctly outlines the necessary sequence of transformations (alkylation -> blocking -> ortho-nitration -> functional group interconversion -> final nitration -> deblocking). The overall strategy of option C is sound and superior to all other options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
