    "This problem involves the reaction between a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). To find the pH of the final solution, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of acids and bases.**\n2.  **Neutralize the strong acid and strong base.**\n3.  **Neutralize the remaining strong species with the weak species.**\n4.  **Determine the final composition of the solution.**\n5.  **Calculate the pH based on the final composition.**\n\nHere is the detailed step-by-step reasoning:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of H+, OH-, and CH3COOH.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L * 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = 0.400 L * 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol H+**\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Ba(OH)2 dissociates to provide two OH- ions per formula unit: Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-.\n    *   Moles = 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L * 2 = **0.180 mol OH-**\n\n**Step 2: Neutralization of the strong acid and strong base.**\nThe H+ from HCl will react completely with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.\n*   Reaction: H+ + OH- -> H2O\n*   Initial moles H+ = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles OH- = 0.180 mol\n*   Since there are more moles of OH- than H+, H+ is the limiting reactant. All 0.080 moles of H+ will be consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol OH-**\n\n**Step 3: Neutralization of the remaining strong base with the weak acid.**\nThe remaining 0.100 moles of OH- will react with the 0.050 moles of CH3COOH.\n*   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n*   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Initial moles OH- = 0.100 mol\n*   Since there are more moles of OH- than CH3COOH, CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. All 0.050 moles of CH3COOH will be consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol OH-**\n\n**Step 4: Determine the final composition and volume.**\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of the strong base, OH-.\n*   Final moles of excess OH- = 0.050 mol\n*   The total volume of the solution is the sum of the individual volumes:\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final pH.**\nThe presence of a strong base (excess OH-) will be the dominant factor in determining the pH. We can calculate the pOH from the concentration of the excess OH- and then find the pH.\n\nThe following Python code performs the calculations:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial moles\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.500 * 0.1  # 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH\nmoles_hcl = 0.400 * 0.2      # 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl\nmoles_baoh2 = 0.300 * 0.3    # 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2\nmoles_oh = moles_baoh2 * 2   # Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- ions\n\n# Step 2: Reaction between strong acid (H+) and strong base (OH-)\nmoles_oh_after_hcl_reaction = moles_oh - moles_hcl\n\n# Step 3: Reaction between remaining OH- and weak acid (CH3COOH)\nmoles_oh_final = moles_oh_after_hcl_reaction - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 4: Calculate final volume\ntotal_volume_L = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\n\n# Step 5: Calculate final OH- concentration, pOH, and pH\n# The pH is determined by the excess strong base.\nconcentration_oh_final = moles_oh_final / total_volume_L\npOH = -math.log10(concentration_oh_final)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH=}\")\n```\n>>>\npH=12.620076300529539\n\nThe final calculation shows that the pH of the solution is approximately 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>",
