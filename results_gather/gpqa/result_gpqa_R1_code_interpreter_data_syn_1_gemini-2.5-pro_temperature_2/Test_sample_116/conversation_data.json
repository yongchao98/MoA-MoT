    "An organic moiety shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. We will analyze each compound for elements of chirality, such as chiral centers or axial chirality, and the absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. Each ring has two substituents at the positions ortho to the inter-ring bond: a methylcarboxylate group (-COOCH3) and a nitro group (-NO2).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule is a candidate for a type of axial chirality known as atropisomerism. For atropisomerism to occur and lead to optical activity, two conditions must be met:\n        1.  Rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings must be severely restricted. The bulky substituents at all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6')—namely -COOCH3 and -NO2—provide significant steric hindrance, preventing free rotation.\n        2.  The molecule must not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. In this case, each phenyl ring is asymmetrically substituted (a -COOCH3 group at position 2 and a -NO2 group at position 6 are different). This asymmetric substitution on both rings ensures that the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to restricted rotation and the lack of molecular symmetry, the molecule exists as a pair of stable, non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine carbon-2 (the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group):\n        *   It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n        *   It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        *   It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n    *   Since all four groups attached to carbon-2 are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R- and S-methyl lactate) and thus exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is a ketone with two phenyl rings attached to the carbonyl carbon: (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. There are no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because it possesses a plane of symmetry, benzophenone is achiral and cannot show optical isomerism. It is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-ene-1,4-dioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule is planar. The plane containing all the atoms is a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, the molecule possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (has a chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nThe moieties that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
