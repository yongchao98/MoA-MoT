    "**1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data to Identify Compound X**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The broad absorption in the region **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, specifically one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are indicative of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield (deshielded), broad singlet for one proton is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**). This confirms the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggests a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Signals:** Let's piece together the structure of the alkyl group attached to the benzene ring.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Fragment: -CH₂-CH₃.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the fragment above. It's a multiplet because it is adjacent to both the methyl group (3H) and another proton.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). Fragment: -CH-CH₃.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton). It's a multiplet because it's coupled to the protons of both adjacent methyl and methylene groups.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Connecting the fragments gives the following structure: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:**\n    Based on all the data, Compound X is a para-disubstituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C), but this is the starting material, not the final product.\n\n**2. The Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to perform a complete reduction of carbonyl-containing functional groups, including aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids, down to the corresponding alkane (CH₂ or CH₃ group).\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the aromatic ring will be reduced completely to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring itself are unreactive under these conditions.\n\n    *   **Starting Material (Compound X):** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Reaction:** Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n**3. Identifying the Final Product from the Options**\n\n*   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This structure matches our deduced final product.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: The alkyl group is incorrect (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X).\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This is an incorrect structure for both the starting material and the product.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
