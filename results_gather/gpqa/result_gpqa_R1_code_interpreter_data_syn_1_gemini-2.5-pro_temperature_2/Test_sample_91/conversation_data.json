    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass**\n\nFirst, we need to find the chemical formula of the compound `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`. We count the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms:\n\n*   `(CH3)2C=`: 3 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens\n*   `-CH-`: 1 Carbon, 1 Hydrogen\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: 2 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens\n*   `-CH=`: 1 Carbon, 1 Hydrogen\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: 3 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens\n\nAdding these up:\n*   Total Carbons (C) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   Total Hydrogens (H) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nSo, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNext, we calculate the molar mass of C12H22. Using atomic masses C ≈ 12 g/mol and H ≈ 1 g/mol:\nMolar Mass = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is calculated relative to the elements in their standard states. For C12H22, the formation reaction is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy required to turn the reactants into gaseous atoms:\n12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n\nUsing the given data:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.\n*   Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol.\n\nThe total enthalpy of atomization for the elements is:\nΔH_atom(elements) = (12 mol * ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 mol * BE(H-H))\nΔH_atom(elements) = (12 * 1000) + (11 * 100)\nΔH_atom(elements) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### **3. Count the Bonds in the Molecule**\n\nTo calculate the total bond energy of the molecule, we must count the number of each type of bond in its structure: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\n*   **C=C (Carbon-Carbon double bonds):** There are two double bonds in the structure.\n    *   `C=C` bonds = 2\n\n*   **C-C (Carbon-Carbon single bonds):**\n    *   Bonds within the main carbon chain: There are 4 single bonds linking the groups (C=C)-**C**-(C)-**C**-(C=C). Let's trace it: (C=C)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-(C=C). That's 4 C-C bonds in the backbone.\n    *   Bonds attaching the methyl (CH3) groups: The `(CH3)2C=` group has 2 C-C bonds. The `-CH(CH3)-` group has 1 C-C bond. The `=C(CH3)2` group has 2 C-C bonds. Total = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 bonds.\n    *   Total `C-C` bonds = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n*   **C-H (Carbon-Hydrogen single bonds):** The total number of hydrogen atoms is 22, and each is bonded to a carbon atom.\n    *   Total `C-H` bonds = 22\n\nSanity check: For an acyclic molecule, Total Bonds = (Total Atoms) - 1.\nTotal atoms = 12 C + 22 H = 34. Total bonds should be 33.\nOur count: 2 (C=C) + 9 (C-C) + 22 (C-H) = 33. The count is correct.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Compound**\n\nThe total bond energy is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound (the energy required to break all bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound).\n\nUsing the given bond energies:\n*   Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom(compound) = (9 * BE(C-C)) + (2 * BE(C=C)) + (22 * BE(C-H))\nΔH_atom(compound) = (9 * 200) + (2 * 300) + (22 * 400)\nΔH_atom(compound) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when the compound is formed from its gaseous atoms (which is equal to its total bond energy).\n\nΔH_f = [Enthalpy of atomization of elements] - [Enthalpy of atomization of compound]\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### **6. Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the given options:\nA) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the total bond energy of the molecule, not the enthalpy of formation).\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 1900 kJ/g (The value is correct, but the units are kJ/g, not kJ/mol).\nD) 67.4 kJ/mol\n\nThere might be a unit conversion required or a typo in the options. Let's convert our answer from kJ/mol to kJ/g using the molar mass (166 g/mol).\n\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, a python script can be used.\n```python\n# Given data\ndH_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nBE_HH = 100       # kJ/mol\nBE_CC = 200       # kJ/mol\nBE_C_eq_C = 300   # kJ/mol\nBE_CH = 400       # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular formula: C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of elements: 12*C(s) + 11*H2(g) -> 12*C(g) + 22*H(g)\ndH_atom_elements = num_C * dH_atom_C + (num_H / 2) * BE_HH\n\n# Number of bonds in the molecule\nnum_CC_single = 9\nnum_CC_double = 2\nnum_CH = 22\n\n# Total bond energy of the compound (Enthalpy of atomization of compound)\ndH_atom_compound = (num_CC_single * BE_CC) + (num_CC_double * BE_C_eq_C) + (num_CH * BE_CH)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\ndHf_mol = dH_atom_elements - dH_atom_compound\n\n# Molar Mass\nmolar_mass_compound = num_C * 12.0 + num_H * 1.0\n\n# Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g\ndHf_g = dHf_mol / molar_mass_compound\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): {dHf_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): {dHf_g}\")\n```\n>>>\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n<<<\nThe script confirms the manual calculation. The enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol, which is equivalent to 11.44 kJ/g. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
