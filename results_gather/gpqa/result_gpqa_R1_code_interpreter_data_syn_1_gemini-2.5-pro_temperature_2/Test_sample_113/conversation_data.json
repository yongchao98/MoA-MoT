    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n    *   This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction.\n    *   **Step 1: Nucleophilic Attack.** The cyanide ion (`CN⁻`) from `NaCN` is a nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   `CH₃C(=O)CH₂CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Step 2: Protonation.** The negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (`-OH`) group. This requires a source of protons (`H⁺`).\n    *   `CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃C(OH)(CN)CH₂CH₃` (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    *   Reagent `A` must be a proton source. Looking at the options, `H₃O⁺` (representing an aqueous acid like HCl or H₂SO₄) is the standard reagent used to provide this proton. `NaHSO₃` is used to form crystalline bisulfite addition compounds and is not the correct reagent for this step. Therefore, `A` must be `H₃O⁺`. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (`-C≡N`) into a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`). This transformation is called hydrolysis.\n    *   The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is typically carried out under either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, usually with heating. The presence of `B` and `H₂O` indicates aqueous hydrolysis.\n    *   We need to choose between `HCl` (from option B) and `CH₃COOH` (from option C) as the catalyst `B`.\n    *   `HCl` is a strong acid, while `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires harsh conditions. A strong acid like `HCl` is a much more effective catalyst for this reaction than a weak acid like `CH₃COOH`. Therefore, `HCl` is the appropriate reagent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, `A = H₃O⁺`.\n    *   For the second reaction, `B = HCl`.\n    *   Combining these findings, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
