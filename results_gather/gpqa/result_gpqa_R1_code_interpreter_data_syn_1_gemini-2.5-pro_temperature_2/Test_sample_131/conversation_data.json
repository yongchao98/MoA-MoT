    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe task is to identify which pair of compounds from the given options, when mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Given NMR Data**\n\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nAll candidate molecules have the molecular formula C10H14. The total number of protons is 14.\n\n### **3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of chemically non-equivalent protons, which corresponds to the number of signals in the NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a center of inversion and two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   *Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the methyl group at C2 and the proton at C4.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are not equivalent. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups: the one at C2, the one at C5, and the equivalent pair at C1 and C3. This will result in **three singlets** with integrations of **3H** (from C2-Me), **3H** (from C5-Me), and **6H** (from C1-Me and C3-Me). The integration ratio is 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   *Summary:* 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C3-C4 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   *Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule contains ethyl groups (-CH2-CH3). The aliphatic protons will show coupling, resulting in a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3).\n    *   Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, this compound can be immediately ruled out. Therefore, option **D) is incorrect**.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the spectra of the individual compounds for each option in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets). This would result in a total of three singlets with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. This **does not match** the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (one 2H singlet) + Prehnitene (one 2H singlet). Assuming their chemical shifts are different, this produces **two singlets**. Since they both represent 2H in a 1:1 mixture, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This **MATCHES** the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Prehnitene (two 6H singlets). This produces a total of **three singlets** (assuming no accidental overlap). The integration values are 12H, 6H, and 6H. The relative ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also **MATCHES** the data.\n    *   Since both the aromatic and aliphatic regions match the experimental data, this option is the correct answer.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets). This would result in a total of three singlets with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. This **does not match** the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nTo verify the analysis for the correct option (B), a python script can be used to lay out the logic clearly.\n\n```python\n# Analysis for the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option B)\n\n# Compound 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)\n# Aromatic signals: 1 singlet (2H)\n# Aliphatic signals: 1 singlet (12H)\n\n# Compound 2: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)\n# Aromatic signals: 1 singlet (2H)\n# Aliphatic signals: 2 singlets (6H each)\n\n# --- Predicted spectrum for a 1:1 mixture ---\n\n# Aromatic Region:\n# We expect one 2H singlet from Durene and one 2H singlet from Prehnitene.\n# This results in two signals.

    "**1. Deconstruct the Problem:**\n\n*   **Sample:** A 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds.\n*   **Molecular Formula of each compound:** C10H14 (Total 14 protons).\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm): 2 signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm): 3 signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Goal:** Identify the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Candidate Compound:**\n\nWe need to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity (splitting pattern), and their relative integration for each individual compound. This depends on the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   *Symmetry:* Highly symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry between C1-C6 and C2-C5, and another between C1-C2 and C4-C5.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This gives **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   *Aliphatic Protons:* The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This gives **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   *Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   *Symmetry:* Has one plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are in different environments. This gives **two singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   *Aliphatic Protons:* There are three sets of equivalent methyl groups: (1) C1 & C3 are equivalent, (2) C2 is unique, (3) C5 is unique. This gives **three singlets** with integrations of **6H** (C1+C3), **3H** (C2), and **3H** (C5). The integration ratio is 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   *Summary:* 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   *Symmetry:* Has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C1-C2 and C4-C5 bonds.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   *Aliphatic Protons:* The methyl groups at C1 & C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 & C3 are equivalent. This gives **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   *Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The aliphatic region would show signals for ethyl groups (-CH2-CH3). Due to spin-spin coupling, we would expect a quartet and a triplet, not singlets. This compound can be eliminated immediately, ruling out option D.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options based on the Combined Spectra:**\n\nWe will now \"mix\" the predicted spectra for the pairs in each option in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   *Aromatic:* Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets). Total = **3 aromatic signals**. This does not match the observed 2 signals.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   *Aromatic:* Durene (one 2H singlet) + Prehnitene (one 2H singlet). This gives **two singlets**. Since they are from a 1:1 mixture and each represents 2H, their integration ratio is **1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n    *   *Aliphatic:* Durene (one 12H singlet) + Prehnitene (two 6H singlets). This gives a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The simplified ratio is 12:6:6 = **2:1:1**. **This also matches the data.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   *Aromatic:* Durene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets). Total = **3 aromatic signals**. This does not match the observed 2 signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce all singlet signals in the aliphatic region.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nThe mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only one that perfectly accounts for the observed 1H NMR data: two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<B>>>"
