    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (NaNH2, sodium amide) in liquid ammonia. These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton (or deuteron in this case) from a carbon atom *ortho* to the bromine atom. The reactant, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two such ortho positions:\n    *   **Position C-2:** This position has a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   **Position C-6:** This position has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\n    This leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of Deuteron from C-2:** The amide ion can remove the deuteron from C-2. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C-1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. Since the deuterium atom itself is removed in this step, the resulting intermediate is a **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n        *   `1-bromo-2-d-benzene --(NH2-)--> Benzyne + D-NH2 + Br-`\n        *   While this pathway is possible, it is slower than removing a proton due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond). However, since the question asks for all *possible* products, this pathway must be considered.\n\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of Proton from C-6:** The amide ion can remove the proton from C-6. This is the faster, major pathway. Following the proton removal, the bromide ion is lost from C-1, forming a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. In this case, the deuterium atom at C-2 is unaffected and remains on the ring. The resulting intermediate is a **deuterated benzyne** (specifically, 3-deuterobenzyne or 1,2-didehydro-3-deuterobenzene).\n        *   `1-bromo-2-d-benzene --(NH2-)--> 3-d-Benzyne + H-NH2 + Br-`\n\n    So, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: non-deuterated benzyne and 3-d-benzyne.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n    *   **Reaction of Non-deuterated Benzyne (from Path A):**\n        *   This benzyne is symmetrical. Attack by NH2⁻ can occur at C-1 or C-2.\n        *   Attack at C-1 followed by protonation gives aniline.\n        *   Attack at C-2 followed by protonation also gives aniline.\n        *   This pathway leads to only one product.\n        *   **Product 1: Aniline**\n\n    *   **Reaction of 3-d-Benzyne (from Path B):**\n        *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C-1 and C-6, and a deuterium at C-2. It is not symmetrical. Attack by NH2⁻ can occur at two distinct positions of the triple bond: C-1 or C-6.\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** If NH2⁻ adds to C-1, a carbanion is formed at C-6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields a product with the -NH2 group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (ortho-deuteroaniline).\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** If NH2⁻ adds to C-6, a carbanion is formed at C-1. Protonation of this carbanion yields a product with the -NH2 group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. These two groups are meta to each other. This is **3-deuteroaniline** (meta-deuteroaniline).\n        *   This pathway leads to two different products.\n        *   **Product 2: 2-deuteroaniline**\n        *   **Product 3: 3-deuteroaniline**\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Unique Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three structurally distinct organic products:\n    1.  Aniline (C₆H₅NH₂)\n    2.  2-deuteroaniline (o-D-C₆H₄NH₂)\n    3.  3-deuteroaniline (m-D-C₆H₄NH₂)\n\n    Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
