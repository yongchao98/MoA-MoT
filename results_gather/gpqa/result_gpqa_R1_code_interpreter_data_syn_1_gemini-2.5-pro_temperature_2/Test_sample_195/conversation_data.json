    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of energy conservation.** The total energy of the isolated system (the oscillating mass) is constant. For a relativistic particle moving in a potential, the total energy is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n\n2.  **Define the energies involved.**\n    *   The potential energy $U(x)$ for a spring obeying Hooke's Law ($F=-kx$) is given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where we set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n    *   The total relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$. This includes both the rest energy $mc^2$ and the kinetic energy $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\n    *   The total conserved energy of the system is $E_{total} = E_{particle} + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply energy conservation to the extreme points of the motion.** We equate the total energy at two specific points in the particle's oscillation: the point of maximum displacement and the point of maximum speed.\n\n    *   **At the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude):**\n        *   The position is $x=A$.\n        *   The particle is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v=0$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (point of maximum speed):**\n        *   The position is $x=0$.\n        *   The potential energy is $U(0) = 0$.\n        *   The speed is at its maximum value, $v = v_{max}$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n4.  **Set the energies at these two points equal to each other.** Since the total energy is conserved, we have:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.**\n    *   Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   To isolate the square root term, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides of the equation:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.** The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option C exactly.\n\nAs a final check, in the classical limit ($c \\rightarrow \\infty$), the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$ becomes very small. Using the binomial approximation $(1+x)^n \\approx 1+nx$, we get $v_{max} \\approx c\\sqrt{1 - (1 - \\frac{kA^2}{mc^2})} = c\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$, which is the correct classical result. This confirms the validity of our relativistic formula.\n\n<<<C>>>"
