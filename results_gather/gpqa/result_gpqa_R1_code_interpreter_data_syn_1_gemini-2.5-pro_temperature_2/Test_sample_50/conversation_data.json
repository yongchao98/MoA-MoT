    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Problem Setup**\nWe have a system consisting of a grounded conducting sphere and a point charge.\n*   Charge of the point charge = `q`\n*   Radius of the conducting sphere = `R`\n*   The sphere is \"grounded\", which means its electric potential is maintained at zero (V = 0).\n*   Distance of the point charge `q` from the center of the sphere = `d`. We assume `d > R`.\n*   We need to find the net potential energy `U` of this configuration.\n\n**2. The Method of Images**\nThis problem can be simplified using the method of images. The electric field outside the conducting sphere, created by the point charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere's surface, is identical to the electric field created by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere. The conducting sphere is removed in this model.\n\nThe image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) are chosen such that the potential on the surface where the sphere was (i.e., at a radius `r=R`) is zero, satisfying the \"grounded\" condition.\n\nFor a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` are given by:\n*   Image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge is located on the line connecting the center and the external charge `q`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position at distance `d` from the sphere's center.\n\nThe work done (`U`) is the integral of the external force (`F_ext`) over the path. The external force is the negative of the electrostatic force (`F_e`) exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`. `F_ext = -F_e`.\n\n`U = W_ext = ∫ from ∞ to d (F_ext ⋅ dl)`\n\nThe force `F_e` exerted by the sphere on charge `q` is the same as the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. Let's consider the charge `q` to be at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center as it is brought in from infinity.\n\nThe force on charge `q` at position `x` is:\n`F_e(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between q and q')²`\n\nAt position `x`:\n*   The distance of `q` from the center is `x`.\n*   The position of the image charge is `b = R^2 / x`.\n*   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/x)`.\n*   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `x - b = x - R^2/x = (x^2 - R^2)/x`.\n\nThe electrostatic force on `q` is:\n`F_e(x) = k * q * [-q(R/x)] / [(x^2 - R^2)/x]²`\n`F_e(x) = -k * q² * (R/x) * [x² / (x² - R^2)²]`\n`F_e(x) = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R^2)²`\n\nThe force is attractive (negative sign), pointing towards the sphere. The external force required to hold the charge must be in the opposite direction:\n`F_ext(x) = -F_e(x) = k * q² * R * x / (x² - R^2)²`\n\nNow, we calculate the work done by this external force to bring the charge from infinity (`x=∞`) to `x=d`:\n`U = ∫ from ∞ to d (F_ext(x) dx)`\n`U = ∫ from ∞ to d [k * q² * R * x / (x² - R^2)²] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we can use a u-substitution:\n*   Let `u = x² - R²`\n*   Then `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du / 2`\n\nThe integral becomes:\n`U = k * q² * R ∫ [1 / u²] * (du / 2)`\n`U = (k * q² * R / 2) ∫ u⁻² du`\n`U = (k * q² * R / 2) * [-1 / u]`\n\nNow substitute back `u = x² - R²` and evaluate at the limits of integration:\n`U = (k * q² * R / 2) * [-1 / (x² - R²)]` evaluated from `x = ∞` to `x = d`.\n\n`U = (k * q² * R / 2) * [ (-1 / (d² - R²)) - (-1 / (∞² - R²)) ]`\n`U = (k * q² * R / 2) * [ -1 / (d² - R²) - 0 ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n**4. Alternative Method (Interaction Energy)**\nA known result in electrostatics is that the energy of a charge `q` in the presence of a grounded conductor is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the position of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor.\n\n`V_induced` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the position of `q` (distance `d`).\n*   Position of `q`: `d`\n*   Position of `q'`: `b = R²/d`\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'`: `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n*   `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n*   `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d]`\n*   `V_induced = - k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nNow, calculate the total energy `U`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\nB) `U = - k * q² * d / (d² - R²)`\nC) `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R² / (d² - R²)`\nD) `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * d / (d² + R²)`\n\nOur result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
