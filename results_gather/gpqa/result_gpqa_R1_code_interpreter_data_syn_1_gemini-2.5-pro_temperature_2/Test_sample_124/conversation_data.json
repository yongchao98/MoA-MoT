    "An analysis of the problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The potential given is $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. In three dimensions, this can be written in Cartesian coordinates as $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the restoring force is the same in all directions, which is reflected by the single angular frequency $\\omega$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates. It can be treated as three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, one for each coordinate (x, y, z). The energy eigenvalue of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i$ is a non-negative integer quantum number ($n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$).\n\n    The total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent 1D oscillators:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n$ can be any non-negative integer ($n = 0, 1, 2, ...$). The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy Levels and States:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the state with the lowest possible energy. It corresponds to the smallest value of $n$, which is $n=0$. This happens only when $n_x=0, n_y=0, n_z=0$.\n        *   Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This is the next energy level, corresponding to $n=1$.\n        *   Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        *   Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This is the state the question asks for. It corresponds to $n=3$.\n        *   Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy (Number of Linearly Independent Eigenfunctions):** The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum up to the principal quantum number $n$. We need to find the degeneracy for the third excited state, where $n=3$. So we need to find the number of integer solutions to the equation $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z \\geq 0$.\n\n    We can list the possible combinations for $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n    1.  One number is 3, the others are 0: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). This gives 3 states.\n    2.  One number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). This gives 6 states.\n    3.  All numbers are 1: (1,1,1). This gives 1 state.\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, one can use the \"stars and bars\" combinatorial formula for finding the number of solutions to this type of equation. The degeneracy $g_n$ for a level $n$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by:\n    $g_n = \\binom{n+k-1}{k-1} = \\binom{n+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{n+2}{2} = \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy (i.e., its degeneracy) is 10.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nB) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\nD) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n\nThe calculated values match option D."
