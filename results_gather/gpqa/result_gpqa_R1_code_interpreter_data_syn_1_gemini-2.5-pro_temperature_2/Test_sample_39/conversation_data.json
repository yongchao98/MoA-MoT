    "In the context of a synthetic organic chemistry lab, purification of a newly made compound from byproducts and unreacted starting materials is a critical step. The phrase \"on top of each other\" is a common idiom chemists use when discussing the results of chromatography, particularly Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography.\n\n1.  **Chromatography as a Separation Technique:** Chromatography is one of the most powerful and widely used techniques for separating compounds in a mixture. This technique works by separating compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent or mixture of solvents).\n2.  **Role of Polarity:** A compound's polarity is the key property that determines how it behaves during chromatography.\n    *   Polar compounds tend to stick strongly to the polar stationary phase (like silica gel) and move slowly.\n    *   Non-polar compounds interact less with the stationary phase and are carried along more quickly by the mobile phase (the eluent).\n3.  **The Idiom \"On Top of Each Other\":** When a chemist runs a TLC plate to check the purity of a reaction mixture, the different compounds separate into distinct spots. If two compounds (for example, the desired product and a byproduct) have very similar polarities, they will travel at nearly the same speed up the TLC plate. The result is that their spots do not resolve and appear as a single, elongated spot or two spots that are significantly overlapped. Chemists will look at this and say the spots are \"on top of each other.\" The same principle applies to column chromatography, where compounds with similar polarities will elute from the column at the same time, making their separation impossible with that particular solvent system.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   **A) Similar boiling points:** This would make separation by distillation difficult, but the phrase \"on top of each other\" is less commonly used for this situation than for chromatography.\n*   **B) Non-covalent interactions:** While these interactions are fundamental to how compounds behave in chromatography, the root cause of the separation failure is the *similarity* in the overall polarity that governs these interactions, not the interactions themselves.\n*   **D) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is used for characterization, not for standard separation techniques like chromatography or distillation. Two compounds can be easily separated even if they happen to have similar optical rotations.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and common meaning of the chemist's complaint is that the compounds have similar polarities, making them very difficult to separate using the standard technique of chromatography.\n\n<<<C>>>"
