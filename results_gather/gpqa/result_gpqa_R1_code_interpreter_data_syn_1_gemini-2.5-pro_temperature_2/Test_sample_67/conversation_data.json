    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, so its spin is described by the spin operators S_x, S_y, and S_z.\n*   The magnetic moment is **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, the magnetic field is **B** = B**ẑ** (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian of the system is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γ(**S** ⋅ B**ẑ**) = -γBS_z.\n*   The particle is \"aligned with the field,\" which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of this Hamiltonian.\n*   The eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 (for spin up, |↑⟩_z) and -ħ/2 (for spin down, |↓⟩_z).\n*   The corresponding energies are E_up = -γB(ħ/2) and E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2).\n*   The lowest energy state is E_up, so the initial state of the particle at t=0 is the spin-up state along the z-axis.\n*   In the S_z basis (where |↑⟩_z is represented as [1, 0]ᵀ and |↓⟩_z is [0, 1]ᵀ), the initial state vector is:\n    |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z = [[1], [0]]\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian (t ≥ 0)\n\n*   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B'** = B**ŷ** (pointing in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian, which governs the time evolution for t ≥ 0, is:\n    H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γ(**S** ⋅ B**ŷ**) = -γBS_y.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe state |ψ(t)⟩ for t ≥ 0 evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, whose solution is:\n|ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iH't/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩\n\nSubstituting H' = -γBS_y:\n|ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩ = e^(iγBS_y t/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩\n\nTo calculate this, we use the matrix representation of the S_y operator in the S_z basis:\nS_y = (ħ/2)σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSubstituting this into the evolution operator:\ne^(iγBS_y t/ħ) = e^(iγB((ħ/2)σ_y)t/ħ) = e^(i(γBt/2)σ_y)\n\nWe can use the general formula for the exponential of Pauli matrices: e^(iθ **n** ⋅ **σ**) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)(**n** ⋅ **σ**), where I is the identity matrix.\nIn our case, θ = γBt/2 and the operator is σ_y. So, the evolution operator U(t) is:\nU(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ_y\nU(t) = cos(γBt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(γBt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\nU(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), 0], [0, cos(γBt/2)]] + [[0, sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), 0]]\nU(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]\n\nNow, we apply this operator to the initial state |ψ(0)⟩:\n|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t) |ψ(0)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [[1], [0]]\n|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]\n\nIn terms of the basis vectors, this is:\n|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(γBt/2)|↓⟩_z\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment\n\nThe goal is to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩.\n⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩\n\nFirst, we calculate ⟨S_z(t)⟩. In the S_z basis, S_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]].\n⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩\n⟨S_z(t)⟩ = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]\n⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]\n⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ):\n⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * (γBt/2))\n⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)\n\nFinally, we find the expectation value of the magnetic moment component:\n⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)\n\n### 5. Identify the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe expression for the average of the z-component of the moment is ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = A*cos(ωt), where A is the amplitude γħ/2 and ω is the angular frequency.\nFrom our result, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is:\nω = γB\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin expectation vector precesses around the new magnetic field direction (**ŷ**) with an angular frequency ω = γB, called the Larmor frequency. The z-component of this precessing vector therefore oscillates with this same frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is γB. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
