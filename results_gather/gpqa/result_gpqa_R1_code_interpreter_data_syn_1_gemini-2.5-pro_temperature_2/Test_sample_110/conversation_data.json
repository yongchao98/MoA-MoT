    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK\n\nThis reaction is a **Michael Addition**.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base, t-BuOK (potassium tert-butoxide), will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), at positions C-2 and C-6.\n    *   C-2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group), so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C-6 has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only abstract the proton from C-6 to form the enolate. The double bond of the enolate will be between C-1 and C-6.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C-6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The β-carbon is the `CH₂` group of `CH₂=CH-COOEt`.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The initial adduct is protonated during the workup step to yield the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The product has an ethyl propanoate side chain (`-CH₂CH₂COOEt`) attached to the C-6 position of the cyclohexanone ring. The C-6 carbon also retains its original methyl group.\n    *   The full structure is `6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one`.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A as per the Options:**\n    *   The options name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate. This means the `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` chain is the parent structure.\n    *   Parent name: `ethyl propanoate`. The chain is numbered `C(3)H₂-C(2)H₂-C(1)OOEt`.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent attached at C-3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Now, we must name the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment on the ring is designated as C-1.\n        *   The attachment point is the original C-6 of the ketone. This becomes C-1 of the substituent group.\n        *   The methyl group that was on C-6 is now on C-1. -> **1-methyl**.\n        *   The carbonyl group (original C-1) is adjacent to the attachment point (C-1). -> **2-oxo**.\n        *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (original C-2) is adjacent to the carbonyl, so it is at position C-3. -> **3-ethyl, 3-methyl**.\n    *   Combining these gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This name matches options C and D.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH\n\nThis is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂`). The protons on the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`, also known as crotononitrile), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** KOH (potassium hydroxide), a strong base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Carbanion:**\n    *   KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n    *   `CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂ + OH⁻  ⇌  CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂ + H₂O`\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile. In `CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`, the β-carbon is the `CH` group bearing the methyl substituent.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by the solvent (water) to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The new C-C bond links the `CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃` fragment from 1-nitropropane to the `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` fragment from but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The structure is: `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the nitrile group (`-CN`) has priority and defines the suffix `-nitrile`. The nitrile carbon is C-1.\n    *   We identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n    *   The chain is `C¹N - C²H₂ - C³H(CH₃) - C⁴H(NO₂) - C⁵H₂ - C⁶H₃`.\n    *   This is a 6-carbon chain, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We locate the substituents on this chain:\n        *   A methyl group (`-CH₃`) is on C-3. -> **3-methyl**.\n        *   A nitro group (`-NO₂`) is on C-4. -> **4-nitro**.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This name matches options B and C.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\nB) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\nC) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct A, Correct B)\nD) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n\nThe correct combination of products is found in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
