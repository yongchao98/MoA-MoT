    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter at carbon 5 has the (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H₃O⁺). LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The carbonyl group at carbon 3 is reduced to a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reduction creates a new chiral center at carbon 3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is chiral (at C5), the introduction of a new chiral center at C3 will result in the formation of two diastereomeric products. The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged.\n    *   Product 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   These two products (Product 1 and Product 2) are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" implies both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Reaction:** The two carbonyl groups at carbons 2 and 4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent can produce all possible stereoisomers. For pentane-2,4-diol, the possible stereoisomers are:\n    *   Product 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Product 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Product 5: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis of Products:**\n    *   Product 3 and Product 4 are enantiomers of each other. Since the reaction starts from achiral materials, they will be formed as a 1:1 mixture, i.e., a racemic mixture.\n    *   Product 5, the (2R, 4S) isomer, has a plane of symmetry (passing through the central CH₂ group) and is therefore a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) isomer is the same meso compound.\n    *   The meso compound (Product 5) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair (Product 3 and Product 4).\n*   So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers: a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot** be separated. They will elute as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and **can** be separated. They will elute as distinct peaks.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:** The final mixture contains five compounds (Products 1-5).\n    *   Products 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will give **two separate peaks**.\n    *   Products 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They have identical polarities and will co-elute, giving **one single peak**.\n    *   Product 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of Products 3 and 4. It has a different polarity and will give **a separate peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂). They have different structures, molecular weights, and polarities. Therefore, the peaks from Reaction I will not overlap with the peaks from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** (2 peaks from Rxn I) + (1 peak from the enantiomeric pair + 1 peak from the meso compound from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with different stereoisomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Chiral HPLC can separate enantiomers.\n    *   Chiral HPLC can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:** The column is expected to resolve all five distinct stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n    *   Product 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 1\n    *   Product 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 2\n    *   Product 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 3\n    *   Product 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4\n    *   Product 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 5\n*   All five compounds are stereochemically different, so we expect to see five separate peaks (assuming an ideal, efficient column).\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC: 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC: 5\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\n# A simple script to formalize the counting of products and peaks.\n\n# Products from Reaction I\n# P1 = (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n# P2 = (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n# P1 and P2 are diastereomers.\n\n# Products from Reaction II\n# P3 = (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n# P4 = (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n# P5 = meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n# P3 and P4 are enantiomers.

After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone that is chiral, containing one stereocenter at the 5th carbon atom in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at carbon-3 is reduced by Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH) to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at carbon-3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is a single enantiomer ((S) at C5) and a new stereocenter is formed at C3, the two possible products will be (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers because one stereocenter is the same (C5-S) while the other is different (C3-S vs C3-R).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The two ketone groups at carbons 2 and 4 are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). This creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since we start with an achiral molecule and use an achiral reagent, all possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol will be formed. The possible stereoisomers are (2R,4R), (2S,4S), and (2R,4S).\n    *   (2R,4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are enantiomers. They will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. The (2S,4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chromatography**\n\nThe total combined mixture contains five different stereoisomeric compounds:\n*   From Reaction I: Two diastereomers.\n*   From Reaction II: Two enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**A. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore will elute together as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will separate into different peaks.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will resolve into **two separate peaks**.\n    2.  The enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) from Reaction II have identical physical properties and will co-elute as **one peak**.\n    3.  The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will elute as **a separate peak**.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C₇ alcohols) and Reaction II (C₅ diol) are structurally very different and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 peaks.**\n\n**B. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with each unique stereoisomer.\n*   It is designed to separate enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   Therefore, each of the five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> 1 peak\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> 1 peak\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> 1 peak\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> 1 peak\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> 1 peak\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n**Summary**\n*   Number of peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5\n*   Number of peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 4\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
