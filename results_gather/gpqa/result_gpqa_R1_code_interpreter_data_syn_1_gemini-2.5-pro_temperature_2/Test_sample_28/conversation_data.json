    "An anti-nutritional compound's synthesis needs to be eliminated, which requires inactivating the gene responsible for it. The most effective way to inactivate a gene is to introduce a mutation that prevents the formation of a full-length, functional protein. The types of mutations we are looking for are primarily:\n1.  **Nonsense mutation:** This mutation changes a codon for an amino acid into a premature stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This results in a truncated, and almost certainly non-functional, protein.\n2.  **Frameshift mutation:** This is caused by an insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame, changing all the codons downstream from the mutation, which typically leads to a completely different and non-functional protein, often also containing a premature stop codon.\n\nA **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid, might alter the protein's function but is not guaranteed to eliminate it. A **silent mutation** does not change the amino acid sequence and has no effect on the protein's function.\n\nLet's analyze the effects of each mutation by translating the beginning of the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. We read the DNA in groups of three (codons).\n\n*   **Intact gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n    *   Amino Acids: `Met Phe Leu Ala Gly Thr ...`\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   The sequence differs from the intact gene at several points.\n    *   DNA: `5'-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n    *   Comparison: The `TTT` codon becomes `TTC`, and the `CTC` codon becomes `TAC`.\n    *   Amino Acids: `Met Phe Tyr Ala Gly Thr ...`\n    *   `TTT` and `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so the first change is a **silent mutation**.\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), which is a **missense mutation**. This changes one amino acid. It might affect protein function, but it's not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5'-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ...`\n    *   Comparison: The `CTC` codon in the intact gene is replaced by `TAA`.\n    *   Amino Acids: `Met Phe STOP`\n    *   The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will terminate translation after only two amino acids have been joined. The resulting peptide is extremely short and will be non-functional. This is a very effective way to inactivate the gene.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   The sequence shows a single nucleotide change (`C` to `T`) at position 7.\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ...`\n    *   Comparison: The `CTC` (Leu) codon from the intact gene becomes `TAC` (Tyr). The rest of the reading frame appears intact for a few more codons, although another change occurs later.\n    *   Amino Acids: `Met Phe Tyr Ala Gly Val ...`\n    *   This is a **missense mutation**, changing Leucine to Tyrosine. Similar to Mutant 1, this is less likely to completely eliminate the protein function than a nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   The sequence shows a single nucleotide deletion (the `G` at position 11 is missing).\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ...`\n    *   Comparison: The intact sequence is `CTCGCT`, while the mutant is `TACGCT`. The deletion is not straightforwardly visible without alignment, but the output from our analysis shows a **frameshift**.\n    *   Amino Acids: `Met Phe Tyr Ala Thr Ser ...`\n    *   This mutation causes a frameshift starting from the 5th codon. All subsequent amino acids will be incorrect, likely leading to a non-functional protein. A frameshift is a strong candidate for gene inactivation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth Mutant 2 (nonsense mutation) and Mutant 4 (frameshift mutation) are strong candidates for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. However, a nonsense mutation that introduces a stop codon very early in the sequence (at the 3rd codon, in this case) is arguably the most certain and direct way to ensure that no functional protein is produced. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
