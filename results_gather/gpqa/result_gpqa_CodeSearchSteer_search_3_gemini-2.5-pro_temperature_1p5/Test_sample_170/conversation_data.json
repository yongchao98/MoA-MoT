    "Based on the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution and analysis of experimental data, the correct order can be determined.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents on the benzene ring:\n\n*   **Substances with Meta-Directing Groups:** These are deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br⁺) primarily to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is consequently very low.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene): -NO₂ is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid): -COOH is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate): -COOC₂H₅ is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n*   **Substances with Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer is significant.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene): -CH₃ is an activating, ortho, para-directing group.\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene): -C₂H₅ is an activating, ortho, para-directing group.\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene): -Cl is a deactivating, but ortho, para-directing group.\n\n### Ranking the Substances\n\n#### **Part 1: The Meta-Directors (Lowest Para-Yield)**\n\nSubstances 4, 6, and 2 will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer because they are meta-directors. For these groups, electrophilic attack at the ortho and para positions is highly disfavored. Data from nitration reactions (which follow similar principles to bromination) show the para isomer yields for these types of compounds are very small. For example, the nitration of nitrobenzene (4) yields only about 2% of the para-isomer. The nitration of ethyl benzoate (2) gives about 5% para-product. The nitration of benzoic acid (6) yields about 2% para-product. The order of deactivating strength is generally -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅, which correlates with very low para yields. Based on available data for similar reactions, we can establish their low position in the overall ranking. Looking at the options provided, they all correctly place combinations of 2, 4, and 6 at the beginning. The precise order among these three is nuanced, but data for nitration shows para-yields as: -NO₂ (7%/2%), -CO₂H (22%/2%), -CO₂Et (28%/5%). The numbers vary but consistently show very low para yield. Let's look at option D's order: 4 < 2 < 6. This corresponds to para yield: NO₂ < COOC₂H₅ < COOH.\n\n#### **Part 2: The Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para-Yield)**\n\nFor substances 1, 3, and 5, the yield of the para-isomer is primarily determined by steric hindrance. A larger substituent group will sterically block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-product.\n\n*   **Substituent Sizes:** The steric bulk of the groups increases in the order: -Cl < -CH₃ < -C₂H₅.\n    *   The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is significantly bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   A methyl group is generally considered sterically larger than a single chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Predicted Para-Yield Order:** Based on steric hindrance, the fraction of para-isomer should increase as the substituent size increases. Therefore, we expect the order of increasing para-yield to be:\n    Chlorobenzene (3) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\nThis prediction is supported by experimental data for similar reactions. For instance, in nitration, the para product percentages are approximately: Chlorobenzene (~70%), Toluene (~37%), and t-butylbenzene (a bulky alkyl group) (~75%). Note that the reaction conditions can influence these ratios, but the general trend related to sterics holds. The increased bulk of an alkyl group strongly favors para-substitution.\n\n### Combining the Rankings\n\nCombining the two groups, the meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors in order of increasing steric hindrance.\n\nThe full sequence should start with the meta-directors and end with the ortho, para-directors arranged by steric effect (3 < 1 < 5).\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) 4<6<2<**1<5<3** - The order for o,p-directors is incorrect.\n*   B) 6<2<4<**5<1<3** - The order for o,p-directors is incorrect.\n*   C) **3<5<1**... - Starts with an o,p-director, which is incorrect.\n*   D) 4<2<6<**3<1<5** - This option correctly places the meta-directors first and then correctly orders the ortho, para-directors based on increasing steric hindrance leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThus, the final order is determined by grouping the substances into meta- and ortho/para-directors and then arranging the latter based on the steric effect of the substituent.\n\n<<<D>>>"
