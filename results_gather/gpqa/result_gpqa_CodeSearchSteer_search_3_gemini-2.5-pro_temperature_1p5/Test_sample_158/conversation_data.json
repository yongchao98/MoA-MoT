    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the comoving distance to the quasar:\n\n### 1. Identify the Spectral Line and Calculate Redshift\n\nThe observation of a peak wavelength at 790 nm followed by a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths is a distinctive feature of a high-redshift quasar. The peak corresponds to the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line, which is redshifted into the near-infrared part of the spectrum. The flux drop at shorter wavelengths is due to the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium, known as the Lyman-alpha forest or the Gunn-Peterson trough.\n\nThe rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition is 121.567 nanometers (nm). The redshift (z) of the quasar can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n*   *1 + z = λ<sub>observed</sub> / λ<sub>rest</sub>*\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n*   *1 + z = 790 nm / 121.567 nm ≈ 6.498*\n*   *z ≈ 5.498*\n\n### 2. Calculate the Comoving Distance\n\nWith the redshift determined, the comoving distance can be calculated using the provided cosmological parameters of the Lambda-CDM model:\n*   Hubble constant (H₀) = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Matter density parameter (Ω<sub>m</sub>) = 0.3\n*   Dark energy density parameter (Ω<sub>Λ</sub>) = 0.7\n*   A flat universe (implying the curvature parameter Ω<sub>k</sub> = 0)\n\nThe comoving distance (D<sub>C</sub>) is calculated by integrating the Hubble parameter over redshift. For a flat universe, the formula is:\n\n*   D<sub>C</sub> = (c / H₀) * ∫[0 to z] dz' / sqrt(Ω<sub>m</sub>(1 + z')³ + Ω<sub>Λ</sub>)\n\nWhere *c* is the speed of light.\n\nUsing a cosmological calculator with a redshift of z ≈ 5.5 and the given cosmological parameters, the comoving radial distance is found to be approximately 8004 Mpc.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated comoving distance is approximately 8004 Megaparsecs (Mpc), which is equivalent to about 8 Gigaparsecs (Gpc). Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 6 Gpc\nB) 7 Gpc\nC) 8 Gpc\nD) 9 Gpc\n\nThe calculated value aligns with option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
