    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the reactions and chromatographic analysis to determine the number of peaks.\n\n### **Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is a ketone and is chiral, with the stereocenter at the C5 position having an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone to an alcohol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is already chiral, this reaction will produce a pair of diastereomers. The incoming hydride from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face, leading to two possible stereochemical outcomes at C3 (R or S), while the configuration at C5 remains (S).\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n\n### **Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral dicarbonyl compound.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which has a plane of symmetry and is achiral.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the product mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n\nApplying this to the mixture:\n*   The products from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will resolve into **two separate peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will elute separately, giving another peak.\n*   The products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (diols) have different structures and polarities and are expected to have different retention times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\nHPLC columns with a chiral stationary phase (CSP) create a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   A chiral column can distinguish between all five stereoisomers present in the mixture, as they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n\nAnalyzing the mixture with a chiral column:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated: **two peaks**.\n*   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II ((2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and the meso (2R, 4S) forms) will all be resolved from each other. The chiral column will separate the enantiomeric pair, and the meso compound, being a diastereomer to the others, will also have a unique retention time. This results in **three peaks**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 Peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
