    "My reasoning appears sound, and the search results confirm the key formulas used.\n\n1.  **Exoplanet Transit Depth**: The search results confirm that the transit depth is approximated by the ratio of the planet's radius (R_pl) to the star's radius (R_star), squared. As stated in multiple sources, `Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)^2`. This is the fractional drop in brightness caused by the planet blocking starlight.\n\n2.  **Starspot Brightness Variation**: While a single, neat formula for rotational modulation amplitude isn't presented in the snippets, the underlying physics I used is correct. The variation in brightness is due to cooler, dimmer regions (spots) rotating into and out of view. The total flux is the sum of contributions from the hot photosphere and the cooler spots. The flux from a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (the Stefan-Boltzmann law). Therefore, my method of calculating the flux from the unspotted hemisphere (F_max) and the spotted hemisphere (F_min) and then finding the relative amplitude `(F_max - F_min) / F_max` is physically correct.\n\nMy derived formula for the amplitude of the dip caused by the spotted hemisphere is:\n`Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\nwhere `f` is the spot filling factor, `T_spot` is the spot temperature, and `T_eff` is the stellar effective temperature.\n\nLet's re-verify the calculation.\n*   `f = 0.20`\n*   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n*   Amplitude = `0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)^4]`\n*   Amplitude = `0.20 * [1 - (5/6)^4]`\n*   Amplitude = `0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]`\n*   Amplitude = `0.20 * 0.51775`\n*   Amplitude = `0.10355`\n\nThis represents a ~10.36% drop in brightness when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible compared to the unspotted hemisphere.\n\nNow, we set this equal to the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet.\n*   `(R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.10355`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n*   `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nThe reasoning is consistent, the formulas are confirmed by the search, and the calculation is straightforward. The answer should be A.\n\nFinal check on the question's constraints:\n*   Star radius = Sun radius (doesn't affect the ratio R_pl/R_star)\n*   One hemisphere covered in spots (this is the basis for the min/max brightness scenario)\n*   Filling factor f=20% (0.2)\n*   Teff = 6000K, ΔT = 1000K -> Tspot = 5000K\n\nEverything has been used correctly. The problem simplifies to a comparison of flux deficits, one from temperature differences and one from an occulting area.\n\nThe signal amplitude due to spots is the fractional flux change between the maximum brightness (unspotted hemisphere view) and minimum brightness (spotted hemisphere view).\n\n*   Flux is proportional to Area × T⁴.\n*   `F_max` ∝ A * T_eff⁴\n*   `F_min` ∝ A * [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]\n*   Amplitude = `(F_max - F_min) / F_max` = `1 - F_min / F_max` = `1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]` = `f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\nThe signal amplitude from a transit (transit depth) is the fractional area blocked.\n*   Transit Depth = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nEquating the two amplitudes leads to the result `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32`.\n\nThe calculation is solid.\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.07\n\nMy result matches option A perfectly.\n\nFinal answer will be A.\nI'm confident in the calculation and the physical principles applied.\nNo more searches or calculations are needed.\nThe response will be the final answer format.\n<<<A>>>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the amplitude of the light variation caused by the rotating spotted star and then find the radius of a planet that would cause a transit of the same amplitude.\n\n**1. Calculate the brightness drop from the starspots.**\n\nThe flux (brightness) of a star or a part of a star is proportional to its area and the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law, F ∝ A * T⁴).\n\n*   Let the star's effective temperature be T_eff = 6000 K.\n*   The temperature of the spots is T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n*   The spot filling factor on the spotted hemisphere is f = 20% = 0.20.\n\nWe consider two cases for the observed flux:\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk has a temperature of T_eff. The flux is proportional to `A_disk * T_eff⁴`, where `A_disk` is the area of the star's visible disk.\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. 20% of the visible disk area is covered by spots (temperature T_spot) and the remaining 80% is at the normal photospheric temperature (T_eff).\n    *   Flux from the unspotted part: `(1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴`\n    *   Flux from the spotted part: `f * A_disk * T_spot⁴`\n    *   Total minimum flux is `F_min` ∝ `(1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴ + f * A_disk * T_spot⁴`\n\nThe amplitude of the signal due to rotational modulation is the fractional difference in flux:\nAmplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n= 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n= 1 - [((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]\n= 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n= f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\n= f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\nNow, plug in the values:\nAmplitude_spot = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 K / 6000 K)⁴]\nAmplitude_spot = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\nAmplitude_spot = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]\nAmplitude_spot = 0.20 * 0.51775\nAmplitude_spot ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the star's brightness dips by about 10.36% due to the spots.\n\n**2. Relate this amplitude to a transiting exoplanet.**\n\nThe signal produced by a transiting exoplanet is the transit depth, which is the fraction of the star's light blocked by the planet. This is approximately the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\nAmplitude_planet = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**3. Equate the two amplitudes and solve.**\n\nWe are looking for a hypothetical planet that produces the same signal amplitude as the starspots.\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude_spot\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nTherefore, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet would be about 0.32 times the radius of its host star to produce the same signal amplitude as the rotating starspots.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
