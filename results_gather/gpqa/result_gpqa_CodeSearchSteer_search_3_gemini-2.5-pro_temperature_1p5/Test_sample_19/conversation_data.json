    "### Key Assumptions of the Impulse Approximation\n\nThe \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations posits that the interaction of a probe with a nucleus can be treated as a sum of interactions with individual nucleons that behave as if they are free particles. This simplification is underpinned by several key assumptions.\n\nAn analysis of the provided options reveals that the core tenets of the impulse approximation are encapsulated by three of the four statements:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** This is the foundational principle of the impulse approximation. The complex many-body interaction is simplified to a series of two-body interactions between the probe and a single nucleon. The remaining nucleons in the nucleus are considered spectators to this primary interaction.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This assumption, often termed the \"transparency assumption,\" posits that the incoming probe interacts with the target nucleon without significant prior or subsequent interactions with the surrounding nuclear medium. This ensures that the probe reaches the nucleon and the outgoing particles can escape without significant distortion of their properties by the rest of the nucleus.\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** A crucial element of this approximation is that during the very short time of the interaction, the binding energy of the nucleon to the nucleus is considered negligible compared to the interaction energy. Consequently, the nucleon is treated as if it were a free particle at the moment of the collision.\n\nThe third option, regarding the non-relativistic nature of quarks internal to the nucleon, is not a fundamental assumption of the impulse approximation itself. The impulse approximation generally treats nucleons as elementary particles for the purpose of the interaction, abstracting away their internal quark-gluon structure. While more advanced models like the Relativistic Impulse Approximation exist, the non-relativistic motion of quarks is not a precondition for the basic impulse approximation.\n\nTherefore, the combination of assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are the interaction with a single nucleon, the transparency of the nucleus, and the neglect of nucleon binding forces during the interaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
