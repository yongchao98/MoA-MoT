    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided options to determine the correct reaction sequence for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3)\n*   A bromo group (-Br)\n*   A nitro group (-NO2)\n\nAll substituents are *meta* (1,3,5) to each other. To achieve this substitution pattern, the directing effects of the groups during the electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions must be carefully considered.\n\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**Evaluation of Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on established chemical principles:\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence begins with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline, diazotization, and then deamination. This series of steps (i through iv) would convert benzene to nitrobenzene and then back to benzene, which is an illogical circular path. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence starts with the bromination of benzene to form bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration (step ii) would yield a mixture of *ortho*-bromonitrobenzene and *para*-bromonitrobenzene. This does not create the required *meta* relationship between the substituents and is therefore an incorrect pathway.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins with nitration (i) to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline (ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3). However, Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on anilines. The basic lone pair on the nitrogen of the amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a positively charged complex that strongly deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Therefore, this sequence is not feasible. This rule also applies to strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene, which would make adding the acetyl group after the initial nitration difficult.\n\n*   **Option C:** Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This Friedel-Crafts acylation correctly places an acetyl group on the ring. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director for subsequent reactions.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position, resulting in 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one. This establishes the correct 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** Now, nitration is performed. The two existing groups direct the incoming nitro group. The acetyl group directs *meta* (to position 5), and the bromo group directs *ortho, para* (to positions 1, 3, and 5). Both groups direct the nitration to position 5, a reinforcing effect that leads to a high yield of the desired product.\n\nThe first three steps of this option provide a direct and chemically sound route to the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and would lead to undesired transformations. However, among the given choices, only Option C presents a valid and logical initial sequence to successfully synthesize the target compound with high yield.\n\n<<<C>>>"
