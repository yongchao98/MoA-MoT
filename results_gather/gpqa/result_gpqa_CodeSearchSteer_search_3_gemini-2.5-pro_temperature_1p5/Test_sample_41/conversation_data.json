    "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Establish the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit., This relationship can be expressed as:\n    `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n\n2.  **Determine the relationship between the orbital period and orbital distance.**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit.,, This can be written as:\n    `P² ∝ a³` or `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n\n3.  **Combine these relationships to link the orbital period and equilibrium temperature.**\n    From the temperature relationship, we can express the semi-major axis 'a' in terms of T_eq:\n    `a ∝ T_eq^(-2)`\n    By substituting this into Kepler's law, we can find the relationship between the period and the equilibrium temperature:\n    `P ∝ (T_eq^(-2))^(3/2)`\n    `P ∝ T_eq^(-3)`\n    This means the ratio of the orbital periods is `P3 / P1 = (T_eq3 / T_eq1)^(-3) = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet3.**\n    We are given the following ratios:\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4`\n    *   `T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3`\n\n    To find the ratio between Planet1 and Planet3, we multiply these two ratios:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) ≈ 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n\n5.  **Calculate the final ratio of the orbital periods.**\n    Using the relationship derived in step 3, we can now find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1:\n    `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³ ≈ (3.22)³`\n    `P3 / P1 ≈ 33.386`\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information provided about the planet masses and the specific albedo value is not needed for this calculation, as long as the albedo is the same for all three planets.\n\n<<<C>>>"
