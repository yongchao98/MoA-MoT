    "To determine the joint probability, we must analyze the initial and final states of the two-electron system.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State:**\nThe system is initially in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n*   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n*   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n*   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   $m = -1$ is the total magnetic quantum number, which corresponds to the z-component of the total angular momentum ($L_z$).\n\n**2. Understand the Measurement and Final State:**\nA measurement of the z-components of the individual angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We want to find the probability of obtaining the following specific outcomes:\n*   For the first electron ($L_{1z}$), the eigenvalue is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n*   For the second electron ($L_{2z}$), the eigenvalue is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nThis final measured state is described in the uncoupled basis as $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n**3. Apply the Conservation of the Z-Component of Angular Momentum:**\nA fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This is expressed in terms of the magnetic quantum numbers as:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nIn the initial state of the system, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\nFor the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be:\n$m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$\n\nSince the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state (m = -1) does not equal the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the measured state (-2), this measurement outcome violates the law of conservation of angular momentum.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability:**\nThe probability of measuring a certain outcome is given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which connects the coupled state to the uncoupled state. Specifically, the probability is $|<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n\nBecause the condition $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transition is zero. This means that the expansion of the coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ into the uncoupled basis does not contain the term $|1, -1; 1, -1>$. The only terms present in the expansion must satisfy $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$, which are combinations like $|1, 0; 1, -1>$ and $|1, -1; 1, 0>$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of obtaining a measurement where $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ both have eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
