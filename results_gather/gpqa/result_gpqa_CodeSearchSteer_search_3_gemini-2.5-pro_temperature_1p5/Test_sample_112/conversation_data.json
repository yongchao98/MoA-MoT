    "To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Paired with the O-H peak, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   The combination of these peaks points to a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an alkene group, i.e., an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinylic protons typically appear in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of an NMR spectrum. This supports the conclusion drawn from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n### Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe degree of unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The presence of a carboxylic acid (which contains one C=O bond) and an alkene (one C=C bond) means the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each of the possible formulas, using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens (oxygens do not affect the calculation).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n1.  **Functional Groups:** The data confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n2.  **Oxygen Atoms:** A carboxylic acid functional group requires two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options B (C₆H₁₀O) and C (C₆H₁₂O).\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation:** The presence of both a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene (C=C) requires two degrees of unsaturation. This eliminates option D (C₆H₁₂O₂), which only has one degree of unsaturation.\n\nOnly the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** (Option A) satisfies all the conditions: it contains two oxygen atoms necessary for a carboxylic acid and has two degrees of unsaturation, accounting for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
