    "To determine the probability that a measurement of the observable P will yield the value 0, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics. The probability is calculated as the squared magnitude of the inner product of the normalized state vector and the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of interest.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Define the State Vector and the Observable Operator**\n\n*   The state of the system at time t, `|ψ⟩`, is given by the column matrix:\n    ```\n    [-1]\n    [ 2]\n    [ 1]\n    ```\n*   The observable of the system, `P`, is represented by the matrix:\n    ```\n    [ 0,   1/√2,   0 ]\n    [ 1/√2, 0,    1/√2]\n    [ 0,   1/√2,   0 ]\n    ```\n\n**2. Normalize the State Vector**\n\nThe state vector must be normalized. The squared norm `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is the sum of the squares of its elements.\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n*   The normalization constant is `1/√6`.\n*   The normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is:\n    ```\n      (1/√6) * [-1]\n              [ 2]\n              [ 1]\n    ```\n\n**3. Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Observable**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`. First, let's find all eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`:\n\n*   `det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ], [ 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ], [ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]]) = 0`\n*   Expanding the determinant gives: `-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0`\n*   This simplifies to: `-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = 0`\n*   Factoring out λ gives: `λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n*   The eigenvalues are `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`.\n\nNow, we find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` for the eigenvalue `λ = 0` by solving `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩ = 0`. Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]`:\n*   The matrix equation `P|v₀⟩=0` gives the system of linear equations:\n    1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n*   The eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. Choosing `x = 1`, we get the un-normalized eigenvector `[1, 0, -1]`.\n\n**4. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nThe eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 must also be normalized.\n*   The squared norm is `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`.\n*   The normalization constant is `1/√2`.\n*   The normalized eigenvector for `λ=0`, `|λ₀⟩`, is:\n    ```\n    (1/√2) * [ 1]\n            [ 0]\n            [-1]\n    ```\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability**\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the normalized state vector onto the normalized eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue, `P(λ) = |⟨λᵢ|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n\n*   `⟨λ₀|ψ_norm⟩ = ((1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]) · ((1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1])`\n*   `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n*   `= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n\nNow, square the magnitude of this result to find the probability:\n*   `P(0) = | -1/√3 |² = 1/3`\n\nTherefore, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
