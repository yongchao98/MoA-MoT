    "To determine the numerical value of \"a,\" we must use the normalization condition for the wave function. The Born rule states that the square of the modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|², represents the probability density of finding the particle at a specific position. Since the particle is guaranteed to be somewhere in the allowed region, the integral of this probability density over all possible positions must equal 1.\n\nThe given wave function is:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe squared modulus, |ψ(x)|², is calculated as the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts:\n|ψ(x)|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]²\n|ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + [-0.5]²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the normalization integral is set up over this interval:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nTo solve this, we integrate the expression term by term:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx\n\nThe integral of the first term is a² * ln(1 + x). The integral of the second term is 0.25 * x.\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n[a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x] from 1 to 3\n= (a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3) - (a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1)\n= (a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25)\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\nUsing the logarithm property ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c), this simplifies to:\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\nFinally, we set this result equal to 1, as per the normalization condition:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2 (ln(2) ≈ 0.693):\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\n\nNow, we take the square root to find \"a\":\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.8494\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<B>>>"
