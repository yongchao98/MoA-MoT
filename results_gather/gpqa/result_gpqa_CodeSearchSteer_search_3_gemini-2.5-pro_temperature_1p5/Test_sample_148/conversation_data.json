    "### Analysis of the Observations\n\n1.  **¹H NMR Data**: The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar, but not identical, chemical shifts and their combined integral matches the expected value for one proton. The fact that these are two separate signals for what should be one type of proton indicates the presence of at least two different molecular species in the sample. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the difference must arise from a difference in the chemical environment of the proton in these two species.\n\n2.  **LC-MS Data**: The analysis reveals two separate peaks in the liquid chromatogram, both of which exhibit the same mass spectrum. A mass spectrometer cannot typically distinguish between stereoisomers as they have the same mass. The identical mass confirms that the two species are isomers of the expected compound, not a precursor or an impurity with a different molecular formula. The separation into two peaks by liquid chromatography (LC) is a key piece of information.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**: This is unlikely. A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight, leading to a different mass spectrum for one of the LC peaks. The data shows both peaks have a mass spectrum consistent with the final product.\n\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**: This term usually implies an undesired side reaction where an extra amino acid is added. This would create a product with a significantly higher mass, which is inconsistent with the LC-MS results showing both peaks have the expected mass.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are chemically indistinguishable and produce identical NMR spectra. Therefore, a mixture of enantiomers would show only a single peak for the alpha-proton, not two. Similarly, to separate enantiomers by LC, a special chiral stationary phase is required. While not explicitly stated that an achiral column was used, it is the standard for general analysis. More importantly, this option is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **NMR Spectroscopy**: Because they are chemically distinct, corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers (like the alpha-proton in this case) are in non-equivalent chemical environments and are expected to have different chemical shifts. This perfectly explains the observation of two peaks for the alpha-proton. Studies on peptide synthesis have used NMR to quantify diastereomeric mixtures resulting from racemization.\n    *   **LC-MS**: Due to their different physical properties, diastereomers can often be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. The observation of two LC peaks with identical mass spectra strongly supports the presence of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined evidence from both ¹H NMR (two signals for a single proton) and LC-MS (two separable peaks with identical mass) points overwhelmingly to the presence of a mixture of diastereoisomers. Such a mixture could arise during peptide synthesis through racemization of one of the chiral amino acid building blocks, which would create a diastereomer of the intended peptide. Another possibility in peptides is the formation of atropisomers, which are stereoisomers resulting from hindered rotation around a single bond and also behave as diastereomers if another chiral center is present. Both racemization and atropisomerism are known phenomena in peptide chemistry that lead to diastereomeric mixtures.\n\n<<<D>>>"
