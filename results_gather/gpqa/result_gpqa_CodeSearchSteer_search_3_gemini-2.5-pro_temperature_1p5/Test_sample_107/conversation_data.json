    "To compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the given transition energy, we need to calculate both values.\n\n### 1. Paramagnetic Coupling Term (`⟨H⟩`)\n\nThe energy of the paramagnetic coupling, also known as the Zeeman effect, is given by the formula:\n\n`⟨H⟩ = m * μ_B * B`\n\nwhere:\n*   `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem specifies using a small value for `m`, so we will use `m = 1`.\n*   `B` is the magnetic field strength, given as `1 T`.\n*   `μ_B` is the Bohr magneton.\n\nThe value of the Bohr magneton is approximately `μ_B ≈ 5.788 x 10^-5 eV/T`.\n\nNow, we can calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy:\n\n```latex\n\\langle H\\rangle = 1 \\cdot (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\cdot 1 \\text{ T}\n```\n\n```latex\n\\langle H\\rangle = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}\n```\n\n### 2. Transition Energy (`ΔE`)\n\nThe energy of a photon emitted during an electron transition is related to its wavelength (`λ`) by the formula:\n\n`ΔE = h * c / λ`\n\nwhere:\n*   `λ` is the wavelength, given as `0.4861 μm` or `0.4861 x 10^-6 m`. The wavelength 486.1 nm corresponds to the beta line of the Balmer series in the hydrogen spectrum (transition from n=4 to n=2).\n*   `h` is the Planck constant. Its value is approximately `h ≈ 4.136 x 10^-15 eV·s`.\n*   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum. Its value is approximately `c ≈ 3 x 10^8 m/s`.\n\nNow we can calculate the transition energy:\n\n```latex\n\\Delta E = \\frac{(4.136 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{s}) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}\n```\n\n```latex\n\\Delta E = \\frac{12.408 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{m}}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}\n```\n\n```latex\n\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}\n```\n\n### 3. Comparison\n\nNow we compare the orders of magnitude of the two energies:\n\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: `⟨H⟩ ≈ 5.788 x 10^-5 eV`\n*   Transition energy: `ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV`\n\nTo compare them, we can take their ratio:\n\n```latex\n\\frac{\\langle H\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.55 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}\n```\n\nThis ratio is very small, which clearly shows that the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that `⟨H⟩` is much less than `ΔE`.\n\n`⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE`\n\n<<<C>>>"
