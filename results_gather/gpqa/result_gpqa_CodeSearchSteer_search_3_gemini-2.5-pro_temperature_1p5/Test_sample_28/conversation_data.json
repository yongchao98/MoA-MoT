    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, the most effective mutation would be one that completely inactivates the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is best achieved by a mutation that results in a non-functional or severely shortened protein. Let's analyze the effects of the mutations in the given mutants.\n\nThe genetic code is read in triplets of nucleotides called codons, where each codon specifies a particular amino acid or a stop signal. The process begins at a \"start\" codon (`ATG`) and ends at a \"stop\" codon (`TGA`, `TAA`, or `TAG`).\n\n*   **Intact Gene Analysis**: The initial sequence is `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`.\n    *   `ATG` is the start codon for Methionine.\n    *   `TTT` codes for Phenylalanine.\n    *   `CTC` codes for Leucine.\n\n*   **Mutant 1 Analysis**: The sequence is `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`.\n    *   This represents a change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This type of mutation, which results in a different amino acid, is called a **missense mutation**. While a missense mutation can sometimes render a protein non-functional, it might also only slightly alter it or have no effect at all, making it less reliable for completely eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 2 Analysis**: The sequence is `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`.\n    *   Here, the codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is one of the three **stop codons**.\n    *   This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely. The resulting protein would be only two amino acids long (Methionine-Phenylalanine), which would be completely non-functional. This is a very effective way to \"knock out\" a gene's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3 Analysis**: The sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...` compared to the intact `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTT...` suggests a significant change. A plausible interpretation is a single nucleotide insertion, which would cause a **frameshift mutation**. A frameshift alters the three-letter codon reading frame, changing all subsequent amino acids and often leading to a premature stop codon. Like a nonsense mutation, a frameshift is highly likely to produce a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 4 Analysis**: Comparing `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGT...` with the intact gene suggests the deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion**, meaning one amino acid (Glycine) is removed without altering the reading frame. This is less likely to be as detrimental as a nonsense or frameshift mutation and may only partially affect the protein's function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth nonsense (Mutant 2) and frameshift (Mutant 3) mutations are very likely to eliminate the protein's function. However, the mutation in Mutant 2 is definitively a nonsense mutation that introduces a stop codon at the third position. This guarantees the production of a severely truncated, non-functional protein. Therefore, it is the most certain and direct way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound among the choices provided.\n\n<<<B>>>"
