    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides the most direct clues to the number and types of hydrogen atoms in the molecule, which is essential for determining the chemical formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic Hydrogens:** The spectrum shows two signals corresponding to aromatic hydrogens. A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring) has four hydrogen atoms attached to it (C₆H₄). The presence of only two signals for these four protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para) substitution.\n    *   Number of aromatic hydrogens = 4\n\n*   **Vinyl Hydrogens:** There are two signals for vinyl hydrogens (-CH=CH-). The splitting patterns (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) are characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃), where the two vinyl protons split each other, and one is further split by the adjacent methyl group.\n    *   Number of vinyl hydrogens = 2\n\n*   **Methyl Hydrogens (-CH₃):** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl groups. One methyl group is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH₃**) identified above. The other methyl group must be part of the ester functionality.\n    *   Number of hydrogens in two -CH₃ groups = 2 × 3 = 6\n\n*   **Methylene Hydrogens (-CH₂):** The problem explicitly states there are no signals for -CH₂ groups.\n    *   Number of methylene hydrogens = 0\n\n### 2. Calculating the Total Number of Hydrogens\n\nBy summing the hydrogens from each part of the molecule identified by the ¹H NMR spectrum, we can find the total number of hydrogens in the molecular formula.\n\n*   Total Hydrogens = (Aromatic H) + (Vinyl H) + (Methyl H)\n*   Total Hydrogens = 4 + 2 + 6 = **12**\n\nThis calculation immediately eliminates options C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) and D (C₁₁H₁₄O₂), as they both contain 14 hydrogen atoms. The correct formula must be either C₁₁H₁₂O₂ or C₁₂H₁₂O₂.\n\n### 3. Assembling the Molecular Structure to Count Carbons\n\nNow, let's determine the number of carbon atoms by piecing together the structural fragments.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A benzene ring contributes 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester group (-COO-), which contains 1 carbon atom.\n*   **Molecular Skeleton from ¹H NMR:**\n    *   The two vinyl hydrogens belong to two carbon atoms (-**C**H=**C**H-).\n    *   The two methyl groups contribute two more carbon atoms (2 × -**C**H₃).\n\nLet's sum the carbon atoms from these identified fragments:\n\n*   Total Carbons = (Aromatic Ring C) + (Ester C) + (Vinyl C) + (Methyl C)\n*   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **11**\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis leads to a molecule containing 11 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms (from the ester group).\n\n*   **Carbon atoms:** 11\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** 12\n*   **Oxygen atoms:** 2\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis corresponds to structures like *methyl p-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate* or *p-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate*, both of which fit all the spectral data provided.\n\n<<<A>>>"
