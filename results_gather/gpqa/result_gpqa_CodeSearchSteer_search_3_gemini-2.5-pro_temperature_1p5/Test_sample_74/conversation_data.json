    "To identify the reason for the failed protein expression, a careful analysis of the provided DNA sequence is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of the DNA Sequence\n\nThe provided plus-strand DNA sequence is:\n`5'-ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGC...`\n\nThe goal was to create a fusion protein with an HA tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G protein. Let's break down the sequence based on this information:\n\n1.  **Start Codon:** Protein translation begins at a start codon, which is typically `ATG` and codes for Methionine. The sequence correctly begins with `ATG`.\n2.  **HA-Tag Sequence:** The influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag has the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA. The DNA sequence immediately following the start codon is `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`. Let's translate this:\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    This DNA sequence correctly codes for the YPYDVPDYA peptide. There are no mutations within the tag-coding sequence itself.\n3.  **Junction and GADD45G Sequence:** The rest of the sequence should correspond to the GADD45G gene. Let's examine the nucleotides immediately following the HA-tag sequence (`...GCC`):\n    *   The sequence continues with `AAATGACTCT...`\n    *   To understand what the ribosome does, we must read the sequence in triplets (codons) from the beginning.\n    *   The codons are read as: `ATG TAC CCA ... TAC GCC AAA TGA...`\n4.  **Identifying the \"Annoying\" Error:**\n    *   After the final codon of the HA-tag, `GCC` (Alanine), the very next codon is `AAA`, which codes for Lysine.\n    *   The codon immediately following `AAA` is `TGA`.\n    *   `TGA` is one of the three universal stop codons (along with `UGA`, `UAA`, and `UAG` in mRNA) that signal the ribosome to terminate translation.\n\nThe ribosome, therefore, initiates translation at `ATG`, synthesizes the HA-tag and one additional amino acid (Lysine), and then immediately encounters the `TGA` stop codon. This halts protein synthesis, resulting in a tiny, non-functional peptide of only 12 amino acids. This premature termination is the reason the full-length protein cannot be detected.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is precisely what the sequence analysis shows. An in-frame `TGA` stop codon appears right after the HA-tag sequence.\n*   **B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can be important, their absence is not a direct cause of failed translation that can be deduced from the sequence alone, nor is it as definitive a failure as a stop codon.\n*   **C) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect. The DNA sequence provided for the HA tag correctly codes for the standard `YPYDVPDYA` amino acid sequence.\n*   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement is biologically incorrect. `UAA` is a stop codon for which no tRNA exists; instead, release factors bind to it to terminate translation. Furthermore, the premature stop codon in this sequence is `TGA`, not `UAA`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
