    "The quantum mechanical system described is a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula:\n\n$E_N = (N + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\nwhere $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, with $n_x, n_y, n_z$ being non-negative integers.\n\nThe different energy levels are determined by the value of N:\n*   **Ground state:** N = 0. The energy is $E_0 = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First excited state:** N = 1. The energy is $E_1 = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second excited state:** N = 2. The energy is $E_2 = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third excited state:** N = 3. The energy is $E_3 = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level, which is its degeneracy. The degeneracy, $g_N$, for a given N is the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is N. The formula for the degeneracy is:\n\n$g_N = (N+1)(N+2)/2$\n\nFor the third excited state, N = 3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n\n$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$.\n\nThe possible combinations of ($n_x, n_y, n_z$) that sum to 3 are:\n*   (3, 0, 0) and its 2 permutations: (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — (3 states)\n*   (2, 1, 0) and its 5 permutations: (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — (6 states)\n*   (1, 1, 1) — (1 state)\n\nThe total number of states is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10. Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is the one that has an energy of $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$ and a degeneracy of 10.\n\n<<<B>>>"
