    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n1.  **Formula for Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq)**\n    The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n2.  **Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n    We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both. It also specifies that we should assume the same albedo for both planets (A1 = A2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1 / a1)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a2)^(1/2)]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n    To solve the problem, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2/a1.\n\n3.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\n    The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The maximum RV shift of the star, K (also known as the RV semi-amplitude), is related to the planet's properties. For a circular orbit and assuming the inclination `i` is ~90° (a good assumption for planets detected via the transit method), the formula for K is:\n    K = M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))\n    Where:\n    *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n    K² = M_p² * (G / (a * M_star))\n    a = (M_p² * G) / (K² * M_star)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1)**\n    Using the formula for `a`, we can find the ratio a2 / a1:\n    a2 / a1 = [(M_p2² * G) / (K2² * M_star)] / [(M_p1² * G) / (K1² * M_star)]\n\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) / (M_p1² / K1²)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n5.  **Plugging in the Values**\n    First, let's find the ratio of the masses:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    Next, let's find the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes (K). The value of K is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ).\n    *   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n    *   K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n    Now, substitute these ratios into the equation for a2 / a1:\n    a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n6.  **Final Calculation of the Temperature Ratio**\n    Finally, substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n    This value is approximately 0.53.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe calculated ratio is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
