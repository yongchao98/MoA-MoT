    "To determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule, a systematic approach is required, following the official nomenclature rules.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Compound\nThe molecule is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group, which is a principal functional group. This makes the parent compound **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the carboxylic acid is assigned position C1.\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure from the Description\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring according to the given relative positions:\n*   **-COOH (Carboxylic acid)** is at C1.\n*   **-OCH₃ (Methoxy)** is para to the carboxylic acid, so it must be at C4.\n*   **-CHO (Carbaldehyde/Formyl)** and **-CN (Cyano)** are both meta to the carboxylic acid, placing them at C3 and C5. They are also meta to each other, which is consistent with these positions.\n*   **-OH (Hydroxyl/Alcohol)** and **-N(CH₃)₂ (Dimethylamino)** are ortho to the carboxylic acid, placing them at C2 and C6.\n*   The description provides two final constraints to lock in the positions:\n    *   The methoxy group (at C4) is ortho to the nitrile (cyano group). This works whether the cyano group is at C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group) is also ortho to the nitrile. If the cyano group is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by the methoxy group, the hydroxyl group must be at C6. This then places the dimethylamino group at C2. If we tried placing the cyano group at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. For the hydroxyl to be ortho, it would have to be at C2, placing dimethylamino at C6. Both scenarios result in the same molecule, just viewed from a different rotation.\n\nThis confirms a single, unique structure.\n\n### 3. Number the Substituents According to IUPAC Rules\nFor polysubstituted benzoic acid, the carboxylic acid group defines C1. The ring is then numbered to give the other substituents the lowest possible set of locants. If the two possible numbering directions (clockwise and counter-clockwise) result in the same set of locants, the tie is broken by giving the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n*   **Fixed Positions:** C1: -COOH, C4: -OCH₃\n*   **Possible Numbering 1 (Clockwise from C1):**\n    *   C2: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n    *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   *Locant set: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6*\n*   **Possible Numbering 2 (Counter-clockwise from C1):**\n    *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n    *   *Locant set: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6*\n\nSince both numbering schemes yield the identical locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, the tie must be broken by alphabetical priority.\n\n### 4. Alphabetize Substituents and Assign Final Name\nThe substituents are: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, and methoxy.\n\n*   Alphabetical Order: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n\nNow we compare the two numbering possibilities to see which one assigns a lower number to the first substituent alphabetically (\"cyano\").\n*   Numbering 1 (Clockwise) places \"cyano\" at C5.\n*   Numbering 2 (Counter-clockwise) places \"cyano\" at C3.\n\nNumbering 2 is correct because it gives the alphabetically first substituent the lower number (3 vs. 5).\n\nUsing this correct numbering, the final positions are:\n*   C2: -hydroxy\n*   C3: -cyano\n*   C4: -methoxy\n*   C5: -formyl\n*   C6: -dimethylamino\n\nThe complete IUPAC name is constructed by listing the substituents in alphabetical order with their assigned numbers, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\nThe correct name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
