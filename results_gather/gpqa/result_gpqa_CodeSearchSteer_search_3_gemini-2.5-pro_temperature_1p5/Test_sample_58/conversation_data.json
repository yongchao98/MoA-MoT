    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we will perform a step-by-step analysis of the neutralization reactions.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant:**\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH, a weak acid):**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl, a strong acid):**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n    Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂, a strong base):**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that provides two hydroxide ions per formula unit, the moles of OH⁻ ions are:\n    Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) first. Then, any remaining strong base will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    The H⁺ ions are the limiting reactant. They will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base + Weak Acid**\n    CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n    The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Determine the final composition and calculate the pH:**\nAfter all the reactions, the solution contains a significant amount of excess strong base (OH⁻). The presence of this strong base will be the primary factor determining the pH of the solution. The contribution from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is negligible in comparison.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    pH = 14 - pOH\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is approximately 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
