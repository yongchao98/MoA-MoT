    "In a universe where isolated magnetic poles (magnetic monopoles) exist, two of the fundamental Maxwell's equations would need to be modified.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes:\n\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (Divergence of the magnetic field):** In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (∇ ⋅ B = 0). This is the mathematical expression of the fact that magnetic poles always come in pairs (north and south), and thus magnetic field lines are always closed loops. If magnetic monopoles existed, they would act as sources or sinks of the magnetic field, much like electric charges do for the electric field. Consequently, this equation would change to show that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the magnetic charge density (∇ ⋅ B = ρₘ).\n\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction (Circulation of the electric field):** The existence of magnetic monopoles would imply the possibility of a \"magnetic current,\" which is the flow of these magnetic charges. To maintain the symmetry of Maxwell's equations, a moving magnetic monopole or a magnetic current would have to induce a circulating electric field, just as an electric current induces a circulating magnetic field (Ampère's Law). This would add a magnetic current term (Jₘ) to Faraday's Law, modifying the equation for the circulation (or curl) of the electric field (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - Jₘ).\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be different are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the one related to the circulation of the electric field.\n\n<<<D>>>"
