    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under a specific set of idealized conditions. Analyzing the provided options based on the fundamental assumptions of the Mott-Gurney law reveals the correct statement.\n\nThe key assumptions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation are:\n*   **Single-carrier device**: The model assumes that only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is mobile and contributes to the current.\n*   **Trap-free solid**: The basic equation does not account for charge carriers being trapped in defect states within the semiconductor. The presence of traps would alter the current-voltage relationship.\n*   **Ohmic contact (no injection barrier)**: The electrode that injects charge carriers is assumed to be an ideal Ohmic contact. This means it can supply an unlimited number of carriers, so the current is limited by the transport through the material (the space charge) rather than by the injection process itself. This is also described as the electric field at the injecting electrode being zero. A Schottky contact, which has an energy barrier, violates this condition.\n*   **Negligible diffusion current**: The current is assumed to be dominated by the drift of carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The current arising from the diffusion of carriers due to concentration gradients is considered negligible.\n\nLet's evaluate the options against these criteria:\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the model assumes a single-carrier device.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect because the current is fundamentally a drift current; it is the diffusion current that is considered negligible.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because a Schottky contact creates an injection barrier, violating the assumption of an ideal Ohmic contact.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement correctly combines all the key assumptions: a single mobile carrier type, no traps, no barrier to injection (Ohmic contact), and drift-dominated current (negligible diffusion).\n\n<<<D>>>"
