    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical structure from the given options.\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to the dimeric hydrogen bonding characteristic of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, and its position is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n\nThe FTIR data strongly suggests that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group, so this information confirms the functional group type but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the isomers lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. We must identify the structure that can produce both of the following signals:\n\n1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This means the proton giving this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a group of one proton (giving the doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (giving the triplet), and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet).\n2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This means the proton for this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a group of one proton (doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (first triplet), and another group of two equivalent protons (second triplet).\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the protons on the main carbon chain of each candidate structure.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:** This structure does not possess protons that would simultaneously give both a dtq and a dtt signal. For instance, the proton beta to the COOH group would be a doublet of triplets of quartets (coupled to one H, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group), but there is no proton that would result in a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** Let's expand the structure and label the key protons:\n    **CH₃(a)-CH(b)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(e)(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂(h)-COOH**\n\n    *   **Proton H(b):**\n        *   Coupled to one proton, H(e), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   Coupled to the two protons of the adjacent CH₂(h) group (from the C₂H₅ substituent), resulting in a **triplet**.\n        *   Coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group, CH₃(a), resulting in a **quartet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for **H(b)** is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal description.\n\n    *   **Proton H(e):**\n        *   Coupled to one proton, H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   Coupled to the two protons of its own ethyl side chain (the CH₂ group), resulting in a **triplet**.\n        *   Coupled to the two protons of the methylene group, CH₂(h), which is alpha to the carbonyl, resulting in another **triplet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for **H(e)** is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal description.\n    This structure accounts for both of the complex splitting patterns observed.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:** The proton beta to the COOH group would give a doublet of triplets of triplets. However, no proton in this molecule would produce a doublet of triplets of quartets.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:** The proton beta to the COOH group would be a doublet of triplets of quartets. However, there is no proton that would result in a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed ¹H NMR analysis, only structure **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH** contains protons that would produce both a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\". Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
