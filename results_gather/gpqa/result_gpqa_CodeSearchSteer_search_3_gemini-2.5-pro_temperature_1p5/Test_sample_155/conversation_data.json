    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the subsequent chromatographic observations:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning both oxygen-carbon bonds form on the same face of the double bond. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene is retained in the product. Treating (E)-oct-4-ene (a *trans*-alkene) with mCPBA results in a *trans*-epoxide. Because the attack can occur from either face of the alkene with equal probability, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is formed.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition, meaning the nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   Attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a single, achiral *meso* compound.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to (Z)-oct-4-ene (a *cis*-alkene) forms a *cis*-epoxide. Due to the symmetry of the starting material and the nature of the addition, the resulting epoxide is a *meso* compound, (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The *anti*-addition of water to this *meso*-epoxide results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.\n    *   Attack at one carbon of the meso-epoxide yields (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon yields (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    These two products are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, forming a racemic mixture.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture Analysis**\n\nThe chemist combines the product of Reaction 1 (the *meso*-diol) with the products of Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols). The final mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (*meso*)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (*enantiomer*)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (*enantiomer*)\n\n### **Chromatographic Observation**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity, but it cannot differentiate between enantiomers.\n    *   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   The *meso*-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved enantiomeric pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This method uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-enantiomers into two separate peaks.\n    *   The *meso* compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also elute separately.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist observes 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
