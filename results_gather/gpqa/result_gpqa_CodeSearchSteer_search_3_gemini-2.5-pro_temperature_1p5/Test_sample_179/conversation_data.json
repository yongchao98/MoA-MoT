    "The minimum energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges. The system consists of a central charge and 12 charges on a spherical surface. For the total energy to be at a minimum, the 12 charges on the sphere must arrange themselves to have the maximum possible separation from each other. This configuration is known as the solution to the \"Thomson Problem\" for N=12, which is a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy (U) of this system is the sum of two components:\n1.  The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge (q_c) and the 12 charges on the sphere (q_s).\n2.  The potential energy from the mutual interaction among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n**1. Energy of Interaction between Central Charge and Spherical Charges (U_center_sphere)**\n\nEach of the 12 charges on the sphere is at a distance R = 2 m from the central charge. All charges are identical, with `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge.\nThe potential energy for this part is:\n`U_center_sphere = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\nwhere `k` is Coulomb's constant.\n\n**2. Energy of Interaction among Spherical Charges (U_sphere_sphere)**\n\nThe 12 charges form a regular icosahedron on the sphere of radius R. In an icosahedron, the distances between any vertex and the others are:\n*   5 adjacent vertices at a distance `a` (the edge length of the icosahedron).\n*   5 other vertices at a distance `a*φ` (where `φ` is the golden ratio, approximately 1.618).\n*   1 diametrically opposite vertex at a distance of `2R`.\n\nThe total potential energy is the sum of the energies of all 66 pairs of charges on the sphere. This can be calculated as:\n`U_sphere_sphere = (k * q^2) * [30/a + 30/(a*φ) + 6/(2R)]`\n\nCombining these terms and relating the icosahedron edge length `a` to the circumradius `R` (`a = 2R / sqrt(1+φ^2)`), the total energy `U` can be expressed as:\n`U = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere`\n`U = (k * q^2 / R) * [12 + (15 * φ * sqrt(1 + φ^2) + 3)]`\n`U ≈ (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + 49.165)`\n`U ≈ 61.165 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\n**3. Numerical Calculation**\n\nUsing the standard values for the physical constants:\n*   Coulomb's constant (`k`) ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²\n*   Elementary charge (`e`) ≈ 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C\n*   Charge of each particle (`q`) = 2e ≈ 3.204 × 10⁻¹⁹ C\n*   Radius (`R`) = 2 m\n\nPlugging these values into the energy equation:\n`q² ≈ (3.204 × 10⁻¹⁹)² ≈ 1.0267 × 10⁻³⁷ C²`\n`U ≈ 61.165 * (8.98755 × 10⁹ * 1.0267 × 10⁻³⁷ / 2)`\n`U ≈ 61.165 * (4.614 × 10⁻²⁸)`\n`U ≈ 2.8226 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nThis value, when rounded to three decimal places, is 2.823 x 10⁻²⁶ J. Option B is 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ J. The minor difference can be attributed to the precision of the constants used or rounding conventions. Given the available options, this result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
