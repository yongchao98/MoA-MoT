    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n    The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. As the star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of the planet, the light we receive from it is alternately blueshifted (when moving towards us) and redshifted (when moving away). The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity, also known as the velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\n    Therefore, we can establish a ratio:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n2.  **Relating Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n\n    K ≈ (2πG)^(1/3) * (mₚ / Mₛ^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3))\n\n    where:\n    *   mₚ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   Mₛ is the mass of the star.\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Simplifying the Relationship**\n    The problem states that the masses of the two stars are identical (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂) and the masses of the two planets are also similar (mₚ₁ = mₚ₂). Since G is a constant, most of the terms in the equation are the same for both systems. This simplifies the relationship to a direct proportionality:\n\n    K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Period Ratio**\n    We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (1 / P₁^(1/3)) / (1 / P₂^(1/3))\n    K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n    We want to find the ratio P₂ / P₁, so we rearrange the equation:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n5.  **Substituting the Given Values**\n    We know the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is the same as the ratio of their measured wavelength shifts:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 miliangstrom / 7 miliangstrom = 5/7\n\n    Now, substitute this value back into the equation for the period ratio:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5/7)³\n    P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result shows that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
