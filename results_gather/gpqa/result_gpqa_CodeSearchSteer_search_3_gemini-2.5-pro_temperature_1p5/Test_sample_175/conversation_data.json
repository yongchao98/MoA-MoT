    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to find the required probability:\n\n1.  **Normalize the initial state vector**:\n    The initial state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)`.\n    First, we need to find the norm of this state vector:\n    `||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n    The normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is therefore:\n    `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)`\n\n2.  **Find the eigenvector of P for the eigenvalue 0**:\n    The operator P is given by the matrix:\n    ```\n    P = [[0, 1/√2, 0],\n         [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n         [0, 1/√2, 0]]\n    ```\n    To find the eigenvector `|p_0⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ=0`, we solve the equation `P|p_0⟩ = 0|p_0⟩`. Let `|p_0⟩ = (x, y, z)`.\n    This gives the system of equations:\n    *   `y/√2 = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    *   `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` => `x = -z`\n    So, an unnormalized eigenvector is `(1, 0, -1)`.\n    Normalizing this eigenvector: `√(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = √2`.\n    The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is `|p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0**:\n    The probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for the observable P is given by `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n    `⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)] ⋅ [(1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)]`\n    `= (1/√12) * [1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1] = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\n    `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`.\n\n4.  **State collapse after the measurement of P**:\n    After measuring P and obtaining the result 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|p_0⟩`. The new state of the system is `|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)`.\n\n5.  **Find the eigenvector of Q for the eigenvalue -1**:\n    The operator Q is given by the diagonal matrix:\n    ```\n    Q = [[1, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, -1]]\n    ```\n    The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements: `1, 0, -1`. The corresponding normalized eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue `λ=-1` is `|q_-1⟩ = (0, 0, 1)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1 in the new state**:\n    The probability of measuring the eigenvalue -1 for Q in the state `|ψ'⟩` is given by `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩|²`.\n    `⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩ = (0, 0, 1) ⋅ [(1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)]`\n    `= (1/√2) * [0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)] = -1/√2`\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the total probability**:\n    The probability of measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1 is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the previous steps.\n    `Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`\n    `= (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\nThe final probability is 1/6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
