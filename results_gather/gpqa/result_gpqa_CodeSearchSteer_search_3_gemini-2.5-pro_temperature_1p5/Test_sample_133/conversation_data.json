    "To solve this problem, we must first determine the amount of acid (H⁺ ions) and base (OH⁻ ions) that will react. Then, we can calculate the heat released during their neutralization.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Moles of H⁺ Ions\n\n*   **From HCl:** Hydrochloric acid is a strong monoprotic acid (provides one H⁺ ion per molecule).\n    *   Moles of HCl = Volume × Molarity = 0.500 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Moles of H⁺ from HCl = 0.10 mol\n\n*   **From H₂SO₄:** Sulfuric acid is a strong diprotic acid (provides two H⁺ ions per molecule).\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = Volume × Molarity = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = 0.09 mol × 2 = 0.18 mol\n\n*   **Total Moles of H⁺:**\n    *   Total H⁺ = 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol\n\n### 2. Calculate the Moles of OH⁻ Ions\n\n*   **From Ba(OH)₂:** Barium hydroxide is a strong base that provides two OH⁻ ions per formula unit.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Volume × Molarity = 0.200 L × 0.5 mol/L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ = 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol\n\n### 3. Determine the Limiting Reactant for Neutralization\n\nThe neutralization reaction is:\nH⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\n\nWe compare the total moles of H⁺ ions (0.28 mol) with the total moles of OH⁻ ions (0.20 mol). Since there are fewer moles of OH⁻, it is the limiting reactant. This means that only 0.20 moles of OH⁻ will react, neutralizing 0.20 moles of H⁺ and forming 0.20 moles of water.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Neutralization\n\nThe standard enthalpy of neutralization for the reaction between a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -57.1 kJ per mole of water formed, or -13.7 kcal/mol. We are asked to calculate the total enthalpy of neutralization for this specific mixture.\n\n*   **Calculation in kJ:**\n    *   Enthalpy Change = Moles of H₂O formed × Standard Enthalpy of Neutralization\n    *   Enthalpy Change = 0.20 mol × (-57.1 kJ/mol) = -11.42 kJ\n\n*   **Convert to kcal:**\n    *   The conversion factor is 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ.\n    *   Enthalpy Change (kcal) = -11.42 kJ / 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ -2.729 kcal\n\nIt is important to note that a precipitation reaction also occurs:\nBa²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)\nThis reaction also releases heat (the enthalpy of precipitation). However, the question specifically asks for the \"enthalpy of neutralization\", which conventionally refers to the heat released from the H⁺ and OH⁻ reaction. Our calculated value for this specific process matches one of the options almost exactly.\n\nComparing our calculated value of -2.729 kcal to the given options:\nA) -16.0 kJ (= -3.82 kcal)\nB) -2.72 kcal\nC) -3.80 kcal\nD) -11.42 kcal\n\nThe calculated value of -2.729 kcal is a very close match to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
