    "Here is a breakdown of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition, a type of conjugate addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile.\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), C-2 and C-6.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has no protons to be removed.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 is tertiary and has one proton.\n    *   Therefore, the t-BuOK base can only remove the proton from C-6, forming the corresponding enolate.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate, with its nucleophilic carbon at C-6, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n4.  **Product Structure A**: The resulting product is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This specific IUPAC name arises from numbering the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain, where the point of attachment to the ring is C-1 of the substituent.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), creates a nucleophile from 1-nitropropane, which then adds to the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The nitro group (-NO2) is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the protons on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon) acidic. KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed.\n4.  **Product Structure B**: After protonation by water, the final product is formed. To name it, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile group. This results in a six-carbon chain (hexanenitrile).\n    *   The structure is: CH₃-CH₂(C6)-CH(NO₂)(C5)-CH(CH₃)(C4)-CH₂(C3)-CH₂(C2)-CN(C1)\n    *   Let's retrace the IUPAC numbering carefully based on the connectivity: `CN(C1)-CH2(C2)-CH(CH3)(C3)-CH(NO2)(C4)-CH2(C5)-CH3(C6)`.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name for this structure is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The product of reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nMatching these products with the given options leads to the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
