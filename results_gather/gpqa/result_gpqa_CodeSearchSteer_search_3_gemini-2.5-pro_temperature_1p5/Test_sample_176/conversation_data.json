    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. This relates luminosity to the star's radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    *   L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    *   Where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: To find the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars (L₁/L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n    *   L₁/L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    *   (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**: To find the temperature ratio, we use the information that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared brightest* are the same. This refers to the observed peak wavelength of their black body spectrum. This peak wavelength is related to the star's surface temperature by Wien's Displacement Law.\n    *   The information on radial velocities is crucial here. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,₁) is the same as its emitted peak wavelength (λ_emit,₁).\n    *   Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, meaning it is moving away from the observer. This causes its emitted light to be redshifted due to the Doppler effect. The observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength. For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 + v/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we can write: λ_emit,₁ = λ_emit,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Connecting Temperature and Wavelength**: Wien's Law states that the emitted peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature (λ_emit = b/T), where 'b' is Wien's constant. Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    *   T₁/T₂ = (b/λ_emit,₁) / (b/λ_emit,₂) = λ_emit,₂ / λ_emit,₁\n    *   Substituting the result from the Doppler shift: T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**: Now, we substitute all the values back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    *   L₁/L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    *   Given v₂ = 700 km/s = 7 x 10⁵ m/s and c (speed of light) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s.\n    *   v₂/c = (7 x 10⁵) / (3 x 10⁸) = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    *   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>"
