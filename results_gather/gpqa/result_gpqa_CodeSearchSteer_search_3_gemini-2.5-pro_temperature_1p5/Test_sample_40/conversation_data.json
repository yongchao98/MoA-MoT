    "This problem is a classic example of relativistic velocity addition, a concept explained by Einstein's theory of special relativity. It is similar to the famous Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in moving water.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Speed of light in the glass's rest frame:** In the reference frame of the glass itself, the speed of light is determined by the index of refraction, *n*. Since the speed of light in a vacuum, *c*, is given as 1, the speed of light within the glass (let's call it *u'*) is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n2.  **Velocity of the medium:** The glass is moving towards the observer with a velocity *v*.\n\n3.  **Relativistic velocity addition formula:** According to classical mechanics, one might simply add the velocities (`v + 1/n`). However, special relativity provides a different formula for adding velocities. If an object moves with velocity *u'* relative to a frame that is itself moving at velocity *v* relative to an observer, the object's velocity *u* in the observer's frame is given by:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Applying the formula:** We substitute the values from our problem into this equation, remembering that *c*=1:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c^2 = 1^2 = 1`\n\n    This gives:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v )`\n\n5.  **Simplifying the expression:** To simplify the fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by *n*:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( n*(1/n) + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*(v/n) )`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
