    "To determine the energy threshold for high-energy gamma-rays to have their lifetimes limited by pair production with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we must consider the kinematics of the reaction $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\n### 1. The Threshold Condition\n\nPair production can only occur if the total energy of the two interacting photons in their center-of-mass frame is at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair being created. At the minimum threshold, the electron and positron are created at rest in the center-of-mass frame.\n\nThe rest mass of an electron ($m_e$) is the same as that of a positron. The rest mass energy of an electron is $m_e c^2$, which is approximately 0.511 MeV. Therefore, the total rest mass energy of the pair is $2m_e c^2$.\n\n### 2. Relativistic Kinematics\n\nLet $E_\\gamma$ be the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray and $E_{CMB}$ be the energy of the photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background. The condition for the threshold energy can be derived using the invariance of the four-momentum squared. For a head-on collision, which provides the lowest possible threshold energy for the gamma-ray, the relationship is:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nThis formula gives the minimum energy the gamma-ray must have to create an electron-positron pair when colliding head-on with a CMB photon.\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   The average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nFirst, we need to ensure our units are consistent. Let's express everything in electron-volts (eV):\n*   $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV} = 5.11 \\times 10^5 \\text{ eV}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the threshold energy formula:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(5.11 \\times 10^5 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question provides the answers in giga-electron-volts (GeV). We need to convert our result to GeV:\n\n$1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated threshold energy for the gamma-ray is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nC) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nD) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\n\nOur calculated value matches option C. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies from about $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by pair production with CMB photons.\n\n<<<C>>>"
