    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**: This reaction protects the aldehyde functional group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT). The product, A, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane. This reaction is a standard procedure for protecting carbonyl groups.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton at the C2 position of the dithiane ring (the carbon bonded to the two sulfur atoms and the ethyl group) is acidic. The removal of this proton results in a lithiated dithiane anion, B, which is a potent nucleophile.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion B attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an SN2 reaction. This step attaches a second ethyl group to the C2 position of the dithiane ring, forming C, which is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: This step is the deprotection of the dithiane group to regenerate a carbonyl compound. The 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane is hydrolyzed back to a ketone. The product, D, is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O). This is a common method for dithiane deprotection.\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction, a method used to convert ketones or aldehydes into alkenes.\n    *   **Ylide Formation**: First, triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with the secondary alkyl halide, 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), to form a phosphonium salt. Subsequent treatment with the strong base BuLi deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus atom, forming a phosphorus ylide. While Wittig reactions with secondary halides can be inefficient, they are feasible. The ylide formed is Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n    *   **Wittig Reaction**: The ketone D (3-pentanone) reacts with the generated ylide. The carbonyl oxygen of 3-pentanone is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide.\n    *   **Product E**: The reaction between 3-pentanone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O, and the ylide, Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂, results in the formation of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂, and triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n\n### Determination of ¹³C-NMR Signals for Product E\n\nThe final product, E, is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. Its structure is:\n\n```\n      CH₂CH₃\n     /\nCH₃CH₂-C = C-CH₂CH₃\n         \\\n          CH₂CH₃\n```\n\nTo determine the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of unique carbon environments in the molecule. The molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. There is a C₂ axis of symmetry passing through the center of the C=C double bond, and a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the double bond.\n\nDue to this symmetry:\n1.  The two carbons of the central double bond (C=C) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one signal**.\n2.  All four methylene groups (-CH₂-) of the ethyl substituents are equivalent. This will produce a **second signal**.\n3.  All four terminal methyl groups (-CH₃) of the ethyl substituents are equivalent. This will produce a **third signal**.\n\nTherefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of the highly symmetrical 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene will show a total of 3 signals.\n\n<<<A>>>"
