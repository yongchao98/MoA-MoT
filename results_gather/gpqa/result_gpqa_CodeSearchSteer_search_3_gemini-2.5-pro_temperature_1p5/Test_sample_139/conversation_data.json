    "The provided information confirms the key points used in the logical deduction.\n\n*   **Substance B and Y:** The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (~3.82 °C), which is very close to the 277 K given in the prompt. This confirms the identity of B as D₂O. The violent reaction of X with a liquid to produce deuterated products (G and W) strongly implies the liquid Y is also D₂O.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The reaction of metal deuterides with D₂O produces D₂ gas. D₂ (deuterium gas) is a molecule where the number of protons (2) equals the number of neutrons (2), fitting the description of gas W.\n\n*   **Precipitate G:** The reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O would produce LiOD and Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate, which would make the deuterated version, Al(OD)₃, a precipitate as well. Heating a metal deuteroxide like Al(OD)₃ would release D₂O, which is substance B.\n\n*   **Substance X:** The logic pointed to Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). The search results confirm that its close analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a powerful and common reducing agent in organic chemistry. Crucially, LiAlH₄ is capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. Therefore, its reaction with an α-keto acid (R-CO-COOH), which contains a ketone and a carboxylic acid group, would reduce both to produce a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This resulting diol contains exactly two oxygen atoms, perfectly matching the final clue in the problem statement. The less potent reducing agent, NaBH₄, is generally not reactive enough to reduce carboxylic acids, making LiAlD₄ the correct choice for X.\n\nThe logical deduction that substance X is LiAlD₄ is well-supported.\n\nThe final step is the calculation:\n*   **Substance X:** Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as its heavier isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (by atomic number).\n*   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (by atomic number).\n*   **Instruction:** Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements. \"If multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... isotopes must be summed.\"\n*   **Mass of the lightest element's atoms (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of Deuterium (²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu. Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8 amu.\n*   **Mass of the heaviest element's atoms (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al). The mass is approximately 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative mass:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
