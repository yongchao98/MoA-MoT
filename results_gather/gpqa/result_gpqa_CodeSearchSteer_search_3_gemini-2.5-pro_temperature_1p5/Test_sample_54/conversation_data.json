    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the 1H NMR Data\n\nThe provided spectral data is:\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal corresponds to a single proton (1H) in the vinylic region (attached to a C=C double bond). It appears as a doublet (d), which means it is coupled to one adjacent proton. The crucial piece of information is the coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. For vinylic protons, a large coupling constant in the range of 11-18 Hz is characteristic of a *trans* stereochemistry. A *cis* configuration would show a smaller J value, typically between 6-15 Hz. This immediately suggests that the unknown compound is either Trans-propenyl acetate or Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal is also a single vinylic proton (1H). The splitting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   The **doublet (d)** portion arises from coupling to the other vinylic proton (the one at 7.0 ppm), and it would share the same J value of 16.0 Hz.\n    *   The **quartet (q)** portion indicates that this proton is also coupled to three equivalent neighboring protons, which is characteristic of an adjacent methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal represents three equivalent protons (3H) that are a singlet (s), meaning they have no adjacent protons to couple with. This chemical shift and multiplicity are highly characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (CH₃COO-). All four possible compounds contain this group.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal corresponds to three equivalent protons (3H), most likely a methyl group. The signal is a doublet (d), which means this methyl group is attached to a carbon that is bonded to a single proton. This is consistent with a CH₃-CH= fragment.\n\n### 2. Matching the Data to the Structures\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed structures based on the spectral analysis:\n\n*   **Cis-propenyl acetate and Cis-butenyl acetate:** The observed large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) rules out both *cis* isomers.\n\n*   **Trans-butenyl acetate (trans-1-butenyl acetate, CH₃CH₂CH=CHOAc):**\n    *   This structure has an ethyl group (CH₃CH₂-), not a methyl group, attached to the double bond.\n    *   The vinylic proton next to the ethyl group would be split into a doublet by the other vinylic proton and a triplet by the adjacent methylene (-CH₂-) group, resulting in a **doublet of triplets (dt)**, not the observed doublet of quartets (dq). This mismatch eliminates Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Trans-propenyl acetate (CH₃CH=CHOAc):**\n    *   **Acetate protons:** The CH₃COO- group accounts for the singlet at 2.1 ppm (3H, s).\n    *   **Vinylic protons:** There are two protons on the double bond in a *trans* arrangement.\n        *   The proton attached to the carbon with the oxygen (CHOAc) is highly deshielded and appears furthest downfield. It is split into a doublet by its vinylic neighbor. This matches the **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)** signal.\n        *   The other vinylic proton (-CH=) is coupled to the first vinylic proton (creating a doublet) and to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet). This perfectly matches the **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)** signal.\n    *   **Allylic protons:** The methyl group protons (-CH₃) are adjacent to a single vinylic proton, which splits their signal into a doublet. This matches the **1.6 ppm (3H, d)** signal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe observed 1H NMR data, particularly the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) indicating a *trans* geometry and the doublet of quartets (dq) splitting pattern indicating a methyl group on the double bond, is fully consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
