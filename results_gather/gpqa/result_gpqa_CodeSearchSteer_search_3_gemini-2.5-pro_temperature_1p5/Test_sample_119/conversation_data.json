    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we can make a few key assumptions based on the problem statement. The primary assumption is that stars are distributed uniformly throughout space.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Density**: We assume the number of stars per unit volume, known as the number density (ρ), is constant everywhere.\n\n2.  **Volume of Space**: Consider a thin spherical shell of space with radius *d* and thickness *dd*. The volume of this shell (*dV*) is its surface area (4π*d*²) multiplied by its thickness (*dd*).\n    *   dV = 4π*d*² *dd*\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in the Shell**: The number of stars (*dN*) in this thin shell is the product of the number density (ρ) and the volume of the shell (*dV*).\n    *   *dN* = ρ * *dV* = 4πρ*d*² *dd*\n\n4.  **Relating Distance to Parallax**: The parallax (plx or *p*) is inversely proportional to the distance (*d*). The relationship is given by *d* = 1/*p*.\n\n5.  **Converting the Differential**: We need to express *dN* in terms of parallax (*p*) instead of distance (*d*). To do this, we differentiate the distance-parallax relation:\n    *   *d* = 1/*p*\n    *   *dd*/*dp* = -1/*p*²\n    *   Therefore, *dd* = -(1/*p*²) *dp*\n\n    When considering a small interval, we are interested in its magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign, which merely indicates that distance and parallax are inversely related.\n    *   *dd* = (1/*p*²) *dp*\n\n6.  **Substituting into the Star Count Equation**: Now, we substitute the expressions for *d* and *dd* back into the equation for *dN*:\n    *   *dN* = 4πρ * (1/*p*)² * (1/*p*²) *dp*\n\n7.  **Simplifying the Expression**: Combining the terms gives us the number of stars within a parallax interval *dp*.\n    *   *dN* = 4πρ * (1/*p*⁴) *dp*\n\n8.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax**: The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is *dN*/*dp*.\n    *   *dN*/*dp* = 4πρ / *p*⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, we can see the final proportionality:\n*dN*/*dp* ∝ 1/*p*⁴\n\nThis result is a foundational concept in statistical astronomy and is related to the Lutz-Kelker bias, where this distribution is a key factor. Assuming a uniform spatial distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<C>>>"
