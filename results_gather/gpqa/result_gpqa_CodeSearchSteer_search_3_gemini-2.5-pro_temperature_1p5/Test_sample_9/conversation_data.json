    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. This serves as our baseline.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** For planets with the same composition, density is influenced by the planet's mass due to gravitational compression. A less massive planet will have weaker gravity, resulting in less compression of its materials. Therefore, a planet with half the mass of Earth but the same composition would be less dense than Earth.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** Conversely, a more massive planet has stronger gravity, which compresses its material more significantly. This effect increases the planet's overall density. Theoretical models show that for planets with an Earth-like composition, density increases with mass. A rocky planet with 5 times the mass of Earth would be compressed to a much higher density than 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy comparing the options:\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (d) would have a density lower than 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) would have a density significantly higher than 5.5 g/cm³ due to greater gravitational compression.\n\nTherefore, the planet with five times the mass of Earth and the same composition will have the highest density.\n\n<<<B>>>"
