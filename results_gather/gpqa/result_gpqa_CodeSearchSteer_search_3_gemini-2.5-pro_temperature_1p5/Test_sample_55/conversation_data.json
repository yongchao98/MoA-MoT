    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions follows specific quantum mechanical selection rules. A direct transition is forbidden because the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, ∆l, would be zero, which violates the rule that ∆l must be ±1 for a dipole transition. Therefore, the decay must occur through an intermediate state in a two-step process, often called a cascade.\n\n1.  **First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → Intermediate State**\n    *   The initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩ (a 3s orbital).\n    *   According to the selection rule ∆l = ±1, the orbital quantum number *l* must change from 0 to 1. This means the intermediate state must be a *p* orbital (l=1).\n    *   The selection rule for the magnetic quantum number *m* is ∆m = 0, ±1. Since the initial state has m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = -1, 0, or +1.\n    *   The options provided specify the intermediate state has a principal quantum number n=2. Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n2.  **Second Transition: Intermediate State → |1,0,0⟩**\n    *   The intermediate state has l=1. The final state |1,0,0⟩ has l=0. The change, ∆l = 0 - 1 = -1, is allowed by the selection rules.\n    *   For the magnetic quantum number, the final state has m=0. The transition from the intermediate m' to the final m=0 must satisfy ∆m = 0 - m' = 0, ±1. This condition is met for all possible intermediate states (m' = -1, 0, 1).\n\n**Transition Pathway and Probability**\n\nThe overall process is a cascade from the 3s state to the 1s state through one of the 2p states: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This corresponds to the branching ratio for the first step of the decay.\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of a photon. Consequently, the transitions to the three possible intermediate sublevels (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩) are equally likely. The total probability of transitioning from the |3,0,0⟩ state to any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states is the sum of the probabilities for each path. Since the three paths are equally probable, each must have a probability of 1/3 of the total 3s → 2p transition probability.\n\nSince the only allowed downward decay from the 3s state is to a 2p state, this branching ratio of 1/3 represents the probability of the entire cascade following that specific intermediate channel.\n\nTherefore, the probability for the transition route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1/3. The same probability of 1/3 applies to the routes via |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\nBased on the provided options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect probability.\n*   B) Incorrect probability and incomplete initial state notation.\n*   C) Incorrect probability.\n*   D) Correctly identifies a valid route and the corresponding probability.\n\nThe correct route and probability are:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n<<<D>>>"
