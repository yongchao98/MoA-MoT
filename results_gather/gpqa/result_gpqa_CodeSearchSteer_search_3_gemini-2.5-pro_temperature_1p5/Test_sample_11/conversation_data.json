    "My initial derivation and calculations are confirmed by the search results.\n\nSpecifically, the decay of a stationary pion into a muon and a neutrino is a classic two-body decay problem solvable with conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe steps are:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The rest energy of the stationary pion equals the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino. The total energy released, also known as the Q-value, is the difference between the pion's rest mass and the muon's rest mass (since the neutrino is considered massless).\n    *   Q = (m_pi - m_mu) * c^2 = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. This energy is distributed as kinetic energy between the two product particles.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the pion is at rest (initial momentum is zero), the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let's call the magnitude of this momentum 'p'.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Kinematics**: Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation (E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2), we can solve for the individual energies and momenta.\n    *   For the massless neutrino, its energy (E_nu) is equal to its momentum times c (E_nu = pc). Therefore, its kinetic energy is also equal to pc.\n    *   For the muon, E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu * c^2.\n\nSolving these equations, as done in my scratchpad, gives the momentum of each particle and subsequently their kinetic energies. A detailed calculation gives the muon kinetic energy as approximately 4.12 MeV and the neutrino's energy as approximately 29.8 MeV. These values match one of the multiple-choice options. HyperPhysics also cites the muon's kinetic energy in this decay as 4.13 MeV. An academic paper from 1994 measured the momentum of the muon from pion decay at rest to be 29.79207 MeV/c, which corresponds to a neutrino energy of about 29.8 MeV and a muon kinetic energy of about 4.1 MeV, further confirming the result.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are:\n*   Muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\n*   Neutrino (nu): 29.8 MeV\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
