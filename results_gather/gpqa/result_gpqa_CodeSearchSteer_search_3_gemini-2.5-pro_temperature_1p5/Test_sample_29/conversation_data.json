    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound.\n\n### 1. Determine the Wavelength of Emitted Light\nFirst, we need to convert the energy of the emitted light from electron volts (eV) to a wavelength in nanometers (nm). The relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is given by the formula:\n\nλ = hc / E\n\nWhere:\n*   h = Planck's constant\n*   c = the speed of light\n*   E = energy\n\nA simplified and useful formula for this conversion is:\nλ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\nGiven the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV:\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393\nλ ≈ 530 nm\n\n### 2. Identify the Color of Emitted Light\nA wavelength of 530 nm corresponds to the green region of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\n### 3. Relate Emitted Light to Absorbed Light\nWhen a molecule absorbs light, an electron is promoted to a higher energy level. When it returns to its ground state, it can emit light (a process called fluorescence). Due to energy loss through molecular vibrations (a phenomenon known as the Stokes shift), the emitted light always has lower energy and a longer wavelength than the absorbed light.\n\nThis means the organic compound must absorb light with a higher energy and a shorter wavelength than the green light (530 nm) it emits.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Options Based on Wavelength\nLet's examine the colors provided in the options and their corresponding approximate wavelengths:\n*   **A) Yellow:** ~570–590 nm (Longer wavelength, lower energy than green)\n*   **B) Red:** ~630–780 nm (Longer wavelength, lower energy than green)\n*   **C) Violet:** ~380–440 nm (Shorter wavelength, higher energy than green)\n*   **D) Blue:** ~440–495 nm (Shorter wavelength, higher energy than green)\n\nBased on the principle that absorbed light must have a shorter wavelength than the emitted light, we can eliminate Red and Yellow.\n\n### 5. Determine the Most Likely Absorbed Color\nBoth Violet and Blue have shorter wavelengths and higher energies than the emitted green light and are therefore possible candidates. However, for most fluorescent dyes, the absorption and emission spectra are relatively close. The absorbed color is typically in the adjacent higher-energy region of the spectrum. Since the dye emits green light (495–566 nm), it most strongly absorbs light in the next shortest wavelength region, which is blue (436-495 nm). This absorption of blue light leads to the emission of the lower-energy green light.\n\n<<<D>>>"
