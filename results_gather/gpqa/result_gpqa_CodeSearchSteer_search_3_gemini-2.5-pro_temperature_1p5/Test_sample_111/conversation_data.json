    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalize the state `|alpha>`\n\nThe given state is `|alpha> ∝ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nLet the normalized state be `|alpha> = C * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`.\n\nThe normalization condition is `<alpha|alpha> = 1`.\nThe corresponding bra vector is `<alpha| = C* * [(1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down|]`.\n\nThe inner product is:\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1² - i²) + (2² - i²)]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1 + 1) + (4 + 1)]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * (2 + 5) = 7|C|²`\n\nSince `<alpha|alpha> = 1`, we have `7|C|² = 1`, which gives `|C|² = 1/7`. We can choose the real and positive value for `C`, so `C = 1/√7`.\n\nThe normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/√7) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\n\nIn matrix notation, in the basis `{|up>, |down>}` (where `|up> = [1, 0]ᵀ` and `|down> = [0, 1]ᵀ`), the state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ`\n\n### 2. Find the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of the Operator A\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` for `i ≠ j` and `Aij = 0` for `i = j`. This gives the matrix:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues: `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding eigenvectors (eigenstates):\n*   For `λ₁ = +hbar/2`:\n    `(A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0`\n    `[[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] * [a, b]ᵀ = [0, 0]ᵀ`\n    This leads to the equation `-a + b = 0`, or `a = b`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]ᵀ`. Normalizing it gives `|v₁> = (1/√2) * [1, 1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   For `λ₂ = -hbar/2`:\n    `(A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0`\n    `[[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]] * [c, d]ᵀ = [0, 0]ᵀ`\n    This leads to the equation `c + d = 0`, or `c = -d`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]ᵀ`. Normalizing it gives `|v₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|vᵢ>` is given by `P(λᵢ) = |<vᵢ|alpha>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability for λ₁ = +hbar/2 (eigenstate |v₁>):**\n    `<v₁|alpha> = [(1/√2) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/√14) * [(1+i)<up|up> + (2-i)<up|down> + (1+i)<down|up> + (2-i)<down|down>]`\n    Using the orthonormality of `|up>` and `|down>`, we get:\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/√14) * (1+i + 2-i) = 3/√14`\n    The probability is `P(λ₁) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`.\n\n*   **Probability for λ₂ = -hbar/2 (eigenstate |v₂>):**\n    `<v₂|alpha> = [(1/√2) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/√14) * (1+i - (2-i)) = (1/√14) * (-1 + 2i)`\n    The probability is `P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`.\n\nThe probabilities are approximately `0.64` and `0.36`.\n\n### 4. Find the Average Value of the Operator\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A is given by `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`.\nAlternatively, it can be calculated using the eigenvalues and their probabilities: `<A> = Σᵢ P(λᵢ)λᵢ`.\n\nUsing the second method:\n`<A> = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (4/14) = (hbar/2) * (2/7)`\n`<A> = hbar/7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are `0.64` and `0.36`, and the average value is `hbar/7`. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
