    "The initial analysis was correct. I will formalize the steps and present the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The given potential is a function of polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    To simplify the potential, we convert it to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the standard transformations:\n    *   r² = x² + y²\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n\n    Substituting these into the potential expression:\n    *   The first term is 1/2 kr² = 1/2 k(x² + y²).\n    *   The second term is 3/2 k(r cos(θ))² = 3/2 kx².\n\n    Now, combine the terms to get V(x, y):\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 kx²\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx² + 1/2 ky²\n    V(x, y) = (4/2)kx² + 1/2 ky²\n    V(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n3.  **Identify the System:**\n    The potential in Cartesian coordinates, V(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky², is separable into two independent one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator potentials:\n    *   V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    *   V_x(x) = 2kx²\n    *   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\n4.  **Recall the 1D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (QHO) Energy Spectrum:**\n    The potential for a general 1D QHO is V(z) = 1/2 mω²z², where ω is the angular frequency. The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by:\n    E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.\n\n    We can also express the potential in terms of an effective spring constant, K, as V(z) = 1/2 Kz². In this form, the angular frequency is ω = sqrt(K/m).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy for Each Independent Oscillator:**\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        *   V_x(x) = 2kx² = 1/2 (4k)x².\n        *   The effective spring constant is K_x = 4k.\n        *   The angular frequency is ω_x = sqrt(K_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m).\n        *   The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are E_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m).\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        *   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky².\n        *   The effective spring constant is K_y = k.\n        *   The angular frequency is ω_y = sqrt(K_y / m) = sqrt(k/m).\n        *   The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are E_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m).\n\n6.  **Determine the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    Since the Hamiltonian is separable (H = H_x + H_y), the total energy E is the sum of the individual energies E_nx and E_ny.\n    E = E_nx + E_ny\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    We can factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m). This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
