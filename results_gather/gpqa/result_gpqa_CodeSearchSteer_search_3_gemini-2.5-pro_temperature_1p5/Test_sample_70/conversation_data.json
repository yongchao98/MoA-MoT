    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its distance (semi-major axis, 'a') from its star, assuming the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo. This can be expressed as:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\nWhere a₂ and a₄ are the semi-major axes of Planet_2 and Planet_4, respectively.\n\n### 2. Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). This relationship is described as:\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nFrom this, we can establish a relationship for the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nThis allows us to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of two planets based on their orbital periods:\n\na₂ / a₄ = (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)\n\n### 3. Combining the Equations\n\nBy substituting the expression for the ratio of the semi-major axes (from Kepler's Third Law) into the temperature ratio equation, we get:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = [ (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods (P) for the five planets as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We can assign these values as the relative periods:\n*   Period of Planet_2 (P₂) = 2\n*   Period of Planet_4 (P₄) = 3.5\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio of these periods:\n\nP₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5 = 4 / 7\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>"
