    "To determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, each molecule must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from a chiral center or axial chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls that have bulky groups in the ortho-positions (the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions) experience hindered rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. If the substitution pattern also removes planes of symmetry, the molecule can exist as non-superimposable mirror images known as atropisomers. In this molecule, the nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and the dimethyl dicarboxylate groups at the 2 and 2' positions are large enough to prevent free rotation. This restricted rotation, combined with the substitution pattern, results in axial chirality, making the molecule optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule's central carbon atom (at the 2-position) is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center (or stereocenter). Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and thus optically active. Methyl lactate exists as two enantiomers, (R)-methyl lactate and (S)-methyl lactate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone features a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings. The carbon atom of the carbonyl group is spÂ² hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (two carbon atoms of the phenyl rings and one oxygen atom). It lacks a chiral center. While individual benzophenone molecules are achiral, they can crystallize in a chiral arrangement, but as an individual molecule, it is not optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral and, therefore, not optically active. While it can react to form chiral products, the molecule itself is non-chiral.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>"
