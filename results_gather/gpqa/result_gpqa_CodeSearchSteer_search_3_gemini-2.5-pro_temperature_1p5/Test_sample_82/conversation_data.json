    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 moles\n*   **Total volume after dilution:**\n    Volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   **Concentration of diluted acetic acid (Ca):**\n    Concentration = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), while 75% of the acetic acid remains. This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH of a buffer:\n    pH = pKa + log (\\[Conjugate Base] / \\[Weak Acid])\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Determine the ratio of conjugate base to weak acid:**\n    At 25% titration, the ratio of \\[CH₃COO⁻] to \\[CH₃COOH] is 25 / 75 = 1/3.\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.26\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by NaOH, and the solution contains only its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The acetate ion will then react with water (hydrolysis), producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Determine the volume of NaOH added:**\n    At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 moles.\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (\\[A⁻]):**\n    \\[A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Calculate Kb for the acetate ion:**\n    The acetate ion hydrolyzes as: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration (\\[OH⁻]):**\n    Kb = \\[CH₃COOH]\\[OH⁻] / \\[CH₃COO⁻] ≈ \\[OH⁻]² / \\[A⁻]\n    \\[OH⁻] = √(Kb × \\[A⁻]) = √(5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    pOH = -log(\\[OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\nBased on the calculations, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<B>>>"
