    "The experiment described involves tracking an antigen (rotavirus capsid protein) to the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the intestine. In these sites, an immune response is initiated, characterized by a \"proliferating cell population,\" which are activated B cells located in structures called germinal centers. The crucial finding is \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene of these B cells. This points to a specific process of antibody gene diversification.\n\nHere is an analysis of the options:\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system involving a cascade of serum proteins. It does not involve genetic alterations in B cells and is therefore incorrect.\n*   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs specifically in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches following antigen stimulation. SHM introduces point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes. This generates high variability and is the mechanism for producing antibodies with progressively higher affinity for the antigen. This perfectly matches the experimental observations. Peyer's patches are known to have a very high frequency of somatic mutations in the immunoglobulin variable genes.\n*   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers, often concurrently with SHM. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, which alters the antibody's effector function (e.g., switching from IgM to IgA), not its antigen-binding specificity. The observation of high variability in the *variable* region is the direct result of SHM, not CSR.\n*   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the genetic recombination process that initially creates the diverse repertoire of antibodies in developing B cells. It occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) *before* the B cells encounter an antigen. The scenario described is a response to an antigen in a secondary lymphoid organ, involving further diversification of an already-activated B cell population, which is characteristic of SHM.\n\nThe process taking place is the one responsible for introducing numerous point mutations into the variable region of antibodies in activated, proliferating B cells within a germinal center. This process is somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
