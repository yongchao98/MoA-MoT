    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3400–2500 cm-1 (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is typical for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, and its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1:** These peaks are indicative of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\nBased on the IR data, compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this downfield region (typically 10-13 ppm) is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons *ortho* to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Region Signals:**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 hydrogens indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3 hydrogens indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2 hydrogens is likely a methylene group (-CH₂) coupled to multiple, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1 hydrogen is a methine group (-CH). Its downfield shift suggests it is benzylic (attached directly to the benzene ring).\n\n    Assembling these pieces, the signals correspond to a **sec-butyl** group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃]. The methine proton (2.9 ppm) is attached to the ring, a methyl group (1.4 ppm), and a methylene group (1.7 ppm). The methylene group is in turn attached to the terminal methyl group (0.9 ppm).\n\n**3. Identification of Compound X**\n\nCombining the spectroscopic evidence, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This structure matches all the provided IR and NMR data. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n**4. The Reaction and Final Product**\n\nThe reaction of Compound X with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a powerful reduction reaction. This reagent combination is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring remains unchanged under these conditions.\n\n*   **Starting Material (Compound X):** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene (also known as 4-sec-butyltoluene).\n\nThis final product matches the description for **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
