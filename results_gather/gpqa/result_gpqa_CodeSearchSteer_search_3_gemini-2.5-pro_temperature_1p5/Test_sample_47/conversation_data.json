    "The multi-step synthesis described involves the following transformations:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂):** This is the α-bromination of a ketone, which produces 2-bromocyclohexanone as Product 1.\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH):** When an α-halo ketone like 2-bromocyclohexanone is treated with a strong base, it can undergo a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves a ring contraction. In this case, 2-bromocyclohexanone rearranges to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, which is Product 2.\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine:** Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides. Pyridine is typically used as a base to neutralize the HCl produced during the reaction. Therefore, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is converted to cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3).\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃):** This reagent is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used for the selective reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol. Thus, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced to cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, which is the final product, Product 4.\n\nThe final step is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. The structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n*   The carbon atom of the ring that is attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is a stereocenter, as it is bonded to four different groups: the aldehyde group, a hydrogen atom, and two different paths around the ring. This makes the molecule chiral.\n*   In a chiral molecule, protons that cannot be interchanged by a rotational axis or a rapid conformational process are chemically distinct.\n*   The cyclopentane ring is not planar and undergoes rapid pseudorotation at room temperature. This rapid conformational change averages the environments of certain protons, creating an effective plane of symmetry on the NMR timescale.\n*   This time-averaged plane of symmetry passes through the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon, and the H attached to C1, bisecting the C3-C4 bond.\n\nBased on this effective symmetry, we can identify the sets of chemically distinct protons:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 signal)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This methine proton is also unique. (1 signal)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C5. However, because C2 is adjacent to the C1 stereocenter, the two geminal protons on C2 are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct from each other. The same applies to C5. Therefore, these four protons give rise to two distinct signals. (2 signals)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry renders the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C4. The two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. The same holds for C4. These four protons also give rise to two distinct signals. (2 signals)\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>"
