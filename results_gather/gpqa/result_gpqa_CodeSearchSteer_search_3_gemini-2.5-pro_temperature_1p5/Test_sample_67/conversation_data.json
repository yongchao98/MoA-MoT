    "This physical phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle has a spin of 1/2 and its magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the initial state of the particle's spin, at time t=0, is the \"spin up\" state along the z-axis.\n\n2.  **New Magnetic Field:** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude, B. The Hamiltonian, which describes the energy of the system, is now determined by the interaction of the magnetic moment (μ) with this new magnetic field. The Hamiltonian H is given by H = -**μ** · **B** = - (γ**S**) · (B**ĵ**) = -γB*S<sub>y</sub>, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and S<sub>y</sub> is the y-component of the spin operator.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** According to quantum mechanics, the expectation value (or average) of the z-component of the spin, <S<sub>z</sub>>, evolves in time. Its rate of change is governed by the Heisenberg equation of motion, which leads to a set of coupled differential equations for the expectation values of the spin components:\n    *   d<S<sub>z</sub>>/dt = γB <S<sub>x</sub>>\n    *   d<S<sub>x</sub>>/dt = -γB <S<sub>z</sub>>\n\n4.  **Solving for the Frequency:** By differentiating the first equation with respect to time and substituting the second equation into it, we arrive at a second-order differential equation for <S<sub>z</sub>>:\n    *   d²<S<sub>z</sub>>/dt² = - (γB)² <S<sub>z</sub>>\n\n5.  **Oscillation Frequency:** This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x, where ω is the angular frequency of oscillation. By comparing the two equations, we can identify the oscillation frequency ω as:\n    *   ω = γB\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment, <μ<sub>z</sub>> = γ<S<sub>z</sub>>, will therefore oscillate with an angular frequency of γB. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\n<<<C>>>"
