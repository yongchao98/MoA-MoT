    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n    The problem states that compound A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) in A2 is given as 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ωF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    Using the atomic mass of Fluorine (F) as ~19 g/mol:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19) / (M(Y) + n * 19)\n\n    Solving for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19n - 6.0724n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n\n    We can test integer values for n:\n    *   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium)\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine or Selenium)\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n\n    Let's verify this by calculating the precise mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃:\n    M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol; M(F) = 18.998 g/mol\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol\n    ωF(SbF₃) = (3 * 18.998) / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with the minor difference likely due to rounding in the problem data. Thus, we can confidently identify:\n    *   **Y = Antimony (Sb)**\n    *   **A2 = Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃)**\n\n2.  **Identify Compound A3**\n    *   A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Antimony).\n    *   A3 can interact with xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a well-known strong Lewis acid that reacts with xenon fluorides (e.g., XeF₄) to form salts like [XeF₃]⁺[SbF₆]⁻. It can also be prepared by the direct reaction of antimony with fluorine.\n    *   Therefore, **A3 = Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound A4**\n    *   A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\".\n    *   Elemental antimony (Y) is added to A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce A5. This suggests a comproportionation reaction, where Sb(0) reacts with an antimony compound of a higher oxidation state (present in A4) to form a compound of an intermediate state (A5). A4 must therefore contain antimony in the +5 oxidation state.\n    *   A simple solution of SbF₅ could be considered, but a more prominent chemical entity that fits the description of a \"colorless concentrated solution\" containing Sb(V) is **fluoroantimonic acid (HSbF₆)**.\n    *   Fluoroantimonic acid is a superacid, typically a mixture of hydrogen fluoride (HF) and antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). The 1:1 mixture forms H[SbF₆] and is a colorless liquid. This is the most logical candidate for A4.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**\n    Assuming A4 is fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆, we can calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(H) = 1.008 g/mol\n    M(Sb) = 121.760 g/mol\n    M(F) = 18.998 g/mol\n    M(HSbF₆) = 1.008 + 121.760 + 6 * 18.998 = 236.756 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 236.76 g/mol falls within the range of **220-240**.\n\nAlthough there are some inconsistencies in the description of compound A1 (SbF₅ is colorless, not bright-red, and is stable at 293K), the identification of Y as Sb, A2 as SbF₃, and A4 as HSbF₆ is based on strong, consistent chemical evidence. The molecular weight of HSbF₆ definitively fits into one of the provided ranges.\n\n<<<A>>>"
