    "To determine the energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus accelerated to 0.96c, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus**: The nucleus X is Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Since Lithium's atomic number is 3 (meaning it has 3 protons), the total mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons, which is 3 + 3 = 6. Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rest Energy ($E_0$)**: The energy of a particle at rest is given by Einstein's equation, $E_0 = m_0 c^2$. For a nucleus, a common and effective approximation, often used in such physics problems, is to calculate the rest mass by multiplying its mass number (A) by the mass of a single nucleon. Using the neutron mass gives a particularly accurate result for this problem.\n    *   The mass number (A) of $^{6}$Li is 6.\n    *   The rest energy of a neutron is approximately 939.566 MeV/cÂ².\n    *   Rest energy of the nucleus $E_0 \\approx 6 \\times 939.566 \\, \\text{MeV} = 5637.396 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The Lorentz factor is a function of the object's speed and is required for relativistic calculations.\n    *   The speed is given as v = 0.96c.\n    *   The Lorentz factor formula is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   Substituting the speed: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.28}$.\n    *   $\\gamma \\approx 3.5714$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**: The total energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by $E = \\gamma E_0$.\n    *   $E \\approx 3.5714 \\times 5637.396 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   $E \\approx 20133.56 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n5.  **Convert the Energy to Giga-electron Volts (GeV)**: Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, we convert the result.\n    *   $E \\approx \\frac{20133.56 \\, \\text{MeV}}{1000} \\approx 20.134 \\, \\text{GeV}$.\n\nThis calculated value of 20.134 GeV is extremely close to the value given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
