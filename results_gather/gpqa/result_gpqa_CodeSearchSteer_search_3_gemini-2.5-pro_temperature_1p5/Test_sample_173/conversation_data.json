    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Initial mass = M\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy = M*c² = 300 GeV\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   Fragment 1 is the more massive one: m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe can express the rest-mass energies of the fragments (m₁c² and m₂c²) in terms of the initial rest-mass energy (Mc²).\n\n*   From the given relations:\n    *   m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n    *   Since m₁ = 2 * m₂, it follows that m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²).\n\n*   Now, substitute the second equation into the first:\n    *   2*(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV\n    *   3*(m₂c²) = 297 GeV\n    *   m₂c² = 99 GeV\n\n*   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is:\n    *   m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²) = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (T₁ + T₂) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy. This is known as the Q-value of the reaction.\n\n*   Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Mc²) - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by T = p²/2m. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be 'p'.\n\n*   T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)\n*   T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)\n\nNow we can find the ratio of their kinetic energies:\n*   T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂/m₁ = m₂/(2m₂) = 1/2.\n*   This means T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy calculated in step 3:\n*   T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\n*   T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n*   3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n*   **T₁_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁\n\nFor the relativistic calculation, we must use the principles of conservation of four-momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved. The initial total energy is E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV. The final total energy is E_final = E₁ + E₂, where E₁ = T₁ + m₁c² and E₂ = T₂ + m₂c² are the total relativistic energies of the fragments.\n    *   E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The magnitude of the momentum of the two fragments is equal, p₁ = p₂ = p. The relativistic relationship between total energy, momentum, and rest-mass energy is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   This gives (pc)² = E² - (mc²)².\n    *   Since the momenta are equal: E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²\n    *   E₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²\n    *   (E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²\n    *   (E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = (198 - 99)(198 + 99) GeV²\n    *   (E₁ - E₂)(300) = (99)(297)\n    *   E₁ - E₂ = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV\n\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for E₁ and E₂:\n    1.  E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV\n    2.  E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV\n\n*   Adding the two equations gives:\n    *   2E₁ = 398.01 GeV\n    *   E₁ = 199.005 GeV\n\n*   The kinetic energy T₁ is the total energy E₁ minus the rest-mass energy m₁c²:\n    *   T₁ = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T₁ and the classically calculated T₁.\n\n*   Difference = T₁ - T₁_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
