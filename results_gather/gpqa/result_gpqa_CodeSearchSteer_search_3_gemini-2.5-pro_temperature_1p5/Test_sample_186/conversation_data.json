    "### Summary of Information\n\nTo determine which of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, a few key pieces of information are required: the star's apparent visual magnitude (V), its declination to assess visibility from the Paranal Observatory, and ESPRESSO's performance characteristics.\n\nA star is deemed \"detectable\" if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel can be achieved in a one-hour (3600-second) exposure.\n\n#### Star & Observatory Data\n\n1.  **Paranal Observatory Location**: The observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. This means stars with a declination roughly south of +65 degrees are observable.\n2.  **Canopus (a)**:\n    *   Apparent V magnitude: -0.74.\n    *   Declination: -52° 41′. It is clearly visible from Paranal.\n3.  **Polaris (b)**:\n    *   Apparent V magnitude: ~2.0.\n    *   Declination: ~+89° 15′. As the North Star, it is not visible from the Southern Hemisphere's Paranal Observatory.\n4.  **Hypothetical Stars (c, d, e, f)**:\n    *   These stars are all located at a declination of 0 degrees, which is on the celestial equator and is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n    *   Their apparent magnitudes (m) must be calculated from their absolute magnitude (M=15) and distance (d) using the formula: m = M - 5 + 5*log₁₀(d).\n        *   **Star (c)**: d = 10 pc -> m = 15 - 5 + 5*log₁₀(10) = **15 mag**.\n        *   **Star (d)**: d = 200 pc -> m = 15 - 5 + 5*log₁₀(200) ≈ 10 + 5*(2.301) ≈ **21.5 mag**.\n        *   **Star (e)**: d = 5 pc -> m = 15 - 5 + 5*log₁₀(5) ≈ 10 + 5*(0.699) ≈ **13.5 mag**.\n        *   **Star (f)**: d = 50 pc -> m = 15 - 5 + 5*log₁₀(50) ≈ 10 + 5*(1.699) ≈ **18.5 mag**.\n\n#### ESPRESSO Spectrograph Performance\n\nThe ESPRESSO User Manual provides signal-to-noise ratio estimates. For a 3600-second (1-hour) exposure in `singleHR` mode, the graph shows the expected S/N versus stellar magnitude.\n*   A star with V = 15 gives an S/N ratio of approximately 30-40.\n*   A star with V = 17 gives an S/N ratio of about 10.\n*   The limiting magnitude to achieve an S/N of 10 in one hour appears to be around V=17.\nESPRESSO can operate using one 8.2m VLT Unit Telescope (1-UT mode) or all four combined (4-UT mode). The question specifies coupling with \"one of the 8m VLT telescopes\", implying 1-UT mode.\n\n### Analysis of Each Star's Detectability\n\n*   **a) Canopus**: With an apparent magnitude of -0.74, Canopus is exceptionally bright. It is also visible from Paranal with a declination of -52°. It will far exceed the required S/N of 10 in a 1-hour exposure. **Therefore, Canopus is detectable.**\n*   **b) Polaris**: With a declination of nearly +90°, Polaris is not visible from Paranal Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere. **Therefore, Polaris is not detectable.**\n*   **c) Star with m=15**: This star has an apparent magnitude of 15 and a declination of 0°, making it observable. Based on the ESPRESSO performance data, a V=15 star achieves an S/N well above 10 in a 1-hour exposure. **Therefore, this star is detectable.**\n*   **d) Star with m=21.5**: At magnitude 21.5, this star is far too faint to achieve an S/N of 10 in one hour with a single VLT unit. **Therefore, this star is not detectable.**\n*   **e) Star with m=13.5**: This star has an apparent magnitude of 13.5 and is observable. Since it is significantly brighter than V=15, it will easily achieve an S/N greater than 10. **Therefore, this star is detectable.**\n*   **f) Star with m=18.5**: At magnitude 18.5, this star is fainter than the V=17 limiting magnitude for an S/N of 10 in a one-hour exposure in single-telescope mode. **Therefore, this star is not detectable.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe stars that meet the detectability criteria are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star with apparent magnitude 15\n3.  Star with apparent magnitude 13.5\n\nIn total, 3 of the listed stars would be detectable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
