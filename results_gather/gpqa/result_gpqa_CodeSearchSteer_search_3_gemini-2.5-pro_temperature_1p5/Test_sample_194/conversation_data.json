    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Setup:** We have two planets orbiting the same star in the same orbital plane. This means they share the same orbital inclination (`i`) relative to our line of sight. Both planets are in circular orbits.\n\n2.  **Define the Impact Parameter:** The transit impact parameter (`b`) is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at mid-transit, measured in units of the star's radius. The formula is:\n    `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_star`\n    where `a` is the semi-major axis (the orbit's radius for a circular orbit), `i` is the orbital inclination, and `R_star` is the star's radius.\n\n3.  **Use Information from Planet 1:** We are given that Planet 1 has an orbital period (P1) of 3 days and an impact parameter (b1) of 0.2.\n    `b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_star = 0.2`\n\n4.  **Determine the Condition for Planet 2 to Transit:** For a second planet to transit, its center must pass across the star's disk. The limiting case for this is when the planet's center grazes the edge of the star. This corresponds to a maximum impact parameter (`b2_max`) of 1. Therefore, for Planet 2 to transit, its impact parameter `b2` must be less than or equal to 1.\n    `b2 = (a2 * cos(i)) / R_star ≤ 1`\n    The additional information about the radii of the planets and the star is not needed if we assume the standard definition of a transit where the center of the planet must pass in front of the star (`b ≤ 1`).\n\n5.  **Relate the Two Planets:** Since both planets are in the same plane and orbit the same star, the term `cos(i) / R_star` is a constant for the system. From Planet 1's data, we can find this constant in terms of its semi-major axis, `a1`:\n    `cos(i) / R_star = 0.2 / a1`\n\n6.  **Find the Maximum Semi-Major Axis for Planet 2:** Now, substitute this expression into the condition for Planet 2's transit:\n    `a2 * (0.2 / a1) ≤ 1`\n    To find the maximum possible semi-major axis for Planet 2 (`a2_max`), we solve for the equality:\n    `a2 / a1 = 1 / 0.2`\n    `a2 / a1 = 5`\n    This means the second planet can be at most 5 times farther from the star than the first planet and still have its center transit the star.\n\n7.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`P² ∝ a³`). We can write this as a ratio for our two planets:\n    `(P2 / P1)² = (a2 / a1)³`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Maximum Orbital Period for Planet 2:** Substitute the known values and the maximum ratio of the semi-major axes into Kepler's law to find the maximum period for Planet 2 (`P2_max`):\n    `(P2_max / 3 days)² = (5)³`\n    `(P2_max / 3)² = 125`\n    `P2_max² = 125 * (3 days)²`\n    `P2_max² = 125 * 9 = 1125`\n    `P2_max = √1125`\n    `P2_max ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet to exhibit transit and occultation events is approximately 33.5 days.\n\n<<<A>>>"
