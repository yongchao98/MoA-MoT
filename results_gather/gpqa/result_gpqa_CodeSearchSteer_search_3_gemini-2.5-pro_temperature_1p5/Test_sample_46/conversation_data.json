    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct compound.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating the DoU is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl group C=O) or another ring.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** These two distinct bands in the N-H stretching region are characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The two bands arise from the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, this value is characteristic of an α,β-unsaturated ester, such as an ester directly attached to a benzene ring. Saturated esters usually appear at a slightly higher frequency (1735-1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet with an integration of 3H strongly suggests a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2). This is a classic pattern for an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet with an integration of 2H is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2) next to a methyl group (-CH3). The chemical shift of 4.5 ppm indicates that this methylene group is attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen atom in an ester linkage (R-O-CH2-CH3).\n*   **Combined Analysis of 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm signals:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm together are definitive evidence for an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2H is indicative of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and exchange with trace amounts of water. The chemical shift around 4.0 ppm is typical for an amino group on an aromatic ring.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two doublets arise from the two sets of chemically equivalent aromatic protons. The downfield shift of one doublet (8.0 ppm) is due to the deshielding effect of an electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the upfield shift of the other doublet (7.0 ppm) is due to the shielding effect of an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n### **4. Assembling the Pieces and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The molecule has a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   The molecule has an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   The molecule has a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** An ethyl group is attached to a carboxylate, which is attached to a benzene ring at position 1. An amino group is at position 4.\n    *   **Matches the data:**\n        *   Formula: C9H11NO2 (Correct)\n        *   IR: Primary -NH2 (two bands around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹) and a conjugated C=O stretch (~1720 cm⁻¹). This is a perfect match.\n        *   ¹H NMR: An ethyl group (triplet and quartet), a primary amine (broad singlet), and two doublets for a para-substituted ring. This also perfectly matches the given data.\n\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:**\n    *   **Structure:** An ethoxy group and an amide group are in a meta relationship on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Doesn't match:** This is a primary amide (-CONH2), which would also show two N-H bands in the IR. However, the C=O stretch of an amide is typically at a lower frequency (around 1650 cm⁻¹). The NMR would show signals for an ethoxy group, but the aromatic region would be more complex than two doublets, and there would be no separate -NH2 signal in the 4.0 ppm region.\n\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a secondary amide (formamide).\n    *   **Doesn't match:** A secondary amide has only one N-H bond and would therefore show only one N-H stretch in the IR spectrum, not two.\n\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:**\n    *   **Structure:** A propionate group is attached to the oxygen of a phenol, which also has an amino group at the para position. The ester is an aryl ester, not an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Doesn't match:** This structure would not give the characteristic ethyl group signals (triplet and quartet) in the ¹H NMR spectrum. Instead, it would show an ethyl group attached to a carbonyl, resulting in a quartet and a triplet at different chemical shifts.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe data overwhelmingly supports the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The IR and ¹H NMR data are in complete agreement with this structure, including the primary amine, the ethyl ester, and the para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring. Spectroscopic data found in the literature for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirms this identification.\n\n<<<A>>>"
