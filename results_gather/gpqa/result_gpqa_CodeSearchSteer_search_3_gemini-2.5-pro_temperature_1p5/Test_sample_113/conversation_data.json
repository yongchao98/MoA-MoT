    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reagents required for each reaction:\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. It involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n\n1.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The cyanide ion from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbon of the ketone's carbonyl group. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n2.  **Protonation:** The negatively charged oxygen on the alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin. Reagent A must be a proton source. An acidic workup (providing H⁺) is necessary. H₃O⁺ is a common representation for a strong acid in an aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄) and is a suitable proton source for this step.\n\nTherefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n1.  **Hydrolysis:** The conversion of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating.\n2.  **Reagent B:** The options for reagent B are a strong acid (HCl) or a weak acid (CH₃COOH). For the hydrolysis of a nitrile to proceed efficiently to a carboxylic acid, a strong acid like HCl is the standard and effective choice.\n\nTherefore, **B = HCl**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<A>>>"
