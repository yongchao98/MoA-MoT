    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\n    This is the electrophilic aromatic nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-directing group. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the major product is p-nitrotoluene.\n    *   **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).**\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.**\n    This step involves the oxidation of the methyl group on the nitrated ring. While these conditions can lead to a carboxylic acid, manganese dioxide (MnO₂) is often used for the selective oxidation of benzylic methyl groups to aldehydes. For the subsequent reaction to proceed as a standard named reaction, the formation of an aldehyde is the most logical outcome.\n    *   **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).**\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\n    This is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, which is a specific type of crossed aldol condensation. The base, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), removes an acidic α-proton from acetone to form an enolate nucleophile. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting intermediate β-hydroxy ketone readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   **Product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.**\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\nThe final product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Let's analyze its structure for symmetry elements.\n\n*   The molecule has an extended system of alternating single and double bonds (p-nitrophenyl ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond). This conjugation favors a planar geometry for the main framework of the molecule.\n*   Assuming a planar conformation, the entire plane of the molecule acts as a mirror plane (a plane of symmetry, denoted as σ).\n*   The molecule does not possess any axes of rotation (other than the trivial C₁ axis) or a center of inversion.\n\nA molecule that possesses only an identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<B>>>"
