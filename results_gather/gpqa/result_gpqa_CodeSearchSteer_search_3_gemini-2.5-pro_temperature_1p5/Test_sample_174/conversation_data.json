    "An oscillating charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves. The problem specifies a spheroid shape with the z-axis as the symmetry axis. In the absence of further information, the most fundamental and dominant mode of radiation is electric dipole radiation.\n\n### Analysis based on Electric Dipole Radiation\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence of Power:** For a simple electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) is proportional to sin²θ, where θ is the angle with the z-axis. The formula is:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²θ`\n\n2.  **Maximum Power:** The radiated power is maximum when sin²θ is maximum. The maximum value of sin²θ is 1, which occurs at θ = 90° (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis). Let this maximum power be A.\n\n3.  **Power at θ = 30°:** We need to find the fraction of the maximum power that is radiated at an angle of 30°.\n    *   Power at 30°: `P(30°) ∝ sin²(30°)`\n    *   Since sin(30°) = 1/2, then sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power A is `P(30°)/A = sin²(30°)/1 = 1/4`.\n\n4.  **Wavelength (λ) Dependence:** The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency ω (`P ∝ ω⁴`). The angular frequency is related to the wavelength λ by `ω = 2πc/λ`, where c is the speed of light.\n    *   Substituting this into the power relation, we get `P ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   This is the well-known wavelength dependence for Rayleigh scattering, which applies to radiation from sources much smaller than the wavelength.\n\n### Alternative: Electric Quadrupole Radiation\n\nIf the spheroid were to oscillate in a way that its dipole moment is zero (e.g., deforming from prolate to oblate), the next dominant term would be electric quadrupole radiation.\n*   **Angular Dependence:** For a linear electric quadrupole along the z-axis, the power is proportional to `sin²θ cos²θ`. The maximum power occurs at θ = 45°. The fraction of maximum power at θ = 30° would be `(sin²(30°)cos²(30°)) / (sin²(45°)cos²(45°))` which is `( (1/4) * (3/4) ) / ( (1/2) * (1/2) ) = 3/4`.\n*   **Wavelength Dependence:** The power for electric quadrupole radiation is proportional to `ω⁶`, which corresponds to `λ⁻⁶`. This would lead to the answer (3/4, λ⁻⁶), which is option D.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince electric dipole radiation is the most fundamental and typically dominant form of radiation for a simple oscillating charge distribution, this interpretation is the most likely intended one for the problem. This leads to a power fraction of 1/4 at 30° and a wavelength dependence of λ⁻⁴.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of A radiated at an angle θ = 30⁰ and the possible form of f are 1/4 and λ⁻⁴, respectively.\n\n<<<C>>>"
