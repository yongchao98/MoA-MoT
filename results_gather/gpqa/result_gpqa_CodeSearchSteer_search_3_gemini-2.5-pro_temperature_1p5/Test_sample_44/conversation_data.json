    "To determine the energies of the system, we must consider the energy levels of a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well and then fill these levels with the four identical spin-1/2 particles according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit E as:\nE = π²ħ² / 2mL²\n\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels (E_n) can be expressed as:\nE_n = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n### Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 fermions, which are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Since spin is a quantum number, each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Calculation of State Energies\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.\n\n**1. Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **Level n=1:** Can hold two particles (spin up and spin down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** Can hold the remaining two particles (spin up and spin down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₂ = 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**2. First Excited State Energy**\n\nTo get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **Level n=1:** Still holds two particles. Energy = 2 × E₁ = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** Now holds one particle. Energy = 1 × E₂ = 1 × (2²E) = 4E.\n*   **Level n=3:** Now holds one particle. Energy = 1 × E₃ = 1 × (3²E) = 9E.\n\nThe total first excited state energy is the sum:\nE_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**3. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. We must consider the different possibilities for exciting particles from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility A:** Excite a particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration would be: two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be: two particles in n=1, two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration would be: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E), the third lowest energy for the system corresponds to the second excited state.\nE_second_excited = 18E.\n\nThus, the energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
