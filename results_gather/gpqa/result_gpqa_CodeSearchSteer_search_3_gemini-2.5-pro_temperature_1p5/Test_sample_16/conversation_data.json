    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in a solution of calcium-EDTA complex, we need to consider the dissociation of the complex.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   Stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 M\n*   Formation constant for Ca-EDTA, Kf = 5 x 10¹⁰\n*   The temperature is 25 °C and the pH is assumed to be ideal, meaning the EDTA is fully deprotonated and available to bind with calcium.\n\n**1. Dissociation Reaction and Equilibrium Constant:**\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the reaction:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe dissociation is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (Kd) is the reciprocal of the formation constant (Kf):\nKd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**2. Setting up the Equilibrium Expression:**\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nThe expression for the dissociation constant (Kd) is:\nKd = \\[[Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]] / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n\n**3. Calculation:**\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the Kd expression:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the formation constant (Kf) is very large, the dissociation constant (Kd) is very small. This implies that the complex will only dissociate to a very small extent. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the simplifying assumption that:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nSolve for x:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx ≈ √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 1.0x10⁻² M\nD) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
