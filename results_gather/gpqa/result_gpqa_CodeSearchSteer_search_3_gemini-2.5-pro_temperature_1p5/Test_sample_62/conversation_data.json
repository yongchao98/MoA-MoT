    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to calculate the energy of the transition from the molecule's fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy.\n\n### 1. Model and Energy Levels\nThe molecule is described by the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy of a particular state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...), is given by:\n\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B·J(J+1)\n\nwhere:\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   ω is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   B is the rotational constant, `B = ħ² / 2I`\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n\nThe fundamental (ground) state is where `v=0` and `J=0`.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\nFor a photon to be absorbed and induce a transition, spectroscopic selection rules must be followed. For rovibrational transitions in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`.\n\nStarting from the ground state (`v=0`, `J=0`), the molecule must transition to the next vibrational level (`v=1`). The selection rule `ΔJ = ±1` means the rotational quantum number `J` must change to `J=1` (as `J=-1` is not possible).\n\nTherefore, the transition is from the initial state `(v=0, J=0)` to the final state `(v=1, J=1)`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)\nThe energy of the initial state is:\nE_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B·0(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n\nThe energy of the final state is:\nE_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B·1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between these two levels:\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ] = ħω + 2B\n\nThis energy can be approximated as just `ħω` because the rotational energy (`2B`) is typically much smaller than the vibrational energy (`ħω`).\n\n### 4. Numerical Calculation\nFirst, we calculate the energy jump due to vibration `ħω`:\n*   ħ = 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   **ΔE ≈ ħω** = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ s⁻¹) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 5. Calculating Photon Momentum (p)\nThe momentum of a photon is related to its energy by the equation `p = E/c`, where `c` is the speed of light (≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s).\n\n*   p ≈ (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   p ≈ 1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis result is approximately 1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s.\n\n(Note: A more precise calculation would include the rotational energy term `2B = ħ²/I`. First, the reduced mass `μ` is calculated as `(Mx*My)/(Mx+My)` = 1.818 amu or 3.02 x 10⁻²⁷ kg. The moment of inertia `I = μR²` is then `(3.02 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`. This gives a rotational energy correction that is very small compared to the vibrational energy and does not change the result to two significant figures.)\n\n<<<A>>>"
