    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the electric field at point P:\n\n1.  **Induced Charges:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity of the uncharged spherical conductor will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. Therefore, a charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface.\n2.  **Charge Neutrality:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall charge neutrality, since a `-q` charge has been induced on the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges placed inside it. The conductor prevents the electric field from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface from reaching the region outside the conductor.\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the spherical shape of the conductor and the shielding effect, the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly, regardless of the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere (this is a result from Gauss's Law). Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface. This is equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` located at the center of the spherical conductor.\n6.  **Calculating the Magnitude:** The distance from the center of the spherical conductor to point P is given as `L`. Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n    The variables `l`, `s`, and `Î¸` which describe the position of the cavity and the point P relative to the cavity are irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor due to electrostatic shielding.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, option D matches the derived expression.\n\n<<<D>>>"
