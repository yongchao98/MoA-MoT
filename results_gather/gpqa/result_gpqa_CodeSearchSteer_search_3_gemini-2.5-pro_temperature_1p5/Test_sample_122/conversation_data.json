    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   **Galaxy Reference Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference from which we want to measure the distance traveled by the ejecta.\n    *   **Ejecta Reference Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. It is moving at a velocity `v` relative to the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   **Velocity (v):** The problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. By the principle of relativity, the velocity of the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's frame is also `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time measured in the ejecta's own reference frame is 50 seconds. This is the proper time, so `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   **Speed of Light (c):** We will use the standard value `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Concept of Time Dilation:**\n    According to the theory of special relativity, time passes slower for a moving object as measured by a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The time elapsed in the stationary frame (the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`) is related to the proper time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame, `Δt₀`) by the following formula:\n\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor depends on the velocity `v` and the speed of light `c`. It is calculated as:\n\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n    `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Reference Frame (Δt):**\n    Using the time dilation formula from Step 2, we can find the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame:\n\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Reference Frame:**\n    The distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in that same frame.\n\n    `Distance = v * Δt`\n    `Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\n    Alternatively, using the exact formula:\n    `Distance = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `Distance = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `Distance = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `Distance ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n    `Distance ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. Comparing this with the given choices:\n    A) 3,000,000 km\n    B) 2,880,000 km\n    C) 2,940,000 km\n    D) 3,060,000 km\n\n    The calculated value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
