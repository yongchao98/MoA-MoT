    "To determine the time it will take for the 22-year-old astronaut to reach Earth, we need to calculate the effects of time dilation at the specified speed. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)**\nThe LMC is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Its distance from Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years. More precise measurements, using various astronomical methods like observing Cepheid variable stars and eclipsing binaries, place the distance at about 49.97 kiloparsecs, which translates to roughly 163,000 light-years. For our calculation, we will use the value of 163,000 light-years.\n\n**2. Time of Travel from Earth's Perspective**\nFrom the reference frame of an observer on Earth, the time it would take for the spacecraft to travel 163,000 light-years at a speed of 0.99999987*c* is calculated as follows:\n\n*   Time = Distance / Speed\n*   Time ≈ 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987*c*\n*   Time ≈ 163,000.02 years\n\nFrom Earth's perspective, the journey takes just over 163,000 years.\n\n**3. Calculating Time Dilation for the Astronaut**\nDue to the effects of special relativity, time for the astronaut on the fast-moving spacecraft (proper time, Δt₀) passes slower than for a stationary observer on Earth (observed time, Δt). The relationship is defined by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\nFirst, we calculate the Lorentz factor:\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999974)\n*   γ = 1 / √0.00000026\n*   γ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\n*   γ ≈ 1961.17\n\nNow, we can calculate the time experienced by the astronaut:\n*   Astronaut's Time (Δt₀) = Earth Time (Δt) / γ\n*   Astronaut's Time ≈ 163,000.02 years / 1961.17\n*   Astronaut's Time ≈ 83.11 years\n\nThe journey will take approximately 83.11 years from the astronaut's point of view. However, considering the potential variance in the LMC's exact distance (which can be between 160,000 and 163,000 light-years), a journey time of around 81 to 83 years is a reasonable estimate. For instance, using a distance of 160,000 light-years yields a travel time of approximately 81.58 years.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe astronaut is 22 years old and has a lifespan of 150 years, meaning they can live for another 128 years. Since the journey will take approximately 81-83 years from their perspective, the astronaut will survive the trip to Earth. The calculated time is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
