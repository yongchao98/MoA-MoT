    "The user wants me to identify the correct equation relating the temperatures of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms.\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in a stellar photosphere, which is governed by the Boltzmann distribution, especially since LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) is assumed.\n\n2.  **Write the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level 2) to the number of atoms in a lower state (level 1) is given by:\n    `N_2 / N_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `N_2`, `N_1` are the populations of the levels.\n    *   `g_2`, `g_1` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels (`E_2 - E_1`).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to both stars:**\n    *   For Star 1 (temperature T_1): The excitation level is `(N_2 / N_1)_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`.\n    *   For Star 2 (temperature T_2): The excitation level is `(N_2 / N_1)_2 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`.\n\n4.  **Use the information from the problem:** It is stated that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This means:\n    `(N_2 / N_1)_1 = 2 * (N_2 / N_1)_2`\n\n5.  **Set up the equation:**\n    `(g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for statistical weights `(g_2 / g_1)` is the same for the iron atoms in both stars and cancels out.\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n7.  **Isolate the exponential terms:**\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2`\n\n8.  **Combine the exponents:** Using the rule `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n    `exp( (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ) = 2`\n    `exp( (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_2 - 1 / T_1) ) = 2`\n\n9.  **Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:**\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_2 - 1 / T_1)`\n\n10. **Use the given values:**\n    *   Energy difference `ΔE` is given as approximately `1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant `k` is a fundamental constant with a value defined as exactly `1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`. For the purpose of this problem, the given `ΔE` is numerically equal to `k`.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately 1 (with units of Kelvin, which is dimensionally consistent, but for the formula, it's just 1).\n\n11. **Substitute and finalize the equation:**\n    `ln(2) = 1 * (1 / T_2 - 1 / T_1)`\n    Combine the terms in the parenthesis:\n    `1 / T_2 - 1 / T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n    So, the final equation is:\n    `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\n12. **Compare with the options:**\n    *   A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Incorrect.\n    *   B) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] - Incorrect.\n    *   C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Correct.\n    *   D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] - Incorrect.\n\nThe derivation is confirmed. The key was the application of the Boltzmann equation to a ratio of two systems and the specific values provided for `ΔE` and `k`.\n\nTo answer this question, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The assumption that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows us to apply this equation.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation for the ratio of atoms in an excited energy state (N_j) to a lower energy state (N_i) is:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant, which has a defined value of 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n*   `T` is the temperature.\n\nLet's denote the excitation level (the ratio N_j/N_i) for star_1 and star_2. The energy level `j` is the specific excited level mentioned, and `i` is a reference lower level, typically the ground state.\n\nFor star_1, with effective temperature T_1:\n(Excitation)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n\nFor star_2, with effective temperature T_2:\n(Excitation)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\nThe problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. This means:\n(Excitation)_1 = 2 * (Excitation)_2\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann expressions:\n(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g_j / g_i) is identical for both stars and cancels out:\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\nNow, we solve for the temperatures. First, rearrange the equation:\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2\n\nUsing the exponential property exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a-b):\nexp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ] = 2\nexp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] = 2\n\nTake the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nThe problem provides a crucial piece of information: the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. As noted, the Boltzmann constant `k` is 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE/k` is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting `ΔE/k ≈ 1` into the equation:\nln(2) = 1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nFinally, we combine the terms in the parenthesis:\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
