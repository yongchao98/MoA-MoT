    "To determine which molecule has C3h symmetry, we must identify the one that possesses a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (ﾏド) perpendicular to that axis.\n\n*   **Triisopropyl borate (D):** This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. While the B(O)3 core might be planar, the isopropyl groups are bulky and their hydrogen atoms prevent the existence of a horizontal mirror plane. The molecule will adopt a conformation to minimize steric hindrance, which is not C3h.\n\n*   **Quinuclidine (A):** This is a bicyclic amine, also known as 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a clear C3 rotational axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon. However, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to this axis. Therefore, its point group is C3v.\n\n*   **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (C):** This molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride, consists of a central benzene ring fused to three anhydride rings. While it has a three-fold axis of rotation, the molecule is not planar. The anhydride groups cause the oxygen atoms to pucker out of the main plane, which eliminates the possibility of a horizontal mirror plane (ﾏド).\n\n*   **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (B):** This is a larger, disc-shaped molecule built on a triphenylene core. The molecule is planar and possesses a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane. Crucially, the entire molecule lies within a plane, which acts as a horizontal mirror plane (ﾏド). The combination of the C3 axis and the ﾏド plane confers C3h symmetry to the molecule.\n\nTherefore, triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone is the molecule with C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
