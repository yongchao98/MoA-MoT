    "My initial analysis was based on established physics principles: the formula for geometric transit probability and Kepler's Third Law. The search results confirm these principles.\n\n*   **Transit Probability:** Multiple sources confirm that for a planet on a circular orbit, the geometric transit probability (p_trans) is approximated by the ratio of the star's radius (R_s) to the planet's semi-major axis (a). Specifically, one source gives the formula for the relative transit duration as Δt/P ≈ R_s / (πa), and the probability is directly related to this. Another states the probability is R_s/a. The general concept is that the probability decreases as the orbital period (and thus the semi-major axis) increases.\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** The relationship between orbital period (P), semi-major axis (a), and the mass of the central body (M_s) is also well-established. The law states that P² is proportional to a³ / M_s. This can be rearranged to show that 'a' is proportional to (M_s * P²)^(1/3), which is the exact relationship I used in my initial derivation.\n\nThe initial reasoning, therefore, stands as correct and well-supported by fundamental astronomical principles confirmed by the search results.\n\n**Recap of the calculation:**\n1.  Transit probability ratio: Prob1 / Prob2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)\n2.  Given R_s1 = R_s2, the ratio simplifies to: Prob1 / Prob2 = a2 / a1\n3.  From Kepler's Third Law (a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)), the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    a2 / a1 = [(M_s2 * P2²) / (M_s1 * P1²)]^(1/3)\n4.  Substituting the given relationships (M_s1 = 2 * M_s2 and P1 = P2 / 3, which means P2 = 3 * P1):\n    a2 / a1 = [(M_s2 * (3*P1)²) / ((2*M_s2) * P1²)]^(1/3)\n5.  Simplifying the expression:\n    a2 / a1 = [9 * M_s2 * P1² / (2 * M_s2 * P1²)]^(1/3)\n    a2 / a1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)\n6.  Calculating the final value:\n    4.5^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096\n\nThe probability of Planet_1 transiting is ~1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
