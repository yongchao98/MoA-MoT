    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Product 1\n\nThe reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at high temperature (240°C) is a complex process. The provided spectroscopic data for product 1 is key to its identification:\n*   **IR Spectrum:** A strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone in a strained ring.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The presence of a signal at 4.79 ppm for two protons (2H) is highly indicative of vinylic protons of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂). The remaining 12 protons are in the aliphatic region (2.41-1.94 ppm).\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂), is transformed into product 1 (C₁₀H₁₄O). The reaction involves the removal of two bromine atoms and two hydrogen atoms, and the addition of one oxygen atom. This change corresponds to the formation of one C=O group and one C=C double bond, which requires a rearrangement of the adamantane skeleton.\n\nThese data are inconsistent with a simple adamantanone structure. Instead, they strongly suggest a fragmentation of the adamantane cage followed by cyclization. The structure that fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This β,γ-unsaturated ketone features a strained bicyclic system (consistent with IR at 1720 cm⁻¹) and an exocyclic methylene group whose two vinylic protons account for the signal at 4.79 ppm. This compound is a known product from the fragmentation of 1,3-adamantanediol (which can be formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane).\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Product 2\n\nProduct 1 is treated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**. This reaction selectively reduces aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols. Importantly, it does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n\nTherefore, the ketone group in 7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one is reduced to a hydroxyl group, yielding **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol** as product 2.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying Product 3 and Analyzing its NMR Spectrum\n\nProduct 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. The exocyclic methylene group (C=CH₂) of product 2 is cleaved to form a ketone (C=O) at that position.\n\nThus, 7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol is converted into **3-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**. This is product 3.\n\nTo determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton), we must analyze its structure:\n1.  **Most Deshielded C-H Proton:** The most deshielded carbon-bound proton will be the one on the carbon bearing the electron-withdrawing hydroxyl group (H-C-OH). This is the proton at the C3 position (H3). Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm, significantly more deshielded than the protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8), which would be around 2.2-2.8 ppm.\n2.  **Coupling of H3:** The coupling (splitting) pattern of H3 is determined by its neighboring protons. The C3 carbon is bonded to C2 and C4. In the stable double-chair or chair-boat conformation of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring system, the molecule possesses symmetry, making the two protons on C2 equivalent to the two protons on C4. Therefore, H3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n3.  **Coupling Pattern:** These four neighboring protons are not all magnetically equivalent to H3. In the common chair conformation of the six-membered ring containing C3, there are two axial protons (one on C2, one on C4) and two equatorial protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   H3 will have a large coupling constant (J_ax) with the two axial neighbors due to an anti-periplanar (approx. 180°) dihedral angle.\n    *   H3 will have a smaller coupling constant (J_eq) with the two equatorial neighbors due to a synclinal (approx. 60°) dihedral angle.\n    *   Since H3 couples to two sets of equivalent protons with different coupling constants (J_ax ≠ J_eq), its signal is split into a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
