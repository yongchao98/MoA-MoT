    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**: The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n. For any such cycloalkane, the mass percentage of hydrogen is (2n / (12n + 2n)) * 100 = (2n / 14n) * 100 = (1/7) * 100 ≈ 14.28%. The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent and is formed by the hydrogenation of all other compounds, suggesting a stable structure. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and cyclopentane (C5H10). Both are used as solvents.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**: An equimolar mixture X of two unsaturated liquids is heated with platinum, causing a disproportionation reaction to form an equimolar mixture Y of two saturated liquids. A disproportionation reaction is one where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses hydrogen) and reduced (gains hydrogen).\n\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis**: Let's assume the reaction is of the type:\n    2 * (Reactant) → (Reduced Product) + (Oxidized Product)\n    Since mixture X contains two equimolar liquids (X1 and X2), the reaction is likely X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2. As X1 and X2 are isomers that both hydrogenate to Z, it's reasonable to assume they have the same molecular formula. Let this be CnHx.\n    Mixture Y contains Z (Y1 = CnH2n) and another saturated compound (Y2).\n    So, the overall reaction becomes: 2 * CnHx → CnH2n + CnH(2x-2n).\n\n4.  **Test the Hypothesis with Cyclohexane (n=6)**:\n    *   If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then the reaction is 2 * C6Hx → C6H12 + C6H(2x-12).\n    *   Y2, which is C6H(2x-12), must be a saturated hydrocarbon. Saturated C6 hydrocarbons include bicyclic alkanes (C6H10) and tricyclic alkanes (C6H8).\n    *   If Y2 = C6H10 (bicyclic), then 2x-12 = 10, which means x = 11. A C6H11 compound is a radical, which is unlikely for a stable liquid.\n    *   If Y2 = C6H8 (tricyclic), then 2x-12 = 8, which means x = 10. The reactants in mixture X would be isomers of C6H10.\n    *   This leads to a total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X as 10 + 10 = 20. This answer is not among the options (A, B, C, D).\n\n5.  **Test the Hypothesis with Cyclopentane (n=5)**:\n    *   If Z is cyclopentane (C5H10), then the reaction is 2 * C5Hx → C5H10 + C5H(2x-10).\n    *   Y2, which is C5H(2x-10), must be a saturated hydrocarbon. Saturated C5 hydrocarbons can be bicyclic (C5H8) or tricyclic (C5H6).\n    *   If Y2 = C5H8 (bicyclic), then 2x-10 = 8, which means x = 9. A C5H9 compound is a radical, which is unlikely.\n    *   If Y2 = C5H6 (tricyclic), then 2x-10 = 6, which means x = 8. The reactants in mixture X would be isomers of C5H8.\n    *   This scenario is plausible. The components of mixture X (X1 and X2) would both have the formula C5H8. Examples of non-conjugated C5H8 isomers include cyclopentene, 1,4-pentadiene, and methylenecyclobutane.\n\n6.  **Verify the C5 Hypothesis**:\n    *   **Mixture X**: An equimolar mixture of two C5H8 isomers (e.g., cyclopentene and vinylcyclopropane). It is unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Reaction**: The disproportionation reaction is C5H8 + C5H8 → C5H10 + C5H6.\n    *   **Mixture Y**: An equimolar mixture of cyclopentane (C5H10, which is Z) and a saturated tricyclic alkane (C5H6). This mixture is saturated and will not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Hydrogenation**: Hydrogenation of X (C5H8) gives cyclopentane (C5H10), which is Z. Hydrogenation of Y (C5H10 and C5H6) also gives only cyclopentane (Z) under severe conditions, which involves the ring-opening of the C5H6 component.\n    *   All conditions of the problem are met with this hypothesis.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Liquid 1 (X1) has the formula C5H8, so it has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (X2) has the formula C5H8, so it has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 8 = 16.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
