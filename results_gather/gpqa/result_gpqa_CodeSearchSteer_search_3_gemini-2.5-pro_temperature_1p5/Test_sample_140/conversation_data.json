    "The reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The amide ion (NH2-), a strong base, initiates the reaction by removing a proton or deuteron from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom.\n\nIn the case of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two possible sites for this initial abstraction:\n1.  **Removal of a hydrogen atom (H) from C6:** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, making this the kinetically favored pathway. This elimination of H from C6 and Br from C1 results in an intermediate called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Removal of a deuterium atom (D) from C2:** While slower due to the stronger C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), this pathway is still possible. This elimination removes the deuterium atom entirely, leading to a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nOnce these two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed, the amide ion (NH2-), acting as a nucleophile, attacks them. This leads to the formation of different products:\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne:** The amide ion can attack either of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond.\n    *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n*   **Attack on the non-deuterated benzyne:** The amide ion attacks the symmetrical benzyne intermediate, and after protonation by the ammonia solvent, the sole product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\nTherefore, combining the outcomes of both possible initial steps, a total of three distinct organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-deuteroaniline\n*   3-deuteroaniline\n\nThis makes for a total of three possible organic products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
