    "An N-sided regular polygon with apothems of a constant length 'a' will approach the shape of a circle as the number of sides, N, approaches infinity. The radius of this circle will be equal to the apothem, 'a'.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'. This pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\nThe angular positions of the minima (the dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The intensity of the diffraction pattern is zero when J₁(ka sinθ) = 0, where 'k' is the wavenumber (2π/λ), 'a' is the radius of the aperture, and θ is the angle of diffraction.\n\nThe condition for the minima can be written as:\nka sinθ = xₙ\n(2π/λ)a sinθ = xₙ\n\nwhere xₙ are the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x). Using the small angle approximation (sinθ ≈ θ), we get:\nθₙ = (xₙ * λ) / (2πa)\n\nThe first two zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x) are approximately:\n*   x₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   x₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first two minima:\n*   **First minimum (θ₁):**\n    θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2πa) ≈ 0.6098 λ/a ≈ 0.610 λ/a\n\n*   **Second minimum (θ₂):**\n    θ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2πa) ≈ 1.1166 λ/a\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\nΔθ ≈ (1.1166 λ/a) - (0.610 λ/a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5066 λ/a\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ /a\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.506 λ/a matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
