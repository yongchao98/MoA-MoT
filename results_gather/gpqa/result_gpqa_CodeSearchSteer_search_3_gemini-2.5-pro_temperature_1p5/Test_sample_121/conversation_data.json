    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of hydrogen signals in the final product's ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Reaction Sequence Analysis\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) undergoes an α-halogenation reaction when treated with bromine (Br₂) and a catalyst like phosphorus tribromide (which can be generated in situ). The given reagents (bromine, pyridine, acetic anhydride) will achieve the same outcome. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid is brominated, yielding **bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH)**.\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Bromoacetic acid (Product 1) is then heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester. The product is **ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Product 2) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction. This yields **ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n4.  **Product 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (Product 3) has acidic protons on the α-carbon (the CH₂ group) due to the electron-withdrawing effects of both the cyano and the ester groups. It is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, which deprotonates the α-carbon. The resulting carbanion then reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane. This reaction proceeds via a two-step process:\n    *   **First, an intermolecular alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   **Second, an intramolecular cyclization:** The excess sodium hydride deprotonates the newly substituted α-carbon again. The resulting carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a stable six-membered ring. This intramolecular cyclization is known as the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n    The final product, **Product 4**, is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n### ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\nThe structure consists of an ethyl group and a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-CH₂CH₃):** Due to free rotation, the three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent, giving one signal. The two protons of the methylene (-CH₂) group are also equivalent, giving a second signal.\n    *   **2 signals** from the ethyl group.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring:** At room temperature, cyclohexane and its derivatives undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. However, the presence of two bulky substituents on a single carbon (C1) significantly hinders this flipping motion, raising the energy barrier for interconversion. On the NMR timescale, the conformation can be considered \"frozen\" or in slow exchange.\n\n    In a fixed chair conformation, the molecule is chiral (it lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion). In a chiral molecule, protons that cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation are chemically non-equivalent (diastereotopic).\n\n    Let's analyze the 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring in this \"frozen\" chiral state:\n    *   **C2 and C6 protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are distinct. Similarly, the axial and equatorial protons on C6 are distinct. Because the molecule is chiral, the environment of the C2 protons is different from the C6 protons. Therefore, all four protons (axial-C2, equatorial-C2, axial-C6, equatorial-C6) are chemically distinct. This gives **4 signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5 protons:** By the same logic, the four protons on C3 and C5 are all chemically distinct. This gives another **4 signals**.\n    *   **C4 protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on C4 are in different chemical environments and are therefore distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Signals:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n    *   From the C2/C6 positions: 4 signals\n    *   From the C3/C5 positions: 4 signals\n    *   From the C4 position: 2 signals\n\n    Total = 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 = **12 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
