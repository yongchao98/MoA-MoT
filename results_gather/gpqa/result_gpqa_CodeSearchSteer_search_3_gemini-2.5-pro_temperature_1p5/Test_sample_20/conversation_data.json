    "### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where structures can interconvert through the migration of a proton, typically accompanied by a shift in double bonds. A common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** In this molecule, the carbon atoms adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Because it lacks alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has CH2 groups at positions 2, 4, and 6, which are alpha to the carbonyl groups. These carbons have acidic alpha-hydrogens. This allows the molecule to undergo tautomerism to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral centerâ€”a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). Since this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioate. It features a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. As it is superimposable on its mirror image, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
