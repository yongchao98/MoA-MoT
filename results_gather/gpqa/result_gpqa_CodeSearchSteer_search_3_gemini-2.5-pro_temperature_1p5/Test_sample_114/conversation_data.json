    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the angle between the two photons:\n\n### 1. Define Initial Conditions\n*   An electron moves from left to right (+x direction) with a Lorentz factor γ_e = 4.\n*   A positron moves from right to left (-x direction) with a Lorentz factor γ_p = 2.\n*   The electron and positron have the same rest mass, denoted as *m*.\n\n### 2. Conservation of Energy\nThe total energy before the collision equals the total energy after the collision. The relativistic energy of a particle is given by E = γmc².\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):**\n    *   Energy of the electron: E_e = γ_e * m * c² = 4mc²\n    *   Energy of the positron: E_p = γ_p * m * c² = 2mc²\n    *   Total initial energy: E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):**\n    *   After annihilation, two photons are produced. Since their energies are equal, let's call the energy of each photon E_γ.\n    *   Total final energy: E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ\n\n*   **Equating Energies:**\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   6mc² = 2E_γ\n    *   **E_γ = 3mc²** (This is the energy of each photon)\n\n### 3. Conservation of Momentum\nThe total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision. The magnitude of relativistic momentum is p = mc√(γ² - 1).\n\n*   **Initial Momentum (p_initial):**\n    *   Momentum is a vector. We'll consider the horizontal (x) direction.\n    *   Electron's momentum (in the +x direction): p_e = m * c * √(γ_e² - 1) = mc√(4² - 1) = mc√15\n    *   Positron's momentum (in the -x direction): p_p = -m * c * √(γ_p² - 1) = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3\n    *   Total initial momentum: **p_initial = mc(√15 - √3)**\n\n*   **Final Momentum (p_final):**\n    *   The two photons move away from the collision point. Let θ be the angle of each photon's path with respect to the initial horizontal axis. Due to momentum conservation in the vertical direction, the angles must be equal and opposite (+θ and -θ).\n    *   The momentum of a photon is p_γ = E_γ / c. From our energy calculation, p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc.\n    *   The horizontal component of momentum for each photon is p_γ * cos(θ).\n    *   Total final momentum (horizontal): **p_final = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ) = 6mc * cos(θ)**\n\n*   **Equating Momenta:**\n    *   p_initial = p_final\n    *   mc(√15 - √3) = 6mc * cos(θ)\n\n### 4. Calculate the Angle\nNow, we can solve for the angle θ.\n\n*   Divide both sides by *mc*:\n    *   √15 - √3 = 6 * cos(θ)\n*   Solve for cos(θ):\n    *   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n*   Calculate the numerical value:\n    *   √15 ≈ 3.873\n    *   √3 ≈ 1.732\n    *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n*   Find the angle θ:\n    *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\n\n*   **Angle between photons = 2 * θ = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\n<<<A>>>"
