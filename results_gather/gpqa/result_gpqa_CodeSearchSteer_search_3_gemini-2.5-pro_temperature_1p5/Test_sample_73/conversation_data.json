    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Principle: The Memoryless Property of Radioactive Decay\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process governed by the exponential distribution. A key characteristic of this distribution is the \"memoryless property\". This principle states that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is constant and is not affected by how long the atom has already existed. In this problem, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\n\n### 2. Determining the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nThe probability of an atom surviving (not decaying) for a time `t` is given by the formula:\nP(survival) = e^(-λt)\n\nWhere λ is the decay constant. The probability of decay is therefore:\nP(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find the decay constant λ.\n\n*   P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32\n*   1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n*   e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\n*   e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probability for the New Time Interval\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is equivalent to calculating the decay probability for a fresh atom over a 150-minute period.\n\n*   P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nTo solve this, we can use the value of `e^(-100λ)` that we found in the previous step. We can rewrite the exponent `-150λ` as `(-100λ) * 1.5`.\n\n*   e^(-150λ) = e^((-100λ) * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the value `0.68` for `e^(-100λ)`:\n\n*   e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nLet's calculate the value of (0.68)^1.5:\n\n*   (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56073\n\nThis is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes. To find the probability of it *decaying*, we subtract this value from 1:\n\n*   P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.56073 ≈ 0.43927\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives approximately 43.93%.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probability of 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
