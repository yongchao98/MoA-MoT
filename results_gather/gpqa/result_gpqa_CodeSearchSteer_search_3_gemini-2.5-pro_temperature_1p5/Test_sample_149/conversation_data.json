    "The final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₉NO\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation:** (2*8 + 2 + 1 - 9) / 2 = 5. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees, suggesting a substituted benzene ring and one other double bond (e.g., C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   `9.72 (t, 1H)`: This high chemical shift and triplet splitting pattern is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   `6.98 (d, 2H)` and `6.51 (d, 2H)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   `6.27 (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for 2 protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n    *   `3.66 (d, 2H)`: A doublet for 2 protons corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to the aldehyde's methine proton (-CH).\n*   **Structure Assembly:** Combining these fragments gives 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. The structure is an acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO) and an amino group (-NH₂) attached in a para orientation on a benzene ring. This structure is consistent with the molecular formula and all NMR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence:**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl:** These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH₂) on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻), forming 4-(diazonium)phenylacetaldehyde chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H₂O:** Adding water to the diazonium salt solution (often with gentle warming) replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction converts the diazonium salt into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are classic conditions for an aldol condensation. An aldol reaction is a reaction between two molecules of an aldehyde (or ketone) that have α-hydrogens.\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** One molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde forms an enolate, which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option A).\n    2.  **Condensation (Dehydration):** The \"Heat\" condition strongly suggests that the aldol addition product will undergo dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are eliminated to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\nThe initial NMR data identifies the starting compound as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. The three-step reaction sequence first converts this to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde via a diazotization-hydrolysis sequence. The final step is a base-catalyzed self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Due to the application of heat, the final product is the dehydrated condensation product, not the simple addition product.\n\n*   Aldol addition product: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal\n*   Final condensation product: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\n\nComparing this to the given options, the final product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
