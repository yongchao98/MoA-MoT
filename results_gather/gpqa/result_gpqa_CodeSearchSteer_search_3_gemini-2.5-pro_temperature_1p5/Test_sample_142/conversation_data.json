    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the correct starting material (A) and product (B).\n\n### **Reaction 1: Determining Starting Material A**\n\nThe reaction is: A + H₂SO₄ → 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one\n\nThis reaction is a classic Pinacol rearrangement, which converts a 1,2-diol (a vicinal diol) into a ketone under acidic conditions. A key feature of this rearrangement can be the expansion or contraction of a ring system attached to the diol.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product:** The product is a cyclohexanone, a six-membered ring containing a ketone. At the carbon adjacent to the ketone (C2), there are two p-tolyl groups.\n2.  **Analyze the Rearrangement Mechanism:** The general mechanism involves protonation of a hydroxyl group, loss of water to form a carbocation, a 1,2-shift of a group (alkyl, aryl, or hydride) to the carbocation, and finally deprotonation of the remaining hydroxyl to form the ketone. Reactions involving cyclic compounds can result in ring expansion.\n3.  **Trace the Reaction Backwards:** For the product to be a cyclohexanone resulting from a ring expansion, the starting material must have contained a five-membered ring. Let's examine the cyclopentane-based option for A: `1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol`.\n    *   **Step 1: Carbocation Formation.** The starting diol has two hydroxyl groups. One is on the cyclopentane ring (a tertiary alcohol), and the other is on the side chain attached to two p-tolyl groups (a tertiary, benzylic alcohol). Protonation and loss of water will occur to form the more stable carbocation. The carbocation on the carbon bearing two phenyl (or tolyl) groups is significantly stabilized by resonance and is much more stable. Therefore, the hydroxyl group on the side chain leaves.\n    *   **Step 2: Ring Expansion.** A very stable tertiary, di-benzylic carbocation is formed on the side chain. To stabilize this cation, a group from the adjacent carbon (C1 of the cyclopentane ring) migrates. This involves the migration of one of the C-C bonds of the cyclopentane ring. This is a 1,2-alkyl shift that results in the expansion of the five-membered ring into a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Step 3: Ketone Formation.** The migration expands the ring to a cyclohexyl system and transfers the positive charge to the carbon atom that originally bore the hydroxyl group (C1). This new carbocation is immediately stabilized by the lone pair on the adjacent oxygen. Deprotonation yields the final product, 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\nTherefore, starting material **A** is **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: Determining Product B**\n\nThe reaction is: methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H₂SO₄ → B\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** The starting material is a 1,2-diol derivative of butanoic acid methyl ester. The structure is `CH₃–CH(OH)–C(OH)(p-tolyl)–COOCH₃`. The diol is on carbons C2 and C3.\n2.  **Analyze the Rearrangement Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Carbocation Formation.** The first step is the formation of a carbocation. Protonation can occur on the C2-OH or C3-OH.\n        *   Loss of water from C2 would form a tertiary, benzylic carbocation. However, it is adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (`-COOCH₃`), which is destabilizing.\n        *   Loss of water from C3 would form a secondary carbocation.\n    *   Typically, the reaction proceeds through the more stable carbocation. In cases of competing factors (like benzylic stabilization vs. inductive destabilization), we must also consider the migratory aptitude of the available groups. The general order of migratory aptitude is often cited as Hydride > Phenyl > Alkyl, though this can vary.\n    *   **Step 2: 1,2-Shift.** Let's assume the more stable tertiary, benzylic carbocation forms at C2, despite the adjacent ester group. The migrating group must then come from C3. The groups on C3 are a hydrogen atom and a methyl group. Hydride (H⁻) has a greater migratory aptitude than a methyl group.\n    *   **Step 3: Ketone Formation.** A 1,2-hydride shift from C3 to C2 occurs. This moves the positive charge to C3, where it is stabilized by the lone pair on the adjacent oxygen. Deprotonation of this oxygen results in a ketone at the C3 position.\n3.  **Identify the Product:** The resulting molecule is `CH₃–C(=O)–CH(p-tolyl)–COOCH₃`. The IUPAC name for this product is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A is **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol**.\n*   Product B is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
