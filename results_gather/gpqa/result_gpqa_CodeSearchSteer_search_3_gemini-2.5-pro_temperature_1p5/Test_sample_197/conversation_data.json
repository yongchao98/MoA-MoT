    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], in the solution, we need to calculate its mole fraction relative to all other cobalt-containing species.\n\nThe formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes is described by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺,       β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂],     β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻,   β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻,   β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its thiocyanato complexes. The fraction of each species can be determined based on the free thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻], and the stability constants.\n\nThe mole fraction (αₙ) of each complex is given by the formula:\nαₙ = (βₙ * [SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nGiven:\n*   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n*   Total thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n\nSince the thiocyanate concentration is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration, we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium to be equal to the initial total concentration, so [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator (S) of the fraction formula:\nS = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\nS = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nS = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nS = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nS = 2.3646\n\nNow, we calculate the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, α₂, which corresponds to the species [Co(SCN)₂]. The numerator for this term is β₂[SCN⁻]².\nNumerator for α₂ = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nThe fraction of [Co(SCN)₂] is:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThus, approximately 16.9% of the cobalt in the solution exists as the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n<<<B>>>"
