    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators built from Standard Model fields. The construction of this effective field theory relies on a set of foundational principles.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a quantum field theory designed to be consistent with special relativity. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars, meaning they must respect Lorentz symmetry.\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry**: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations. As a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, SMEFT must also be Poincare invariant. The SMEFT Lagrangian is explicitly constructed with operators that obey Poincare symmetry.\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model, for instance, in the interactions described by the CKM matrix. SMEFT is designed to parameterize both the Standard Model's CP violation and potential new sources of CP violation from physics at higher energy scales. Consequently, the framework explicitly includes numerous CP-violating operators, and it is not a required symmetry.\n4.  **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be symmetric under the combined transformation of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, all of its operators must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
