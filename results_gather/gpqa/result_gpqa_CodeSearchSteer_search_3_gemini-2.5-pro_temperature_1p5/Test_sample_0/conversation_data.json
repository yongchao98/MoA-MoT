    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the energy uncertainty, or \"width,\" of each level. This energy width (ΔE) is fundamentally linked to the lifetime (τ or Δt) of the quantum state by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle can be expressed as: ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). A shorter lifetime leads to a greater uncertainty or spread in the energy of the state. This energy spread is often referred to as the natural linewidth of the state.\n\nWe can calculate the energy width for each of the two quantum states:\n\n1.  **For the first state (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s):**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **For the second state (τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s):**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them must be larger than the broader of the two linewidths. In this case, the broader linewidth is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than both energy widths.\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than the larger energy width (ΔE₁).\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is significantly larger than both ΔE₁ and ΔE₂.\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than both energy widths.\n\nThe only energy difference that is substantially greater than the natural linewidths of both states is 10⁻⁴ eV, which would allow them to be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<C>>>"
