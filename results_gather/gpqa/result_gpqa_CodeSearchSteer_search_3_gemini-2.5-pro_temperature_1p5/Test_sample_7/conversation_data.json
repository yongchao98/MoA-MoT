  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of Single Mutants\nFirst, let's look at the effect of each individual gene knock-out on anthracnose resistance compared to the 100% resistance of the wild-type control:\n*   **g1 mutant (G1 knock-out):** 75% resistance. This is a partial loss of resistance, indicating G1 contributes to the plant's defense, but it is not the most critical component.\n*   **g2 mutant (G2 knock-out):** 0% resistance. This complete loss of resistance signifies that G2 is an essential gene for this trait. The pathway for resistance cannot function without it.\n*   **g3 mutant (G3 knock-out):** 50% resistance. This is a substantial loss, greater than that of g1, suggesting G3 has a more significant role in the resistance pathway than G1.\n\n### Analysis of Double Mutants and Gene Interactions\nNow, we analyze the double mutants to understand how the genes interact. This is where concepts like epistasis and redundancy become important.\n*   **Epistasis** occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation masks the effect of another. The phenotype of the double mutant will resemble one of the single mutants.\n*   **Synergy/Redundancy:** A synergistic interaction occurs when the combined effect of two mutations is greater than the sum of their individual effects. This often points to the genes functioning in parallel pathways or having redundant (overlapping) functions.\n\nLet's examine the double-mutant phenotypes:\n*   **g1g2 (0% resistance):** The phenotype of this double mutant is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance). The complete loss of function from the `g2` mutation masks the partial loss from the `g1` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n*   **g2g3 (0% resistance):** Similarly, the phenotype of the `g2g3` double mutant is the same as the `g2` single mutant. This means **G2 is also epistatic to G3**.\n*   **g1g3 (10% resistance):** The phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant is much more severe than either the `g1` (75%) or `g3` (50%) single mutants. This is not epistasis, but a **synergistic interaction**. The combined loss of G1 and G3 almost completely abolishes resistance (a 90% drop from the control), which is a much greater effect than the sum of their individual effects might suggest. This strong synergistic effect indicates that G1 and G3 likely function in parallel pathways that contribute to the same outcome (resistance) or have partially overlapping, and therefore redundant, functions.\n\n### Drawing Conclusions\n1.  **Role of G2:** Since the `g2` mutation is epistatic to both `g1` and `g3` and results in a total loss of resistance, G2 holds the most critical position. Given that we know one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, G2 is the prime candidate. A master transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3 (and potentially other defense genes) would explain why knocking it out has such a drastic and masking effect.\n\n2.  **Interaction of G1 and G3:** The severe phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant points to a synergistic relationship, best described as G1 and G3 having redundant functions. They likely represent two parallel branches of the defense response, both activated by G2. When only one is knocked out, the other can partially compensate, but when both are knocked out, the pathway almost completely fails.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor and accurately describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. The final claim, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\", is incorrect based on the data, as their double mutant has a novel, more severe phenotype. However, the first two points are the strongest and most accurate conclusions from the experiment.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** While they may have similar promoters if activated by the same transcription factor (G2), this is an inference not directly proven by the experiment. It incorrectly claims G3 is epistatic to G1.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** Pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be determined from this experiment, which only measures one trait. It also incorrectly claims G1 is epistatic to G3.\n*   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** It incorrectly identifies G1 as the transcription factor. While \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\" is correct, the first premise is wrong, making the whole option incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** Option A contains the two most accurate conclusions derived from the experimental data. The synergistic interaction observed between G1 and G3 is best described as gene redundancy, and G2's epistatic relationship over both G1 and G3 makes it the logical choice for the upstream transcription factor. Despite the inaccuracy of the final clause, this option is the best fit.\n\n<<<A>>>"
