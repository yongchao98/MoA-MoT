    "To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics for binary stars. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, where the radial velocity variations of both stars are observed, the total mass of the system (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M_total = M₁ + M₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂).\n\nThe formula for the total mass is:\nM₁ + M₂ = [P / (2πG)] * [(K₁ + K₂)³ / sin³(i)]\n\nWhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **K₁ and K₂** are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for each star.\n*   **i** is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. For eclipses to occur, the orbital inclination `i` must be very close to 90 degrees. When `i` is 90 degrees, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin³(i) = 1. This greatly simplifies the mass calculation. We can assume this is the case for both eclipsing systems.\n\nThis means that the total mass (M_total) is directly proportional to the period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nNow we can calculate this value for each system and then find their ratio.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   M₁ ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   M₂ ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\n**Ratio of the masses:**\nTo find out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we calculate the ratio M₁ / M₂:\n\nRatio = M₁ / M₂ = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
