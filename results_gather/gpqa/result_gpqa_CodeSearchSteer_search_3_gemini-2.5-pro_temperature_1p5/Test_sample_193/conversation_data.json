    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2^3 = 8 possible microstates.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the equation:\nE = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\nWe will now calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible configurations:\n\n**Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n*   **State 1: (+1, +1, +1)**\n    *   E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n*   **State 2: (-1, -1, -1)**\n    *   E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nThere are two states with an energy level of -3J. The degeneracy for this energy level is 2.\n\n**Case 2: Two spins are aligned one way, and the third is aligned the other way.**\n*   **States with two spins +1 and one spin -1:**\n    *   **(a) (+1, +1, -1):** E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   **(b) (+1, -1, +1):** E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   **(c) (-1, +1, +1):** E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **States with one spin +1 and two spins -1:**\n    *   **(d) (+1, -1, -1):** E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   **(e) (-1, +1, -1):** E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   **(f) (-1, -1, +1):** E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\nThere are six states that have an energy level of J. The degeneracy for this energy level is 6.\n\nThe partition function, Z, is the sum over all states:\nZ = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i)\nwhere g_i is the degeneracy of the energy level E_i.\n\nSubstituting the energies and their degeneracies we found:\n*   For E = -3J, the degeneracy is 2. The contribution to Z is 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ).\n*   For E = J, the degeneracy is 6. The contribution to Z is 6 * e^(-β(J)) = 6e^(-Jβ).\n\nSumming these contributions gives the total partition function:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
