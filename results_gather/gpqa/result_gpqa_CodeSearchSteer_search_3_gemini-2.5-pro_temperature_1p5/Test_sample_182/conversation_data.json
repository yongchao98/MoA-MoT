    "The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of a molecule, also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the total number of rings and π (pi) bonds present. It is a valuable tool for deducing the structure of an organic compound from its molecular formula.\n\n**1. Determine the Structure and Formula of the Reactant**\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. This contributes one ring and one double bond to the IHD.\n*   **-carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group, located at position 1. This group contains a C=O double bond.\n*   **-formyl:** A -CHO group (an aldehyde), located at position 2. This group also contains a C=O double bond.\n*   **-vinyl:** A -CH=CH₂ group, located at position 5. This group contains a C=C double bond.\n\nBy tallying the atoms, the molecular formula of the reactant is determined to be C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe IHD of the reactant can be calculated in two ways:\n*   **From the structure:** 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in carboxylic acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n*   **From the formula (IHD = C - H/2 + 1, ignoring oxygen atoms):** IHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and the Product**\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to completely reduce several functional groups to their corresponding alkanes:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Alkenes (C=C double bonds) are reduced to alkanes (C-C single bonds).\n\nApplying this to our reactant:\n*   The carboxylic acid at C1 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at C2 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring is saturated.\n*   The vinyl group at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a saturated cycloalkane with ten carbon atoms: 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. The carbon skeleton remains intact, but all double bonds and oxygen atoms are removed.\n\n**3. Determine the Molecular Formula and IHD of the Product**\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane. A saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) with 'n' carbon atoms has the general molecular formula CₙH₂ₙ. Since our product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the product can now be calculated using its molecular formula, C₁₀H₂₀.\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nThis IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane skeleton. All other forms of unsaturation (the double bonds) have been removed by the reaction.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
