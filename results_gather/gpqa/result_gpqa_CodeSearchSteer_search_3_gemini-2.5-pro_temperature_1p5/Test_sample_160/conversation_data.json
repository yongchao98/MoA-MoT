    "The scenario describes two different mean free paths within the same gas environment:\n\n*   **λ1:** The mean free path of the gas molecules themselves, determined by collisions between the molecules.\n*   **λ2:** The mean free path of high-energy electrons from the microscope's beam, determined by scattering interactions with the gas molecules.\n\nThe key to understanding the relationship between λ1 and λ2 lies in the concept of the collision cross-section (σ), which represents the effective area a particle presents for a collision to occur. The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to this cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ).\n\n1.  **Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules (λ1):** This is determined by the kinetic cross-section of the gas molecules colliding with each other. This cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules (on the order of angstroms). Two molecules of a certain size are relatively likely to collide with one another.\n\n2.  **Mean Free Path of Electrons (λ2):** This is determined by the scattering cross-section between a high-energy electron and a gas molecule. The electron is a point-like particle, vastly smaller than a gas molecule. It interacts with the gas molecule's electromagnetic field (the atomic nucleus and its surrounding electron cloud). For a very high-energy electron (1000 kV), the probability of a significant scattering event is much lower than the probability of two large gas molecules colliding. In essence, the tiny, fast-moving electron \"sees\" a much smaller target in the gas molecule than another gas molecule does.\n\nBecause the collision cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule (σ_electron-gas) is significantly smaller than the kinetic cross-section for a gas molecule with another gas molecule (σ_gas-gas), the resulting mean free path for the electron (λ2) will be significantly longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n\nTherefore, λ2 will be substantially greater than λ1. Reviewing the given options, the only one that correctly reflects this physical reality is that λ2 is larger than λ1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
