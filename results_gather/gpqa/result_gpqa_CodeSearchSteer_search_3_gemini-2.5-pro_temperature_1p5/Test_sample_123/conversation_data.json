    "The problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay. To determine the required Lorentz factor, we can set up a ratio based on the formula for particle survival probability.\n\n### The Physics of Particle Decay\n\nThe survival probability P of an unstable particle after a time *t* in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law. This law must account for time dilation, a relativistic effect where time for a moving particle passes slower than for a stationary observer. The particle's lifetime in the lab frame (*t_lab*) is its proper lifetime (*τ*, the lifetime in its own rest frame) multiplied by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\nThe formula for the fraction of particles remaining (N/N₀) after traveling a distance *R* at a velocity *v* is:\n\n**N/N₀ = e<sup>(-t / (γτ))</sup>**\n\nSince the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity *v* is approximately the speed of light, *c*. Therefore, the time of flight *t* to the detector wall is *R/c*. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n\n**N/N₀ = e<sup>(-R / (γcτ))</sup>**\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\nWe are presented with two scenarios:\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** A fraction of 1/3 of the particles reaches the detector.\n    *   N/N₀ = 1/3\n    *   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n    *   Radius, R = 30 m\n\n*   **Scenario 2:** A fraction of 2/3 of the particles reaches the detector.\n    *   N/N₀ = 2/3\n    *   Lorentz factor, γ₂ = ?\n    *   Radius, R = 30 m\n\nBy setting up equations for both scenarios, we can find the unknown Lorentz factor, γ₂.\n\n1.  **For Scenario 1:**\n    1/3 = e<sup>(-30 / (20 * cτ))</sup>\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\n    ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)\n\n2.  **For Scenario 2:**\n    2/3 = e<sup>(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))</sup>\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n    ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\n3.  **Solving for the new Lorentz factor (γ₂):**\n    We can create a ratio of the two equations to eliminate the unknown proper lifetime (τ):\n\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 / cτ) / (30 / (γ₂ * cτ))\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 * γ₂ * cτ) / (30 * cτ)\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 * γ₂) / 30\n    γ₂ = (30 / 1.5) * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))\n    γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2)))\n\n    Using the approximate values ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931))\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\n    γ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
