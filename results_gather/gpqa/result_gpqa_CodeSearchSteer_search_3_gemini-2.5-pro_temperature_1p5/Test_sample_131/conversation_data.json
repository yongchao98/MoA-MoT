    "To determine the correct pair of compounds, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each substance and see which 1:1 mixture matches the provided spectral data.\n\n**Given Spectral Data:**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio around 6.7 ppm.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio around 2.2 ppm.\n*   All compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound's Expected 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing a single sharp peak in the aliphatic region. This singlet integrates to 12 protons.\n    *   The two aromatic protons are also equivalent, resulting in one singlet in the aromatic region, integrating to 2 protons.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at positions 1 and 3 are equivalent (6H), the one at position 2 is unique (3H), and the one at position 5 is unique (3H). This results in three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent, producing one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H; ratio 2:1:1).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at positions 1 and 4 (6H) and the pair at positions 2 and 3 (6H). This gives two aliphatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The two aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent, giving one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H; ratio 1:1).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The aliphatic portion consists of ethyl groups. These will not produce singlets but rather a quartet for the -CH2- protons and a triplet for the -CH3- protons due to spin-spin splitting. This immediately eliminates any option containing this compound.\n\n**Evaluating the 1:1 Mixture Options:**\n\nThe mixture contains two compounds, and in a 1:1 molar ratio, the total number of protons from each compound is equal. All tetramethylbenzene isomers have 14 protons (2 aromatic, 12 aliphatic).\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** The mixture shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This is consistent with mixing any two of the tetramethylbenzene isomers, as each contributes one aromatic singlet of 2H intensity.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:** The key to the solution lies here. The mixture has three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons means the signals integrate to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's examine the options based on the aliphatic signals they would produce in a mixture:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would have signals from a 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) and three separate signals of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This results in four aliphatic signals, which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would exhibit signals of 6H, 6H (from 1,2,3,4-TMB) and 6H, 3H, 3H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB). Even with a potential overlap of the 6H signals, the resulting pattern (e.g., 12H, 6H, 3H, 3H) does not match the required 12H, 6H, 6H integration.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides **one aliphatic singlet of 12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides **two aliphatic singlets, each of 6H**.\n    *   When combined, these produce exactly three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\nTherefore, the mixture consists of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
