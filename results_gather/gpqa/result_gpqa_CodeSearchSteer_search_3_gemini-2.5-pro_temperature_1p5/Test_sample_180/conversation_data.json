    "To determine the approximate ratio of neutrino fluxes, we must first understand which solar fusion reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy bands and how the hypothetical cessation of the pp-III branch affects these fluxes.\n\n### Neutrino Sources and Energy Bands\n\n1.  **Neutrino-Producing Reactions:**\n    *   **pp-I Branch:** The primary `p + p → d + e⁺ + νe` reaction produces a high flux of low-energy neutrinos up to 420 keV.\n    *   **pp-II Branch:** The electron capture by Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νe`) produces monoenergetic neutrinos, with the most prominent line at **861 keV** (a smaller line is at 384 keV).\n    *   **pp-III Branch:** The beta decay of Boron-8 (`⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νe`) produces a continuous spectrum of high-energy neutrinos, up to about 15 MeV.\n    *   **CNO Cycle:** This cycle, which accounts for about 1% of the Sun's energy, produces neutrinos from the decays of ¹³N and ¹⁵O, with energies extending up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Energy Bands:**\n    *   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):** Neutrinos in this range come from the continuous spectra of the **⁸B** decay (part of pp-III) and the **CNO cycle**.\n    *   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):** Neutrinos in this range have three sources: the continuous spectrum of **⁸B** decay (pp-III), the very strong monoenergetic line from **⁷Be** decay at 861 keV (pp-II), and the continuous spectrum of the **CNO cycle**.\n\n### Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch\n\nThe hypothetical scenario states that the pp-III branch stops. The key reaction in this branch is the one that produces Boron-8 (⁸B), which subsequently decays and releases a high-energy neutrino. Therefore, stopping the pp-III branch effectively **eliminates the entire flux of ⁸B neutrinos**. All other reactions, including the pp-II branch and the CNO cycle, continue as normal.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio After the Change\n\nWith the ⁸B neutrino flux gone, let's re-evaluate the sources in each band:\n\n*   **Flux (Band 1: 700-800 keV):** The only remaining significant source of neutrinos in this energy window is the **CNO cycle**.\n*   **Flux (Band 2: 800-900 keV):** This band still contains the powerful, sharp neutrino line from **⁷Be decay at 861 keV**, which belongs to the pp-II branch. There is also a contribution from the CNO cycle.\n\nThe crux of the question is now to compare the CNO neutrino flux in the first band to the ⁷Be neutrino flux in the second band.\n\n*   The total flux of neutrinos from the CNO cycle is estimated to be around 7.0 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹. This flux is spread over a wide energy range (up to 1.73 MeV), so the portion falling within the 700-800 keV window is a fraction of this total.\n*   The total flux of the 861 keV ⁷Be neutrino line is significantly higher, on the order of 4 to 5 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹. This entire line flux is concentrated within the 800-900 keV band.\n*   Comparing the magnitudes, the flux in the second band (dominated by ⁷Be neutrinos) is roughly an order of magnitude larger than the *total* CNO flux. Since the first band only receives a *fraction* of the CNO flux, the denominator of our ratio will be substantially larger than the numerator.\n\nLet's make an estimation:\n\n*   Flux(Band 2) is dominated by the ⁷Be line: ~4.5 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹.\n*   Flux(Band 1) contains only a fraction of the total CNO flux. The total CNO flux (~7 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹) is spread out over roughly 1.7 MeV. A 100 keV slice (like our 700-800 keV band) would contain a small fraction of this, likely less than 1 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹.\n*   Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2) ≈ (small fraction of 7x10⁸) / (4.5x10⁹)\n\nThis calculation shows the numerator is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the denominator.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of Flux (700-800 KeV) / Flux (800-900 keV) is approximately **0.01**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
