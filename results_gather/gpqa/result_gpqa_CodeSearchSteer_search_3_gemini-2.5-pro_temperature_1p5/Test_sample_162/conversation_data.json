    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct answer.\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.**\nFirst, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\nMolar Mass = (Atomic Mass of Fe) + 3 * (Atomic Mass of O + Atomic Mass of H)\nUsing the values Fe ≈ 55.85 g/mol, O ≈ 16.00 g/mol, and H ≈ 1.01 g/mol:\nMolar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\nNow, we calculate the moles of 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃:\nMoles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the moles of acid required for the neutralization reaction.**\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) is a neutralization reaction.\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\nMoles of H⁺ consumed = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**3. Analyze the options based on the required amount of acid.**\nThe problem states that a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid is used. We can calculate the volume of this acid needed just to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃. This represents the minimum volume of acid required before considering the excess needed to maintain the final pH.\nVolume of acid for reaction = Moles of H⁺ consumed / Acid concentration\nVolume = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L\nConverting to cm³, Volume = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis means that a volume of at least 28.07 cm³ of the acid is required to completely react with all the Fe(OH)₃. Any volume less than this will not be sufficient to dissolve the solid. Let's examine the options:\n*   A) 28.05 cm³ (less than 28.07 cm³, insufficient)\n*   B) 32.14 cm³ (sufficient)\n*   C) 20.40 cm³ (less than 28.07 cm³, insufficient)\n*   D) 30.09 cm³ (sufficient)\n\nWe can immediately eliminate options A and C.\n\n**4. Verify the consistency of the remaining options (B and D).**\nNow we must check if the given pH in the remaining options is consistent with the provided volume of acid. The total volume of the final solution is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n\n**Checking Option D (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³):**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ added:** Volume * Concentration = (30.09 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) * 0.1 mol/L = 0.003009 mol.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ remaining in solution (excess):** Moles added - Moles consumed = 0.003009 mol - 0.002807 mol = 0.000202 mol.\n*   **Concentration of H⁺ in the final solution:** [H⁺] = Moles remaining / Total volume = 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\n*   **Calculate the pH:** pH = -log([H⁺]) = -log(0.00202) ≈ 2.694.\nThis calculated pH (2.694) matches the pH given in option D (2.69).\n\n**Checking Option B (pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³):**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ added:** Volume * Concentration = (32.14 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) * 0.1 mol/L = 0.003214 mol.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ remaining in solution (excess):** Moles added - Moles consumed = 0.003214 mol - 0.002807 mol = 0.000407 mol.\n*   **Concentration of H⁺ in the final solution:** [H⁺] = Moles remaining / Total volume = 0.000407 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00407 M.\n*   **Calculate the pH:** pH = -log([H⁺]) = -log(0.00407) ≈ 2.39.\nThis calculated pH (2.39) does **not** match the pH given in option B (3.16).\n\nTherefore, option D is the only one where the volume of acid and the resulting pH are consistent with each other. The condition for dissolution (related to the solubility product constant, Ksp) is also met with the pH of 2.69, as this level of acidity is sufficient to keep the resulting iron ions in solution.\n\n<<<D>>>"
