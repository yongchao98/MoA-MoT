    "### Breakdown of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This name describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring between carbons C1 and C6. There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4 with the specified R/S configurations.\n    *   **Reagent**: The reagent is Me2CuLi, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, also known as a Gilman reagent. These reagents are a source of soft nucleophiles, in this case, a methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Key Principles**: The problem provides two crucial rules for the reaction of organocuprates with saturated epoxides, which are well-established in organic chemistry:\n    *   **Regioselectivity**: The incoming nucleophile (the methyl group from the cuprate) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide ring. This occurs because organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and the reaction proceeds via an SN2-like mechanism.\n    *   **Stereochemistry**: The attack occurs with an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom where the nucleophile is added. This is a hallmark of the SN2 reaction mechanism.\n\n3.  **Applying the Principles to the Specific Molecule**:\n    *   **Identifying the point of attack**: The epoxide ring is formed by C1 and C6 of the bicycloheptane system.\n        *   Carbon C1 is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group.\n        *   Carbon C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n        *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and it will be attacked by the methyl nucleophile from the Gilman reagent.\n    *   **Determining the stereochemical outcome**: The attack on C6 proceeds via an SN2 mechanism.\n        *   The initial configuration at C6 is given as (S).\n        *   An SN2 reaction causes an inversion of stereochemistry.\n        *   Therefore, the configuration at the carbon atom that was C6 will become (R) in the product.\n    *   **Predicting the product's structure**:\n        *   The methyl group attacks C6, and the C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after an aqueous workup, becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   A new methyl group is now attached to the former C6.\n        *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not involved in the reaction and thus retain their original configurations.\n\n4.  **Naming the Final Product**:\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol derivative. According to IUPAC nomenclature rules for alcohols, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1.\n    *   **Mapping from old numbering to new**:\n        *   Old **C1** (with an R configuration, a methyl group, and the new -OH group) becomes the new **C1**. Its configuration remains (R).\n        *   Old **C6** (with an S configuration, attacked by Me⁻) becomes the new **C2**. Its configuration inverts to (R).\n        *   Old **C4** (with an R configuration and a methyl group) becomes the new **C4**. Its configuration remains (R).\n        *   Old **C3** (with an R configuration and a methyl group) becomes the new **C5**. Its configuration remains (R).\n    *   The resulting product has methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5, making it a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n    *   The stereochemical descriptors are (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n    Combining the name and stereochemistry, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
