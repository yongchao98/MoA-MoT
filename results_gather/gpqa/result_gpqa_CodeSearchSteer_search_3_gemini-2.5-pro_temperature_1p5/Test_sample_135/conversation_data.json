    "The problem asks for the evaluation of the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∇.f`, within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nThe vector field `f(r)` is defined as having a magnitude of `1/r^2` and being directed radially outwards. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n\nwhere `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence `∇.f` in spherical coordinates yields zero for all `r > 0`. However, the vector field is undefined at the origin (`r = 0`), creating a singularity. This situation is a classic application of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem).\n\nThe Divergence Theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` to the surface integral of the field's flux through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, the volume `V` is the sphere of radius `R`, and the surface `S` is the surface of that sphere.\n\nTo solve the integral, we can calculate the flux of the vector field through the surface of the sphere:\n\n1.  **The vector field on the surface:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the field `f` on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n2.  **The surface element:** For a sphere, the differential surface element `dS` is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂`, where the direction is also radially outward.\n3.  **The dot product:** The dot product `f ⋅ dS` is `((1/R^2) * r̂) ⋅ (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂)`. Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, and the `R^2` terms cancel out, this simplifies to `sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n4.  **The surface integral:** We need to integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the azimuthal angle `φ` are from 0 to `2π`, and for the polar angle `θ` are from 0 to `π`.\n\n`Flux = ∫ (from φ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   The integral of `dφ` from 0 to `2π` is `2π`.\n*   The integral of `sin(θ)` from 0 to `π` is `[-cos(θ)]` from 0 to `π`, which evaluates to `(-cos(π)) - (-cos(0)) = (-(-1)) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\nMultiplying these results gives the total flux:\n\n`Flux = (2) * (2π) = 4π`\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, this flux is equal to the volume integral of the divergence. The non-zero result, despite the divergence being zero almost everywhere, is due to the singularity at the origin, which acts as a source. In fact, the divergence of this specific vector field is mathematically described by the Dirac delta function: `∇ · (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ^3(r)`. The integral of this over any volume containing the origin is `4π`.\n\nThus, the value of the integral is `4π`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
