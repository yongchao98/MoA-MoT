    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-).\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of each substance:**\n\n*   **KH2PO4:** This compound provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-).\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol of H2PO4-\n*   **Na2HPO4●2H2O:** This compound provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-).\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol of HPO4^2-\n\n**2. Calculate the initial molar concentrations:**\n\nThe total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n\n*   **Concentration of H2PO4- ([Acid]):**\n    *   [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **Concentration of HPO4^2- ([Base]):**\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration ([H+]):**\n\nThe solution is a buffer composed of the weak acid H2PO4- and its conjugate base HPO4^2-. This buffer's pH is governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid (Ka2).\n\n*   The equilibrium is: H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\n*   The equilibrium expression is: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n\n*   [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n*   [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (1.308)\n*   [H+] = 8.11x10^-8 M\n\n**4. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration ([PO4^3-]):**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-), which is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka3.\n\n*   The equilibrium is: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\n*   The equilibrium expression is: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the orthophosphate concentration [PO4^3-]:\n\n*   [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n\nNow, substitute the known values:\n\n*   [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10^-8 M)\n*   [PO4^3-] = 6.23x10^-7 M\n\nThis value rounds to 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\n<<<B>>>"
