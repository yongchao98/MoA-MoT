    "To determine the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx, we first need to define the quantum state and the operators in matrix form.\n\nThe spin-up and spin-down states are represented by the vectors:\n*   `|↑⟩` = `[1, 0]`ᵀ\n*   `|↓⟩` = `[0, 1]`ᵀ\n\nThe given linear superposition is `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`. In vector form, this is:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [1, 0]`ᵀ `+ (√3)/2 * [0, 1]`ᵀ `= [0.5, (√3)/2]`ᵀ\n\nThe Pauli matrices σz and σx are:\n*   `σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n*   `σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe operator for which we want to find the expectation value is `A = 10σz + 5σx`.\n\nThe expectation value `⟨A⟩` for a state `|ψ⟩` is calculated using the formula `⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩`. The term `⟨ψ|` represents the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩`, which is `[0.5, (√3)/2]`.\n\nWe can use the linearity of expectation values to simplify the calculation: `⟨A⟩ = ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩`.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expectation value of `σz`:\n`⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩`\nThe operation `σz|ψ⟩` yields `(0.5)|↑⟩ - (√3/2)|↓⟩`.\nSo, `⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)² - (√3/2)² = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`.\n\nNext, we calculate the expectation value of `σx`:\n`⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩`\nThe operation `σx|ψ⟩` yields `(√3/2)|↑⟩ + (0.5)|↓⟩`.\nSo, `⟨σx⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2`.\n\nNow, we combine these results to find the total expectation value:\n`⟨A⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n`⟨A⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3`\n\nUsing the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732`\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
