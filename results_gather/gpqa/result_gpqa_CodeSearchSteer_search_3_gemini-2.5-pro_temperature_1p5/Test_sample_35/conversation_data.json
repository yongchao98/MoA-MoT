    "The observation pertains to the 21-cm hyperfine transition line of neutral atomic hydrogen. The discrepancy between the observed energy of 3.9 µeV and the known rest-frame energy of this transition is due to the cosmological redshift of the source, located 2.1 Gpc away. In its rest frame, such as within the Milky Way, this transition has a wavelength of 21 cm and an energy of approximately 5.9 µeV.\n\nThis 21-cm line originates from the spin-flip transition in the ground state of neutral hydrogen atoms (H I). Within the interstellar medium (ISM), this line can be observed in both emission and absorption, which helps distinguish between different phases of the gas.\n\nThe interstellar medium is composed of several phases with different temperatures and densities:\n*   **Cold Neutral Medium (CNM):** Composed of neutral atomic hydrogen with temperatures between 50-100 K.\n*   **Warm Neutral Medium (WNM):** Also composed of neutral atomic hydrogen but at higher temperatures of 6000-10000 K.\n*   **Molecular Medium:** Where hydrogen exists as H₂ molecules in cold, dense clouds.\n*   **Ionized Medium:** Where hydrogen is ionized and therefore does not produce the 21-cm line.\n\nThe 21-cm line seen in absorption is a key tracer of the Cold Neutral Medium. The optical depth of the absorption line is inversely proportional to the gas temperature, meaning colder gas produces a stronger absorption signal. While the WNM does contribute to 21-cm emission, it is generally too warm and diffuse to create significant absorption. Therefore, an observation of this line in absorption specifically points to the presence of cold atomic hydrogen.\n\n<<<D>>>"
