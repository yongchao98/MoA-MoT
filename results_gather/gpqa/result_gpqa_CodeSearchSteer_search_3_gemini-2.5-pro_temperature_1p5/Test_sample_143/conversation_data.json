    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to perform a series of calculations involving its lifetime and relativistic properties.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Mean Lifetime (τ)\n\nThe mean lifetime (τ) of a particle is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ). The relationship is given by the formula τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nGiven:\n*   Decay width, Γ_X = 320 MeV\n*   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s\n\nCalculation:\nτ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n### 2. Calculation of Relativistic Factors (γ and β)\n\nDue to the high production energy, the particle travels at a relativistic speed. We need to calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) and the velocity relative to the speed of light (β).\n\nGiven:\n*   Production energy, E_X = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy:\nγ = E_X / m_X = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 20/3 ≈ 6.67\n\nThe factor β is calculated from γ:\nβ = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400) ≈ 0.9887\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Mean Decay Distance (d)\n\nIn the laboratory frame, the particle's lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor γ. Consequently, the mean distance it travels before decaying is also extended. The mean decay distance (d) is given by the formula d = γ * β * c * τ, where c is the speed of light.\n\nA more direct method uses the product ħc (reduced Planck constant times the speed of light), which has a value of approximately 197.3 MeV·fm (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m). The formula for the decay distance becomes:\nd = γ * β * (ħc / Γ)\n\nCalculation:\n*   γβ = (20/3) * (√391 / 20) = √391 / 3 ≈ 6.591\n*   ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm\n*   Γ = 320 MeV\n\nd ≈ (√391 / 3) * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\nd ≈ 6.591 * (0.6166 fm)\nd ≈ 4.0655 fm\n\nSince 1 femtometer (fm) is equal to 10⁻¹⁵ meters, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nB) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nC) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nD) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
