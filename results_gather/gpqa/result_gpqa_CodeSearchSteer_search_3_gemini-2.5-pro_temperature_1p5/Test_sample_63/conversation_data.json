    "The user wants me to solve a quantitative chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Information Distillation**\n*   **Reactants:** 7.20 g of an equimolar mixture of Salt A and Salt B.\n*   **Reaction:** Heated to 200°C, decomposing completely into gases.\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The gas mixture passed through Tube 1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂), whose weight increased by 3.60 g. This substance absorbs water.\n    *   Then through Tube 2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution), whose weight did not change. This indicates no acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ were absorbed.\n    *   Then through Tube 3 (red-hot copper), whose weight increased by 0.80 g due to CuO formation. This indicates the presence of oxygen.\n    *   The remaining gas, C, has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n*   **Goal:** Find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B combined.\n\n**2. Step-by-step Derivations**\n\n*   **Step 2a: Identify and quantify the products.**\n    *   **Tube 1:** The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of H₂O.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube 3:** The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen that reacted with Cu to form CuO.\n        *   The gas must be O₂. The mass increase is purely the mass of oxygen atoms.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since the gas is O₂, moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L at STP.\n        *   Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   **Tube 2:** The weight did not change. The gases entering it were the products from decomposition minus the water absorbed in Tube 1. The gas C that remains is inert to the whole system, and O₂ does not react with Ca(OH)₂. Therefore, gas C must be something inert like N₂, which is a common decomposition product. Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Verify product identification with the law of conservation of mass.**\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of N₂ produced = 0.1 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n    *   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the salt mixture perfectly. Our identification of the products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) is correct.\n\n*   **Step 2c: Determine the total elemental composition of the initial mixture.**\n    *   Moles of Hydrogen (H) = 0.2 mol H₂O * 2 H/H₂O = 0.4 mol H.\n    *   Moles of Nitrogen (N) = 0.1 mol N₂ * 2 N/N₂ = 0.2 mol N.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen (O) = (0.2 mol H₂O * 1 O/H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ * 2 O/O₂) = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n    *   The total moles of elements in the 7.20 g mixture are H: 0.4, N: 0.2, O: 0.25.\n    *   The ratio of atoms is H:N:O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25. To get integers, multiply by 20: H:N:O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n\n*   **Step 2d: Identify Salts A and B.**\n    *   The total empirical formula of the mixture is H₈N₄O₅.\n    *   Since the mixture is equimolar, this formula represents the sum of the atoms in one molecule of salt A and one molecule of salt B: Formula(A) + Formula(B) = H₈N₄O₅.\n    *   The elements are H, N, and O, suggesting ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n    *   H₈N₄O₅ contains eight hydrogen atoms, which corresponds perfectly to two ammonium cations (2 x NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n    *   The remaining part is N₂O₅. This can be split into two common anions: NO₃⁻ and NO₂⁻.\n    *   Let Salt A be ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Let Salt B be ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Let's check the sum: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅. This matches our derived formula.\n\n*   **Step 2e: Verify the decomposition reactions.**\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₂: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₃: At temperatures around 200°C, one possible decomposition pathway is 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). The problem conditions (presence of O₂ as a product) support this pathway over the more common decomposition to N₂O.\n    *   Let's assume there are `x` moles of each salt.\n        *   `x` mol NH₄NO₂ produces `x` mol N₂ and `2x` mol H₂O.\n        *   `x` mol NH₄NO₃ produces `x` mol N₂ + `0.5x` mol O₂ + `2x` mol H₂O (based on the stoichiometry above).\n    *   Total products: `2x` mol N₂, `4x` mol H₂O, and `0.5x` mol O₂.\n    *   We found n(N₂) = 0.1 mol, n(H₂O) = 0.2 mol, and n(O₂) = 0.025 mol.\n    *   Let's check the ratios:\n        *   n(H₂O) / n(O₂) = 0.2 / 0.025 = 8. Theoretical ratio = `4x` / `0.5x` = 8. (Matches)\n        *   n(N₂) / n(O₂) = 0.1 / 0.025 = 4. Theoretical ratio = `2x` / `0.5x` = 4. (Matches)\n    *   The proposed identities of the salts and their decomposition reactions are consistent with all the data.\n\n*   **Step 2f: Calculate the final answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nFinal check of all steps. The logic is consistent and all provided data points have been used and accounted for. The identification of products from the experimental setup is standard chemical knowledge. The deduction of the reactants from the products is a logical stoichiometric calculation. The final step is a simple counting of atoms based on the derived formulas.\n\nBased on the detailed step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, the correct answer is 17. This corresponds to option B.The detailed stoichiometric analysis has led to the identification of salts A and B as ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂), respectively.\n\nThe number of atoms in each salt is calculated as follows:\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms, for a total of 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms, for a total of 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit.\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis detailed calculation, which is consistent with all the experimental data provided in the problem statement, confirms the result.\n\n<<<B>>>"
