    "A molecule will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally occurs in molecules that lack a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Here's an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule lacks a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). Therefore, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The nomenclature (3aR, 7aS) indicates the presence of specific stereocenters. Naming a compound with R/S designations signifies that it is a single, chiral enantiomer, which by definition is optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry due to the (R,S) configuration and the identical substituents on both ends (carboxylic acid groups). This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. The (2R,3R) configuration means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image (the 2S,3S enantiomer). As a specific enantiomer, it is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon at position 1 is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH=CH-, and -CH2-CH2-), making it a chiral center. The (R) designation specifies that it is a single enantiomer, which is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound, also known as *cis*-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has multiple planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one hydroxylated carbon and the CH2 group opposite to it. The presence of these symmetry planes makes the molecule achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An examination of this molecule's structure reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. The carbon in the butyl chain at position 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the compounds that are optically active:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
