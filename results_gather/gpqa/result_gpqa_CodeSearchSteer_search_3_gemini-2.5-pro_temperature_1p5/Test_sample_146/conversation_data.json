    "To solve this problem, we will use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\n\nThe process is the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles ($2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$).\n\n*   **Initial State:** A proton and a slowly moving antiproton. Since the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" its kinetic energy is negligible. Therefore, the total initial energy is approximately the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   **Final State:** Four particles ($A^+, A^+, A^-, A^-$). These particles will be moving at high velocity.\n\nThe energy conservation equation is:\n\n*Total Initial Energy = Total Final Energy*\n\n$E_{p} + E_{\\bar{p}} = E_{A^+} + E_{A^+} + E_{A^-} + E_{A^-}$\n\nThe rest energy of a particle is given by Einstein's equation, $E = mc^2$. The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV. The antiproton has the same mass as the proton, so its rest energy is also 938 MeV.\n\n*   Initial Energy $\\approx (m_p c^2) + (m_{\\bar{p}} c^2) = 938 \\, \\text{MeV} + 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\nThe particles $A^+$ and $A^-$ have the same mass, with a rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$. The total energy of a single moving particle A is its relativistic energy, $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n*   Final Energy = $4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2) = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\, \\text{MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\nEquating the initial and final energies:\n\n$1876 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n### 2. Momentum Conservation\n\nThe initial momentum of the system is considered to be zero since the antiproton is moving slowly. For the total momentum to remain zero after the annihilation, the four resulting A particles must be emitted in such a way that their vector momenta sum to zero. Due to the symmetry of the products, the magnitude of the velocity will be the same for all four particles.\n\n### 3. Calculation of Velocity\n\nNow, we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\nNext, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.409} = \\sqrt{0.591}$\n\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.77c\nB) 0.96c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.86c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
