    "The problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a nearby grounded conducting sphere. This can be solved using the method of image charges.\n\n1.  **Method of Image Charges**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with a fictitious \"image\" charge, `q'`. This image charge is placed at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center to the charge `q`. The values for the image charge and its position are:\n    *   Image charge: `q' = -(R/d)q`\n    *   Image position: `b = R²/d`\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` at any point during this process is due to the attraction from the induced charges on the sphere's surface. This force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Integrating the Force**: The work `W` done *by the field* to bring the charge from infinity to distance `d` is `W = ∫ F⋅dr`. The potential energy `U` is `U = -W`. The force `F(x)` between the real charge `q` and its image `q'(x) = - (R/x)q` at a separation `x - b(x) = x - R²/x` is complex to integrate directly because the image charge's magnitude and position change as `q` moves.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using the Potential of the Image Charge**: A more direct method is to calculate the interaction energy of the final configuration. The potential energy of the charge `q` in the presence of the grounded sphere is equal to *half* the interaction potential between the charge `q` and its image `q'`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge (and thus the image charge) does not exist independently; its energy is already accounted for in the field of the primary charge `q`.\n\n    The potential energy `U` is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`, where `V_image` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The potential `V_image` at distance `d` from the center, created by `q'` at position `b`, is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n    Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [k * (-(R/d)q) / (d - R²/d)]`\n\n    Simplify the denominator:\n    `d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n\n    Substitute this back into the energy equation:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [k * (-(R/d)q) / ((d² - R²)/d)]`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [k * (-Rq/d) * (d/(d² - R²))]`\n\n    Cancel the `d` terms:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [k * (-Rq) / (d² - R²)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    B) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n    C) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    D) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n\nThe derived formula matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
