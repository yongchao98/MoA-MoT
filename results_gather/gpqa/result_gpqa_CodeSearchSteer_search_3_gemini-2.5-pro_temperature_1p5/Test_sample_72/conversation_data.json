    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n### 1. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let the velocity of the first astronaut be `v1 = 0.6c` and the velocity of the second astronaut be `v2 = 0.5c`.\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity `v_rel` of the second astronaut with respect to the first is:\n\n`v_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n`v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = -0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = -0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ -0.1428c`\n\nThe magnitude of the relative speed is approximately `0.14c`. The negative sign indicates that the second astronaut is moving towards the first astronaut from the first astronaut's reference frame.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Energy (E_total)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`. The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, v1 = 0.6c):**\n\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Next, calculate the energy (E1):\n    `E1 = γ1 * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2mc² = 2.5mc²`\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, v2 = 0.5c):**\n\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 = 1.1547`\n*   Next, calculate the energy (E2):\n    `E2 = γ2 * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc² ≈ 3.464mc²`\n\n**Total Energy of the System:**\n\n*   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n*   `E_total = 2.5mc² + 3.464mc²`\n*   `E_total = 5.964mc²`\n\n### 3. Compare with the Options\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   `E_total ≈ 5.96mc²`\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n*   B) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n*   C) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n*   D) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
