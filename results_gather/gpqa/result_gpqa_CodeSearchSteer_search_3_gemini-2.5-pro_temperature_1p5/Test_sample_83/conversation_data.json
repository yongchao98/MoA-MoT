    "The process of solving higher-dimensional heat equations often involves a semi-discretization in space, which transforms the partial differential equation (PDE) into a large system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form `dU/dt = AU + v(t)`. The solution to this system involves the matrix exponential function, `exp(A)`. For computational purposes, `exp(A)` is often replaced by a rational or fractional approximation, `R(A)`.\n\nThe key to converting the sequential calculation of `R(A)` into a parallel one lies in the mathematical properties of this fractional approximation. Specifically, the ability to decompose the rational function into a sum of simpler terms using a partial fraction expansion is the critical step.\n\nIf the fractional approximation `R(z)` has distinct poles (real or complex), it can be expressed as a sum of linear partial fractions. Applying this to the matrix `A`, the computation of `R(A)v` is broken down into a sum of independent terms. Each term requires solving a linear system of the form `(A - d*I)x = b`, where `d` is a pole of the rational function. These individual linear systems can be solved concurrently on different processors. The final solution is then obtained by summing the results from each processor. This \"divide and conquer\" strategy, enabled by the partial fraction decomposition, is the fundamental principle that transforms the inherently sequential problem into a parallel one.\n\nTherefore, the key factor is the decomposition into linear partial fractions.\n\n*   **B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions:** This typically complicates parallelization rather than enabling it. However, methods using partial fraction splitting have been successfully applied even in these cases.\n*   **C) Complex roots of fractional approximation:** The nature of the roots (real or complex) affects the arithmetic used (real vs. complex) but does not change the fundamental parallelization strategy, which relies on the decomposition itself.\n*   **D) Stability analysis:** This is a crucial requirement for any numerical algorithm to be valid and produce meaningful results, but it is not the mechanism that enables parallel computation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
