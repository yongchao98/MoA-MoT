    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituent groups attached.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms total:** A benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contribute a total of 2 carbons.\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl functional group.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly bonded to the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure:**\n    *   Based on the constraints, one substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain a carbonyl group and the remaining two carbon atoms. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Combining these parts, the molecule is a halo-acetophenone. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Substitution Pattern and its NMR Signature:**\n    *   The problem describes a di-substituted ring, which can be ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-). The ¹H NMR splitting pattern of the aromatic protons is highly dependent on this arrangement.\n    *   **Ortho-substitution** would result in four distinct and complex signals for the four aromatic protons.\n    *   **Meta-substitution** would also result in complex patterns, typically with four signals (or three if one proton is uniquely isolated).\n    *   **Para-substitution (1,4-)** is the most symmetrical. It creates two sets of chemically equivalent protons on the ring. This results in two signals, each integrating to 2 protons (2H), which appear as doublets due to coupling with their single adjacent proton. This \"two doublets, each 2H\" pattern is highly characteristic of para-substitution.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the ¹H NMR Data Options:**\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The signals at `7.8 ppm (2H, d)` and `7.6 ppm (2H, d)` are in the aromatic region and perfectly match the pattern for a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n        *   The acetyl group (-COCH₃) and the halogen are both electron-withdrawing, which shifts the aromatic protons downfield (greater than 7 ppm). The protons closer to the strongly withdrawing carbonyl group would be further downfield (around 7.8 ppm) than those closer to the halogen (around 7.6 ppm).\n        *   The signal at `2.3 ppm (3H, s)` corresponds to the three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) in the acetyl substituent. It is a singlet because it has no adjacent protons to couple with. Its chemical shift is typical for a methyl ketone.\n        *   This data is fully consistent with a 4'-haloacetophenone structure. For example, published data for 4'-chloroacetophenone shows peaks at δ 7.89 (d, 2H), 7.43 (d, 2H), and 2.59 (s, 3H), and data for 4'-bromoacetophenone shows peaks at δ 7.82 (d, 2H), 7.61 (d, 2H), and 2.57 (s, 3H). The values in option A are very close to these experimental values.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts are too low for aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals and their integrations do not match an aromatic compound with an acetyl group. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 ppm` is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a ketone. An aldehyde-containing compound that fits the C8 and halogen requirement, such as a halomethylbenzaldehyde, would not have the specified aromatic-halogen bond. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only ¹H NMR data that correctly represents the structure of a di-substituted aromatic ring with 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond (specifically a 4'-haloacetophenone) is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
