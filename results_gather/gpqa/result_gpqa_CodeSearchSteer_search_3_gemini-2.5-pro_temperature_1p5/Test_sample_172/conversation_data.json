    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron:\n\n**1. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe relationship between the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The formula for the minimum uncertainty is:\n\nΔp ≥ h / (4πΔx)\n\nwhere:\n*   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position, given as 0.1 nm (0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m).\n\n**2. Calculation of Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the minimum uncertainty in the electron's momentum:\n\nΔp ≈ (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (4 * π * 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m)\nΔp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n**3. Relating Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE) and Momentum (Δp)**\n\nThe uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using the following relationship, derived from the relativistic energy-momentum equation:\n\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\nwhere:\n*   v is the velocity of the electron, given as 2 x 10⁸ m/s.\n\nThis relationship holds because the velocity of the particle is the group velocity of its corresponding wave packet, which is given by dE/dp. For a relativistic particle, this derivative is equal to its velocity v.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE)**\n\nNow, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in the electron's energy:\n\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in the energy is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J. Comparing this value with the given options:\n\nA) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<B>>>"
