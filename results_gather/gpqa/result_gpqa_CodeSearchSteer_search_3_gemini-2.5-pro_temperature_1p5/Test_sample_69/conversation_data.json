    "This is a complex chemical riddle that requires identifying a series of compounds (A-H) based on their reactions. The final question is about the molecular symmetry of product E. A step-by-step deduction points towards a plausible set of identities for the molecules involved.\n\n1.  **Reaction 4: D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent) (1:1 ratio)**: A common reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene (COCl₂) from carbon monoxide (CO) and chlorine (Cl₂). Phosgene is a liquid at room temperature and has been used as a solvent. Let's hypothesize:\n    *   B = CO (Carbon monoxide)\n    *   D = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n    *   H = COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n\n2.  **Reaction 3: C + H₂O → A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)**: This is the most unusual and defining clue. The reaction regenerates the starting material A, and the other products, two acids, must come from the hydrolysis of the part of C that was formed from gas B (CO). This is not a simple hydrolysis. A plausible, albeit complex, scenario involves a compound that can be intercalated into graphite. A possible set of identities could be:\n    *   A = Graphite (a solid form of Carbon)\n    *   F = HCl (a strong acid)\n    *   G = A carboxylic acid like formic acid (a weak acid).\n    The hydrolysis of certain graphite intercalation compounds can lead to the regeneration of graphite and the formation of acids. While the exact nature of C and the mechanism are highly complex, this set of reactants and products is chemically conceivable within the context of a riddle. For this to work, C must contain chlorine. This contradicts its formation from only A and B (CO).\n\n    Let's reconsider. The puzzle is most likely constructed around a known, highly symmetric, and hazardous molecule for E. Given the options, the most common and fitting candidates for E with high symmetry are: Phosgene (COCl₂, **C2v**), Carbon Disulfide (CS₂, **D∞h**), and Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF₄, **D4h**).\n\n3.  **Identifying E and its Symmetry**: Let's analyze the formation of E from the candidates.\n    *   **If E is Phosgene (COCl₂)**: The molecule is trigonal planar. It possesses a C₂ rotational axis and two perpendicular vertical mirror planes (one containing the atoms, and one bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle). This combination of symmetry elements defines the **C2v** point group.\n    *   **If E is Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**: This was the first discovered binary compound of a noble gas and has a square planar geometry. This structure belongs to the **D4h** point group.\n    *   **If E is Carbon Disulfide (CS₂)**: This is a linear molecule (S=C=S) and is symmetrical. Its point group is **D∞h**.\n\nThe provided clues are intricate and partially contradictory, a common feature in chemical riddles designed to test broad chemical knowledge rather than straightforward deduction. Without a clear and consistent pathway to identify all compounds, the most reasonable approach is to identify the molecular symmetry of the most plausible candidate for the \"extremely hazardous product E\".\n\nPhosgene (COCl₂) is infamous for its high toxicity and use as a chemical weapon, making it a very strong candidate for \"extremely hazardous product E\". As established, its molecular symmetry is C2v.\n\n<<<A>>>"
