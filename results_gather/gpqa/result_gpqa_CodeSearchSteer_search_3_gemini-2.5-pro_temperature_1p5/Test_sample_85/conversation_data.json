    "To determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), and understand the subsequent cyclization reactions.\n\nThe potential starting materials are all isomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂). The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH₄\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent known for its ability to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group remains largely unreacted.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group of compound A to a primary alcohol. This creates a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The subsequent addition of acid (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification, known as lactonization, to form the stable six-membered ring lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The series of reactions (reduction and lactonization) does not affect the stereocenter at the carbon bearing the ethyl group. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A must be the same as the product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B: Reduction with BH₃\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that exhibits the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while leaving esters intact.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group of compound B to a primary alcohol, resulting in a 5-hydroxyester. The acidic workup (H⁺) then promotes an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl to form the lactone and release isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction sequence also preserves the original stereocenter.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nCombining these findings, reactant A is the (R)-isomer and reactant B is the (S)-isomer. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
