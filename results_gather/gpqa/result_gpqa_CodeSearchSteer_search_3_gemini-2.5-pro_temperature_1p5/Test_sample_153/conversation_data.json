    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unidentified compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at **m/z = 156** represents the molecular weight of the compound.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** A significant peak is observed at **m/z = 158** with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Isotopic Analysis:** The presence of a molecular ion peak (M+) and an M+2 peak with a height ratio of approximately 3:1 (100% to 32%) is a distinct isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom. The molecular weight of the options (all C7H5ClO2) with the ³⁵Cl isotope is approximately 156 g/mol.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. This strong evidence suggests the presence of a -COOH functional group.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When considered with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid. Conjugation to an aromatic ring can lower the frequency to this range.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The IR data strongly indicate the compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option A (an aldehyde/phenol) and option C (an acid chloride).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-12 ppm range is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The integration for one proton (1H) and its singlet nature (no adjacent protons to couple with) is fully consistent with this assignment.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   There are two signals in the aromatic region, one at 8.02 ppm and another at 7.72 ppm.\n    *   Both signals are doublets, meaning the protons they represent are each adjacent to only one other proton.\n    *   Each signal integrates to 2H, meaning there are two equivalent protons of each type.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic sign of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Remaining Options\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. It would show four distinct and more complex signals in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is a *para*-substituted benzene ring, which has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons adjacent to the carboxylic acid group equivalent and the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom equivalent. This leads to the exact ¹H NMR pattern observed: two doublets, each representing 2H. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group deshields the adjacent protons more, causing them to appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) compared to the protons adjacent to the chlorine (7.72 ppm).\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the combined evidence from Mass Spectrometry (chlorine present), IR spectroscopy (carboxylic acid), and ¹H NMR (carboxylic acid proton and a para-substituted aromatic ring), the only structure that fits all the data is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
