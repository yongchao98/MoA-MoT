    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the relationship:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between parallax and distance.** Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r) of a star. This can be expressed as:\n    plx ∝ 1/r\n\n2.  **Use the given information.** The problem states that the number of stars (N) observed in the region varies inversely with the fifth power of the parallax (plx):\n    N ∝ 1/plx⁵\n\n3.  **Relate the number of stars to distance.** By substituting the relationship from step 1 into the expression from step 2, we can find how the total number of stars up to a certain distance (r) changes with that distance:\n    Since plx ∝ 1/r, we have:\n    N ∝ 1/(1/r)⁵\n    N ∝ r⁵\n\n    This means the total number of stars (N) within a distance *r* is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n4.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of distance.** The question asks how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*. This is asking for the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative of N with respect to r (dN/dr). This value represents the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r.\n\n    To find this, we differentiate the expression from step 3 with respect to r:\n    N = k * r⁵ (where k is a constant of proportionality)\n    dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)\n    dN/dr = 5 * k * r⁴\n\n5.  **Conclusion.** The number of stars per unit range of distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r⁴.\n\n    dN/dr ∝ r⁴\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ r²\nB) ~ r³\nC) ~ r⁵\nD) ~ r⁴\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
