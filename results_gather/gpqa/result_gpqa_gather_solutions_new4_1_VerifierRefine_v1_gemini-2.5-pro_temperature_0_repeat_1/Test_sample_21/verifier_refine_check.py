    # --- Scientific Facts for Verification ---

    # 1. Thermodynamic Facts:
    # The strength of an oxidant is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°).
    # A more positive E° indicates a stronger oxidant.
    E_standard_acidic = 1.23  # V for O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)
    E_standard_basic = 0.40   # V for O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)

    # 2. Kinetic Facts:
    # The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is known to be kinetically sluggish.
    # When comparing acidic vs. basic media, the kinetics are generally more favorable (faster)
    # in alkaline (basic) solutions than in acidic solutions.
    # Therefore, the reaction is "slower" in acidic solutions compared to basic ones.

    # Part 1: Determine the thermodynamic term
    # The question asks about oxygen in BASIC solutions. We compare its strength to the acidic case.
