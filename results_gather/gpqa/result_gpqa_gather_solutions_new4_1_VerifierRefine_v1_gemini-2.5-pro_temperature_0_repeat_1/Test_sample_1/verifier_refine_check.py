    # --- Step 1: Grignard Reaction ---
    # Reactant: trans-cinnamaldehyde (9C)
    # Reagent: methylmagnesium bromide (CH3MgBr). This reagent adds one methyl group (1C).
    # Reaction: 1,2-addition of the methyl group to the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon.
    # Product 1 carbon count = 9 + 1 = 10.

    # --- Step 2: PCC Oxidation ---
    # Reactant: Product 1 (a secondary alcohol).
    # Reagent: Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC).
    # Reaction: Oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone. This reaction does not change the carbon count.
    # Product 2 carbon count = 10 + 0 = 10.

    # --- Step 3: Corey-Chaykovsky Reaction ---
    # Reactant: Product 2 (an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone).
    # Reagent: (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane, also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.
    # Reaction: This sulfur ylide performs a conjugate addition to the C=C double bond, adding a methylene group (CH2, 1C) to form a cyclopropane ring.
