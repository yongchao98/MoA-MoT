    # 1. The key molecular event: Cre-mediated recombination at the lox2272 sites.
    # The construct is: ... Receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP ORF
    # After Cre action, it becomes: ... Receptor ORF -> [single lox2272 site] -> eGFP ORF
    
    # 2. Length of the residual lox site "scar" in base pairs.
    # Standard lox sites (including loxP and its variants like lox2272) are 34 bp long.
    lox_site_scar_length = 34

    # 3. The fundamental rule for creating a functional fusion protein.

    # must be a multiple of 3 to maintain the translational reading frame.

    reasoning_B = "Incorrect. The construct uses a strong CBA promoter, and its ability to express protein was confirmed by Western blot. The system's specificity comes from Cre expression, not a specific enhancer."
