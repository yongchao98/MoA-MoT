def check_quantum_energy_resolution():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the quantum energy resolution problem.

    The core principle is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time:
    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2.
    For practical purposes, the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) ΔE is approximated
    as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime of the state.

    To clearly resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than
    their energy widths. The limiting factor is the state with the larger energy width
    (which corresponds to the shorter lifetime). A common criterion is that the energy
    difference must be greater than the larger of the two widths. A stricter criterion
    is that it must be greater than the sum of the widths. In this problem, both
    criteria lead to the same choice.
