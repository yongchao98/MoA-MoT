    # --- Physics Calculation ---
    # The problem can be solved by applying conservation of energy and momentum.
    # Let m be the rest mass of the electron/positron and c be the speed of light.
    #
    # 1. Conservation of Energy:
    # E_initial = E_electron + E_positron = (gamma_e * m * c^2) + (gamma_p * m * c^2)
    # E_initial = (4 + 2) * m * c^2 = 6 * m * c^2
    # E_final = 2 * E_photon (since photons have equal energy)
    # So, E_photon = 3 * m * c^2
    #
    # 2. Conservation of Momentum:
    # p_initial = p_electron - p_positron (vector subtraction along x-axis)
    # p_particle = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1) * m * c
    # p_initial = (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) * m * c
    # p_final = 2 * p_photon * cos(theta)
    # p_photon = E_photon / c = 3 * m * c
    # p_final = 2 * (3 * m * c) * cos(theta) = 6 * m * c * cos(theta)
    #
    # 3. Equating Momenta and Solving for theta:
    # (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) * m * c = 6 * m * c * cos(theta)
    # cos(theta) = (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) / 6
    # The angle between the photons is 2 * theta.

    try:
        # Calculate the numerator of the cos(theta) expression
        numerator = math.sqrt(gamma_e**2 - 1) - math.sqrt(gamma_p**2 - 1)
        
        # The denominator is gamma_e + gamma_p, which is 6
        denominator = gamma_e + gamma_p
        
        # Calculate cos(theta)
        cos_theta = numerator / denominator
        
        # Calculate theta in radians. This is the angle of one photon with the axis.
        theta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)
        
        # The total angle between the two photons is 2 * theta
        total_angle_rad = 2 * theta_rad
        
        # Convert the final angle to degrees
        calculated_angle_deg = math.degrees(total_angle_rad)

    except ValueError as e:
        return f"Calculation Error: {e}. The value inside acos might be out of the [-1, 1] range."

    # --- Verification ---
    # Check if the calculated angle is close to the expected answer.
    # A tolerance of 1.0 degree is reasonable for a multiple-choice question.
    tolerance = 1.0
