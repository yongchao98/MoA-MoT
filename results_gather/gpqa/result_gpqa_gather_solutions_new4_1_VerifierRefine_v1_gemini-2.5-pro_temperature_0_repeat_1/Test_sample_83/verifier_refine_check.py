    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer about parallelizing
    the solution of the heat equation.

    The question asks for the key factor that converts a sequential algorithm into a parallel one
    when using a fractional approximation for the matrix exponential.

    Step-by-step reasoning:
    1.  **Problem Formulation**: Solving a higher-dimensional heat equation via the method of lines
        (discretizing in space first) results in a large system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
        of the form dU/dt = AU.
    2.  **Formal Solution**: The solution over a time step Δt is U(t+Δt) = exp(AΔt)U(t).
    3.  **Approximation**: The matrix exponential `exp(z)` is approximated by a rational function
        (the "fractional approximation") R(z) = P(z)/Q(z). The update step becomes
        U_new ≈ R(AΔt)U_old.
    4.  **Sequential Algorithm**: This involves solving the large linear system Q(AΔt)U_new = P(AΔt)U_old.
        This is a single, large, computationally intensive step, making it sequential.
    5.  **Parallelization Strategy**: The goal is to "split" this single large task into multiple smaller,
        *independent* tasks that can be solved simultaneously.
    6.  **The Key Mechanism**: The mathematical technique of **partial fraction decomposition** allows the
        rational function R(z) to be rewritten as a sum of simpler terms:
        R(z) = c + Σ [c_j / (z - d_j)]
        Applying this to the matrix AΔt, the update becomes:
        U_new = (c*I + Σ [c_j * (AΔt - d_j*I)⁻¹]) * U_old
        This means the problem is reduced to solving a set of *independent* linear systems of the form
        (AΔt - d_j*I)y_j = U_old for each j. These systems can be solved in parallel on different processors.
    7.  **Conclusion**: The ability to perform this decomposition is the key factor that enables the conversion
        from a sequential to a parallel algorithm.

    Evaluating the options:
    - A) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: This makes parallelization harder, not easier.
    - B) Stability analysis: This is a prerequisite for a *valid* algorithm (both sequential and parallel),
      but it is not the *mechanism* that creates parallelism.
    - C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: This is a detail of the decomposition. The decomposition
      itself is the key, regardless of whether the roots are real or complex.
    - D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: This is the precise mathematical technique that
      splits the problem into independent, parallelizable sub-tasks. This is the correct answer.
