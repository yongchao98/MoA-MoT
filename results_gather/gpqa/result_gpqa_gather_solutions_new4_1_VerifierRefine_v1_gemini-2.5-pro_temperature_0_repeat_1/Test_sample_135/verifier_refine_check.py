    This function verifies the solution to the given physics problem by
    symbolically calculating the surface integral from the Divergence Theorem.

    The problem is to find the volume integral of the divergence of f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat.
    By the Divergence Theorem, this is equal to the flux of f through the surface
    of the sphere of radius R.

    Flux = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)
