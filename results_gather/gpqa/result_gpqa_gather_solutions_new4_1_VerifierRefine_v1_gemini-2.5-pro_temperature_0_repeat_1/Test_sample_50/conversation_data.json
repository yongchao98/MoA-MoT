This method simplifies the problem by replacing the conducting sphere with an \"image\" charge that replicates the electric field outside the sphere.\n\n### The Method of Images\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge *q* at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R* (where *d* > *R*), the effect of the induced charges on the sphere's surface can be modeled by a single image charge, *q'*. This image charge is located inside the sphere along the line connecting the center and the charge *q*.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is: *q'* = -(*R*/*d*) *q*.\n    *   The position of the image charge from the center is: *d'* = *R*²/*d*.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from an infinite distance to the distance *d* from the sphere's center. This work is done against the attractive force exerted by the induced surface charge, which is equivalent to the force from the image charge *q'*.\n\n    The potential energy (U) of the charge *q* due to the potential created by the image charge *q'* is given by half of the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. The factor of 1/2 arises because as the charge *q* is moved, the induced charge distribution on the sphere continuously readjusts, and the work done to create this induced distribution is equal to the work done to move the charge *q* in the field of the induced charges.\n\n    The potential (V') created by the image charge *q'* at the location of the real charge *q* is:\n    V' = k * q' / (d - d')\n    where k is Coulomb's constant (1/4πε₀).\n\n    Substituting the values for *q'* and *d'*:\n    V' = k * [-(*R*/*d*) *q*] / (*d* - *R*²/*d*)\n    V' = -k * (*R*/*d*) *q* / [(*d*² - *R*²)/ *d*]\n    V' = -k * *q* *R* / (*d*² - *R*²)\n\n    The potential energy of the system is then:\n    U = (1/2) * q * V'\n    U = (1/2) * q * [-k * *q* *R* / (*d*² - *R*²)]\n    U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (*d*² - *R*²)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (*d*² - *R*²)\nB) U = - (1/2) * k * q² * d / (*d*² + *R*²)\nC) U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R² / (*d*² - *R*²)\nD) U = - k * q² * d / (*d*² - *R*²)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images. This method allows us to replace the grounded conducting sphere with an \"image\" charge, which, together with the original charge, satisfies the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and its Location**: For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`), the equivalent image charge `q'` is placed along the same line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -(R/d)q`.\n    *   The location of the image charge is at a distance `b = R²/d` from the center, inside the sphere.\n\n2.  **Calculating the Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. In the image method, this force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The force `F` on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is the Coulomb force between `q` and the image charge `q' = -(R/x)q` located at `b = R²/x`. The distance between them is `x - b = x - R²/x = (x² - R²)/x`.\n\n    The force as a function of `x` is:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)² = k * q * [-(R/x)q] / [(x² - R²)/x]² = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. This is the integral of the force from `d` to infinity:\n    `U = ∫[d to ∞] F(x) dx = ∫[d to ∞] -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)² dx`\n\n    To solve this integral, we can use a substitution. Let `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n    `U = -k * q² * R * ∫[d²-R² to ∞] (1/u²) * (du/2)`\n    `U = -(k * q² * R / 2) * [-1/u] from (d² - R²) to ∞`\n    `U = -(k * q² * R / 2) * [0 - (-1 / (d² - R²))]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n    An alternative way to think about this is that the potential energy of the charge `q` in the potential `V_image` created by the image charge is `U = (1/2)qV_image`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge (and thus its potential) is established as the charge `q` is brought from infinity.\n\n    The potential at the location of `q` (distance `d`) due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - b) = k * [-(R/d)q] / (d - R²/d) = -k * q² * R / (d(d² - R²)/d) = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n    The potential energy is:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_image = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)] = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: Comparing this result with the given options:\n    *   A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    *   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   C) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere, due to the point charge `q`, are identical to the field and potential produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere, with the sphere itself removed.\n\n**1. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` and a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from its center (`d > R`), the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center along the same line as `q`) are chosen to make the potential on the spherical surface (at radius `R`) equal to zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n\n*   **Position of the image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, and the real charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the grounded sphere.\n\nA common mistake is to calculate the potential energy of the two-charge system (`q` and `q'`) directly as `U = kqq' / (d-b)`. This is incorrect because the image charge `q'` is not a fixed charge; its magnitude and position depend on the position of the real charge `q`.\n\nThe correct way to calculate the energy is to use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).\n\n*   The potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n*   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n*   So, `V_induced` is the potential at `d` due to `q'` at `b`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n`d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, calculate the potential energy `U`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n**Alternative Method (Work Integral):**\nThe potential energy is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d`. The force on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by the image charge:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\nThe potential energy is the integral of the external force (`-F(x)`) from infinity to `d`:\n`U = ∫(from ∞ to d) -F(x) dx = ∫(from ∞ to d) [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\nUsing the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, the integral evaluates to:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe correct answer is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem and the Method of Images**\n\n*   **System:** We have a point charge `q` and a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Condition:** The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V = 0).\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n*   **Method:** This is a classic electrostatics problem solved using the \"method of images.\" The effect of the grounded sphere on the external charge `q` can be perfectly replicated by removing the sphere and placing an \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the original sphere's volume. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` and its position `b` (measured from the center, along the same line as `d`) are given by the standard formulas:\n\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n**Careful Point:** The image charge is located inside the sphere (`b < R` since `d > R`) and has the opposite sign to the real charge `q`. This ensures an attractive force.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`, while the sphere remains grounded. There are two common ways to calculate this.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force (Work Done)**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent against the electric force from the sphere.\n`U = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n\n*   **Force `F(x)`:** The force on the charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `b(x)`.\n    *   `q'(x) = -q * (R / x)`\n    *   `b(x) = R^2 / x`\n    *   Distance between `q` at `x` and `q'(x)` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`.\n    *   `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R/x * 1/((x^2-R^2)/x)^2`\n    *   `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R/x * x^2/(x^2-R^2)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\n*   **Integration:** Now we integrate to find the work.\n    *   `U = - ∫[∞, d] (-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R ∫[∞, d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n    *   Using substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`. The integral becomes `∫(1/u^2) (du/2) = -1/(2u)`.\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n    *   The term with infinity goes to zero.\n    *   `U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2(d^2 - R^2)) = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\n\nA more direct method uses the formula for the energy of a system of charges and conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n*   **`V_induced`:** This is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all *other* charges, which in this case are the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   **Careful Point:** The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charges (and the potential they create) are themselves proportional to `q`. The energy is not simply `qV` as it would be for a test charge in a fixed external potential.\n*   **Calculation:** The potential from the induced charges at distance `d` is the same as the potential from the image charge `q'` at that point.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n    *   Distance = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   **Final Energy:** Substitute this potential back into the energy formula.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Final Answer Analysis**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, has `R^2` instead of `R`.\nB) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, missing the `1/2` factor and has `d` instead of `R`.\nC) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **This matches our result.**\nD) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect numerator and denominator.\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is negative, which makes physical sense because the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive. Work is done by the field as the charge is brought from infinity, so the potential energy of the system decreases from its zero reference at infinity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at an electric potential of zero (V = 0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` will induce charges to redistribute on the surface of the sphere. The electric field and potential outside the sphere are the result of both the original charge `q` and this induced surface charge.\n\nThe \"method of images\" is a powerful technique to solve this problem. It allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed at a specific location (`b`) inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Location\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, along the same line as the original charge. The values are given by:\n\n*   **Location of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nThe system of the real charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere is now replaced by a simpler system of two point charges: the real charge `q` at `d` and the image charge `q'` at `b`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. As the charge `q` moves, the induced charge on the sphere (and thus the image charge `q'`) continuously changes. Therefore, we must integrate the force on the charge `q` as it is brought in from infinity.\n\nLet the charge `q` be at a variable position `x` from the center of the sphere (`x` goes from `∞` to `d`).\n\n1.  **Force on the charge `q` at position `x`:**\n    The force on the real charge `q` is due to the attraction from the sphere. In our image model, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n    At position `x`, the image charge has a magnitude `q'(x) = -qR/x` and is located at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    The distance between the real charge `q` at `x` and the image charge `q'` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    The force `F(x)` on the charge `q` is:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2`\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R / (x * (x^2 - R^2)^2 / x^2)`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive.\n\n2.  **Work Done (Potential Energy):**\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n    `U = W_ext = - ∫[from ∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[from d to ∞] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[from d to ∞] [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n3.  **Solving the Integral:**\n    We can solve this integral using a u-substitution.\n    Let `u = x^2 - R^2`. Then `du = 2x dx`, which means `x dx = du / 2`.\n    The limits of integration also change:\n    *   When `x = d`, `u = d^2 - R^2`.\n    *   When `x → ∞`, `u → ∞`.\n\n    Now substitute into the integral:\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R * ∫[from d^2-R^2 to ∞] (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * ∫[from d^2-R^2 to ∞] u^-2 du`\n    The integral of `u^-2` is `-u^-1`.\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u] |_[from d^2-R^2 to ∞]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [1/u] |_[from d^2-R^2 to ∞]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [ (lim u→∞ 1/u) - (1 / (d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [ 0 - 1 / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   B) `U = - k * q^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   C) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n*   D) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur derived expression matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and held at a constant potential of zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this V=0 condition. This results in an attractive force between the charge `q` and the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem is most easily solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced surface charges on the sphere, are identical to the field and potential created by the original charge `q` and a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The sphere itself is removed in this model.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    For the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) to be zero, the image charge `q'` must be:\n    *   Located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. The position is given by:\n        `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   Have a magnitude and sign given by:\n        `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n    Note that since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), the image charge position `b` is inside the sphere (`b < R`), and its sign is opposite to that of `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble it. A key formula for the interaction energy `U` between a point charge `q` and a conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge distribution is created by and dependent on the presence of `q`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Induced Potential (V_induced):**\n    Using our image charge model, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n    *   The position of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The position of `q'` is at distance `b` from the center.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n    The potential `V_induced` is therefore:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`1 / (4πε₀)`).\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    Now, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b` into the formula for `V_induced`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n\n    Simplify the denominator:\n    `d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\n    The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancel out:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy (U):**\n    Now, substitute this expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Let's compare our result with the given choices:\n    A) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` (Incorrect, has R²)\n    B) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` (Incorrect, has d in numerator and + in denominator)\n    C) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` (This matches our derived result)\n    D) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` (Incorrect, missing 1/2 and has d instead of R)\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`. It is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0).\n*   A point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere. We must have `d > R`.\n*   The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain the V=0 condition.\n*   We need to find the potential energy of this entire system. The potential energy is the work done by an external agent to assemble the system, i.e., to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the grounded sphere.\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\n\nThis problem is elegantly solved using the \"method of images.\" The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the induced surface charges, can be perfectly replicated by a single, fictitious \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed *inside* the sphere.\n\nThe properties of this image charge are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the sphere's surface (at radius `R`) is zero. For a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) are given by:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located on the line connecting the center and the real charge `q`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy `U`.\n\n#### Method 1: Integrating the Force\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work an external agent must do to bring the charge `q` from infinity (`x = ∞`) to its final position (`x = d`). This is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n\n`U = -W_field = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F_e(x) dx`\n\nWhere `F_e(x)` is the electric force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center. By the method of images, this force is simply the Coulomb force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'(x)` at its corresponding position `b(x)`.\n\n*   At a distance `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n*   The distance between `q` (at `x`) and `q'(x)` (at `b(x)`) is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n*   The force on `q` is:\n    `F_e(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F_e(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we integrate to find the potential energy:\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use a u-substitution: `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`∫ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = ∫ [1 / u^2] * (du / 2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ] (from ∞ to d)`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))) ]`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0 ]`\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\n#### Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula\n\nThe energy of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges.\n\nIn our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced + (1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`\n\n*   The sphere is grounded, so its potential `V_sphere` is 0. The second term vanishes.\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nWe can find `V_induced` by calculating the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n\n*   Location of `q`: distance `d` from the center.\n*   Location of `q'`: distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'`: `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n*   Potential at `d` due to `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * (k * q^2 * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nI have analyzed the problem using the method of images, which is the standard approach for this type of electrostatics problem.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Use the method of images to find the equivalent image charge `q'` and its position `b` that correctly models the grounded conducting sphere.\n2.  Calculate the potential energy of the system. The potential energy is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. This is equal to `(1/2) * q * V_image`, where `V_image` is the potential at the location of `q` due to the image charge.\n\n**Execution:**\n1.  **Image Charge and Position:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge is `q' = -q(R/d)` located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and `q`.\n\n2.  **Potential due to Image Charge:** The potential at the location of the real charge `q` (at distance `d`) due to the image charge `q'` (at distance `b`) is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n    `V_image = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    `V_image = -k * qR / [d * (d - R^2/d)]`\n    `V_image = -k * qR / [d^2 - R^2]`\n\n3.  **Potential Energy of the System:** The work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere is half the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. The factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is not fixed but builds up as `q` is brought in from infinity.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics and the Method\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge is located at a distance `d` from the sphere's center.\nThe most effective way to solve this is using the **method of images**. This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the grounded sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The electric field and potential outside the sphere are then the superposition of the fields from the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Image Charge and its Position\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (from the center) are given by the standard formulas:\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge is located on the line connecting the center and the real charge `q`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Potential Energy\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common mistake is to simply calculate the interaction energy between `q` and `q'` as `k*q*q'/(d-b)`. This is incorrect because the image charge `q'` is not a fixed charge; its existence depends on `q`.\n\nThe correct formula for the potential energy `U` of a charge `q` interacting with the induced charges on a grounded conductor is:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nHere, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. In the image method, this is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Induced Potential (V_induced)\n1.  The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n2.  Substitute the expression for `b`: `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n3.  Now, calculate the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` due to `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n4.  Simplify the expression. The `d` in the denominator of the numerator cancels with the `d` in the denominator of the denominator:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Potential Energy (U)\nNow, substitute the expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Step 6: Compare with the Given Options\nLet's compare our derived result with the options provided in the question:\nA) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect. Missing the `1/2` factor and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\nB) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **This exactly matches our derived result.**\nC) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect. Has `R^2` instead of `R`.\nD) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics and the Method\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge is located at a distance `d` from the sphere's center.\nThe most effective way to solve this is using the **method of images**. This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the grounded sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The electric field and potential outside the sphere are then the superposition of the fields from the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Image Charge and its Position\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (from the center) are given by the standard formulas:\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge is located on the line connecting the center and the real charge `q`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Potential Energy\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common mistake is to simply calculate the interaction energy between `q` and `q'` as `k*q*q'/(d-b)`. This is incorrect because the image charge `q'` is not a fixed charge; its existence depends on `q`.\n\nThe correct formula for the potential energy `U` of a charge `q` interacting with the induced charges on a grounded conductor is:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nHere, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. In the image method, this is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Induced Potential (V_induced)\n1.  The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n2.  Substitute the expression for `b`: `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n3.  Now, calculate the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` due to `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n4.  Simplify the expression. The `d` in the denominator of the numerator cancels with the `d` in the denominator of the denominator:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Potential Energy (U)\nNow, substitute the expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Step 6: Compare with the Given Options\nLet's compare our derived result with the options provided in the question:\nA) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect. Missing the `1/2` factor and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\nB) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **This exactly matches our derived result.**\nC) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect. Has `R^2` instead of `R`.\nD) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect. Has `d` instead of `R` and a `+` sign in the denominator.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most of them correctly derive the formula, there is significant confusion in matching it to the correct letter, likely due to inconsistent option lists. However, the physics derivation is consistent and points to a single correct formula. Based on the prompt's options, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

This method simplifies the problem by replacing the conducting sphere with an \"image\" charge that replicates the electric field outside the sphere.\n\n### The Method of Images\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge *q* at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R* (where *d* > *R*), the effect of the induced charges on the sphere's surface can be modeled by a single image charge, *q'*. This image charge is located inside the sphere along the line connecting the center and the charge *q*.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is: *q'* = -(*R*/*d*) *q*.\n    *   The position of the image charge from the center is: *d'* = *R*²/*d*.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from an infinite distance to the distance *d* from the sphere's center. This work is done against the attractive force exerted by the induced surface charge, which is equivalent to the force from the image charge *q'*.\n\n    The potential energy (U) of the charge *q* due to the potential created by the image charge *q'* is given by half of the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. The factor of 1/2 arises because as the charge *q* is moved, the induced charge distribution on the sphere continuously readjusts, and the work done to create this induced distribution is equal to the work done to move the charge *q* in the field of the induced charges.\n\n    The potential (V') created by the image charge *q'* at the location of the real charge *q* is:\n    V' = k * q' / (d - d')\n    where k is Coulomb's constant (1/4πε₀).\n\n    Substituting the values for *q'* and *d'*:\n    V' = k * [-(*R*/*d*) *q*] / (*d* - *R*²/*d*)\n    V' = -k * (*R*/*d*) *q* / [(*d*² - *R*²)/ *d*]\n    V' = -k * *q* *R* / (*d*² - *R*²)\n\n    The potential energy of the system is then:\n    U = (1/2) * q * V'\n    U = (1/2) * q * [-k * *q* *R* / (*d*² - *R*²)]\n    U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (*d*² - *R*²)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (*d*² - *R*²)\nB) U = - (1/2) * k * q² * d / (*d*² + *R*²)\nC) U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R² / (*d*² - *R*²)\nD) U = - k * q² * d / (*d*² - *R*²)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images. This method allows us to replace the grounded conducting sphere with an \"image\" charge, which, together with the original charge, satisfies the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and its Location**: For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`), the equivalent image charge `q'` is placed along the same line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -(R/d)q`.\n    *   The location of the image charge is at a distance `b = R²/d` from the center, inside the sphere.\n\n2.  **Calculating the Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. In the image method, this force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The force `F` on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is the Coulomb force between `q` and the image charge `q' = -(R/x)q` located at `b = R²/x`. The distance between them is `x - b = x - R²/x = (x² - R²)/x`.\n\n    The force as a function of `x` is:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)² = k * q * [-(R/x)q] / [(x² - R²)/x]² = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. This is the integral of the force from `d` to infinity:\n    `U = ∫[d to ∞] F(x) dx = ∫[d to ∞] -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)² dx`\n\n    To solve this integral, we can use a substitution. Let `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n    `U = -k * q² * R * ∫[d²-R² to ∞] (1/u²) * (du/2)`\n    `U = -(k * q² * R / 2) * [-1/u] from (d² - R²) to ∞`\n    `U = -(k * q² * R / 2) * [0 - (-1 / (d² - R²))]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n    An alternative way to think about this is that the potential energy of the charge `q` in the potential `V_image` created by the image charge is `U = (1/2)qV_image`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge (and thus its potential) is established as the charge `q` is brought from infinity.\n\n    The potential at the location of `q` (distance `d`) due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - b) = k * [-(R/d)q] / (d - R²/d) = -k * q² * R / (d(d² - R²)/d) = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n    The potential energy is:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_image = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)] = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: Comparing this result with the given options:\n    *   A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    *   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   C) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere, due to the point charge `q`, are identical to the field and potential produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere, with the sphere itself removed.\n\n**1. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` and a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from its center (`d > R`), the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center along the same line as `q`) are chosen to make the potential on the spherical surface (at radius `R`) equal to zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n\n*   **Position of the image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, and the real charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the grounded sphere.\n\nA common mistake is to calculate the potential energy of the two-charge system (`q` and `q'`) directly as `U = kqq' / (d-b)`. This is incorrect because the image charge `q'` is not a fixed charge; its magnitude and position depend on the position of the real charge `q`.\n\nThe correct way to calculate the energy is to use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).\n\n*   The potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n*   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n*   So, `V_induced` is the potential at `d` due to `q'` at `b`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n`d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, calculate the potential energy `U`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n**Alternative Method (Work Integral):**\nThe potential energy is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d`. The force on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by the image charge:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\nThe potential energy is the integral of the external force (`-F(x)`) from infinity to `d`:\n`U = ∫(from ∞ to d) -F(x) dx = ∫(from ∞ to d) [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\nUsing the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, the integral evaluates to:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe correct answer is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem and the Method of Images**\n\n*   **System:** We have a point charge `q` and a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Condition:** The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V = 0).\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n*   **Method:** This is a classic electrostatics problem solved using the \"method of images.\" The effect of the grounded sphere on the external charge `q` can be perfectly replicated by removing the sphere and placing an \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the original sphere's volume. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` and its position `b` (measured from the center, along the same line as `d`) are given by the standard formulas:\n\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n**Careful Point:** The image charge is located inside the sphere (`b < R` since `d > R`) and has the opposite sign to the real charge `q`. This ensures an attractive force.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`, while the sphere remains grounded. There are two common ways to calculate this.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force (Work Done)**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent against the electric force from the sphere.\n`U = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n\n*   **Force `F(x)`:** The force on the charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `b(x)`.\n    *   `q'(x) = -q * (R / x)`\n    *   `b(x) = R^2 / x`\n    *   Distance between `q` at `x` and `q'(x)` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`.\n    *   `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R/x * 1/((x^2-R^2)/x)^2`\n    *   `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R/x * x^2/(x^2-R^2)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\n*   **Integration:** Now we integrate to find the work.\n    *   `U = - ∫[∞, d] (-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R ∫[∞, d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n    *   Using substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`. The integral becomes `∫(1/u^2) (du/2) = -1/(2u)`.\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n    *   The term with infinity goes to zero.\n    *   `U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2(d^2 - R^2)) = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\n\nA more direct method uses the formula for the energy of a system of charges and conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n*   **`V_induced`:** This is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all *other* charges, which in this case are the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   **Careful Point:** The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charges (and the potential they create) are themselves proportional to `q`. The energy is not simply `qV` as it would be for a test charge in a fixed external potential.\n*   **Calculation:** The potential from the induced charges at distance `d` is the same as the potential from the image charge `q'` at that point.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n    *   Distance = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   **Final Energy:** Substitute this potential back into the energy formula.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Final Answer Analysis**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, has `R^2` instead of `R`.\nB) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, missing the `1/2` factor and has `d` instead of `R`.\nC) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **This matches our result.**\nD) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect numerator and denominator.\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is negative, which makes physical sense because the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive. Work is done by the field as the charge is brought from infinity, so the potential energy of the system decreases from its zero reference at infinity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at an electric potential of zero (V = 0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` will induce charges to redistribute on the surface of the sphere. The electric field and potential outside the sphere are the result of both the original charge `q` and this induced surface charge.\n\nThe \"method of images\" is a powerful technique to solve this problem. It allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed at a specific location (`b`) inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Location\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, along the same line as the original charge. The values are given by:\n\n*   **Location of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nThe system of the real charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere is now replaced by a simpler system of two point charges: the real charge `q` at `d` and the image charge `q'` at `b`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. As the charge `q` moves, the induced charge on the sphere (and thus the image charge `q'`) continuously changes. Therefore, we must integrate the force on the charge `q` as it is brought in from infinity.\n\nLet the charge `q` be at a variable position `x` from the center of the sphere (`x` goes from `∞` to `d`).\n\n1.  **Force on the charge `q` at position `x`:**\n    The force on the real charge `q` is due to the attraction from the sphere. In our image model, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n    At position `x`, the image charge has a magnitude `q'(x) = -qR/x` and is located at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    The distance between the real charge `q` at `x` and the image charge `q'` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    The force `F(x)` on the charge `q` is:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2`\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R / (x * (x^2 - R^2)^2 / x^2)`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive.\n\n2.  **Work Done (Potential Energy):**\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n    `U = W_ext = - ∫[from ∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[from d to ∞] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[from d to ∞] [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n3.  **Solving the Integral:**\n    We can solve this integral using a u-substitution.\n    Let `u = x^2 - R^2`.

The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and held at a constant potential of zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this V=0 condition. This results in an attractive force between the charge `q` and the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem is most easily solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced surface charges on the sphere, are identical to the field and potential created by the original charge `q` and a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The sphere itself is removed in this model.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    For the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) to be zero, the image charge `q'` must be:\n    *   Located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. The position is given by:\n        `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   Have a magnitude and sign given by:\n        `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n    Note that since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), the image charge position `b` is inside the sphere (`b < R`), and its sign is opposite to that of `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble it. A key formula for the interaction energy `U` between a point charge `q` and a conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge distribution is created by and dependent on the presence of `q`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Induced Potential (V_induced):**\n    Using our image charge model, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n    *   The position of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The position of `q'` is at distance `b` from the center.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n    The potential `V_induced` is therefore:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`1 / (4πε₀)`).\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    Now, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b` into the formula for `V_induced`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n\n    Simplify the denominator:\n    `d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\n    The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancel out:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy (U):**\n    Now, substitute this expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Let's compare our result with the given choices:\n    A) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` (Incorrect, has R²)\n    B) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` (Incorrect, has d in numerator and + in denominator)\n    C) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` (This matches our derived result)\n    D) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` (Incorrect, missing 1/2 and has d instead of R)\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`. It is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0).\n*   A point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere. We must have `d > R`.\n*   The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain the V=0 condition.\n*   We need to find the potential energy of this entire system. The potential energy is the work done by an external agent to assemble the system, i.e., to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the grounded sphere.\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\n\nThis problem is elegantly solved using the \"method of images.\" The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the induced surface charges, can be perfectly replicated by a single, fictitious \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed *inside* the sphere.\n\nThe properties of this image charge are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the sphere's surface (at radius `R`) is zero. For a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) are given by:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located on the line connecting the center and the real charge `q`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy `U`.\n\n#### Method 1: Integrating the Force\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work an external agent must do to bring the charge `q` from infinity (`x = ∞`) to its final position (`x = d`). This is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n\n`U = -W_field = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F_e(x) dx`\n\nWhere `F_e(x)` is the electric force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center. By the method of images, this force is simply the Coulomb force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'(x)` at its corresponding position `b(x)`.\n\n*   At a distance `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n*   The distance between `q` (at `x`) and `q'(x)` (at `b(x)`) is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n*   The force on `q` is:\n    `F_e(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F_e(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we integrate to find the potential energy:\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use a u-substitution: `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`∫ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = ∫ [1 / u^2] * (du / 2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ] (from ∞ to d)`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))) ]`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0 ]`\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\n#### Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula\n\nThe energy of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges.\n\nIn our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced + (1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`\n\n*   The sphere is grounded, so its potential `V_sphere` is 0. The second term vanishes.\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nWe can find `V_induced` by calculating the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n\n*   Location of `q`: distance `d` from the center.\n*   Location of `q'`: distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'`: `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n*   Potential at `d` due to `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * (k * q^2 * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nI have analyzed the problem using the method of images, which is the standard approach for this type of electrostatics problem.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Use the method of images to find the equivalent image charge `q'` and its position `b` that correctly models the grounded conducting sphere.\n2.  Calculate the potential energy of the system. The potential energy is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. This is equal to `(1/2) * q * V_image`, where `V_image` is the potential at the location of `q` due to the image charge.\n\n**Execution:**\n1.  **Image Charge and Position:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge is `q' = -q(R/d)` located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and `q`.\n\n2.  **Potential due to Image Charge:** The potential at the location of the real charge `q` (at distance `d`) due to the image charge `q'` (at distance `b`) is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n    `V_image = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    `V_image = -k * qR / [d * (d - R^2/d)]`\n    `V_image = -k * qR / [d^2 - R^2]`\n\n3.  **Potential Energy of the System:** The work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere is half the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. The factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is not fixed but builds up as `q` is brought in from infinity.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images.

The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the energy is stored in the electric field, which only exists in the region outside the sphere.\n\n4.  **Interaction Energy**: The potential energy of interaction between two point charges is given by `U = k * (q1 * q2) / r`, where `r` is the distance between them.\n    *   The real charge is `q`.\n    *   The image charge is `q' = -qR/d`.\n    *   The distance between them is `d - d' = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n\n5.  **Calculation**:\n    *   First, calculate the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the image charge `q'`:\n        `V' = k * q' / (d - d') = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   The interaction energy between `q` and `q'` is `U_interaction = q * V' = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    *   The net potential energy of the system is half of this interaction energy:\n        `U = (1/2) * U_interaction = (1/2) * [-k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n\nInitial answer:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics and the Method\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge is located at a distance `d` from the sphere's center.\nThe most effective way to solve this is using the **method of images**. This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the grounded sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The electric field and potential outside the sphere are then the superposition of the fields from the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Image Charge and its Position\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (from the center) are given by the standard formulas:\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge is located on the line connecting the center and the real charge `q`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Potential Energy\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common mistake is to simply calculate the interaction energy between `q` and `q'` as `k*q*q'/(d-b)`. This is incorrect because the image charge `q'` is not a fixed charge; its existence depends on `q`.\n\nThe correct formula for the potential energy `U` of a charge `q` interacting with the induced charges on a grounded conductor is:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nHere, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. In the image method, this is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Induced Potential (V_induced)\n1.  The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n2.  Substitute the expression for `b`: `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n3.  Now, calculate the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` due to `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n4.  Simplify the expression. The `d` in the denominator of the numerator cancels with the `d` in the denominator of the denominator:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Potential Energy (U)\nNow, substitute the expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Step 6: Compare with the Given Options\nLet's compare our derived result with the options provided in the question:\nA) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect. Missing the `1/2` factor and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\nB) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **This exactly matches our derived result.**\nC) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect. Has `R^2` instead of `R`.\nD) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect. Has `d` instead of `R` and a `+` sign in the denominator.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most of them correctly derive the formula, there is significant confusion in matching it to the correct letter, likely due to inconsistent option lists. However, the physics derivation is consistent and points to a single correct formula. Based on the prompt's options, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\nChecker feedback:\noutput: Correct\n"
