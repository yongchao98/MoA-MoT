    # A key property is [A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C] for a given star.

    # Step 1: Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance for Star 1, [Si/H]_1
    # [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1
    si_h_1 = si_fe_1 + fe_h_1
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance for Star 2, [Si/H]_2
    # We use the property [Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2
    # Rearranging gives: [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2
    si_h_2 = mg_h_2 - mg_si_2
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the ratio of silicon abundances R = (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2
    # In logarithmic form: log10(R) = log10((n_Si/n_H)_1) - log10((n_Si/n_H)_2)
