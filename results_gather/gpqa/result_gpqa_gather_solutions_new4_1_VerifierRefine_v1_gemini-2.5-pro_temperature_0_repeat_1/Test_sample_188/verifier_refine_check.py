def check_particle_physics_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the particle physics question.

    The question asks to identify the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken
    symmetry in the same way as the others. This "way" is being a Goldstone boson,
    a direct consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB).

    The code verifies this by:
    1. Defining the physical classification of each particle (Goldstone boson vs. other).
    2. Identifying the single particle that is not a Goldstone boson.
    3. Comparing this identified particle with the given answer.
