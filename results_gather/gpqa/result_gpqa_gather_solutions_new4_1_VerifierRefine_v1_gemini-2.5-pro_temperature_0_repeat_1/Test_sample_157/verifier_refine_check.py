    # --- Analysis of the Biological Concepts ---
    # 1. Protein Type: A transcription factor that must form a dimer to be functional.
    # 2. Mutation Type: 'Dominant-negative'. This means the mutant protein product not only loses its own function
    #    but also actively interferes with the function of the normal (wild-type) protein.
    # 3. Interference Mechanism: Since the protein is a dimer and the mutation is in the dimerization domain,
    #    the interference must occur via dimerization. The mutant protein must be able to bind to the wild-type
    #    protein, forming a non-functional heterodimer (a "poisoned" complex).
    # 4. Genetic Consequence: The wild-type protein is sequestered and inactivated, leading to a "loss-of-function
    #    of the wild-type allele's product". This is the textbook definition of the dominant-negative effect.
    # 5. Molecular Consequence: Such non-functional or misfolded protein complexes are often recognized by the
    #    cell's quality control machinery (e.g., the ubiquitin-proteasome system) and targeted for degradation.

'Protein degradation' is a very common and plausible molecular mechanism for how the cell eliminates the resulting non-functional heterodimers, thereby destroying the wild-type protein along with the mutant."

            "is_correct": False,
            "reason": "This option is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation requires the mutant protein to interact with (dimerize with) the wild-type protein. A complete 'loss of protein dimerization' would prevent this interference, making the mutation recessive, not dominant. Also, a dominant mutation causes a mutant phenotype, not a 'wild-type phenotype'."

            "is_correct": False,
            "reason": "This option is plausible but less precise than A. While 'protein aggregation' can cause a 'loss-of-function phenotype', the phrase 'loss-of-function of the wild-type allele' in option A is a more specific and accurate description of the genetic effect. Aggregation is one possible outcome of misfolding, but degradation of the specific non-functional dimer is a more general and widely accepted mechanism, and option A's genetic description is superior."

# If provided_answer were 'C', it would output the reason why 'C' is incorrect and 'A' is correct.
