    # --- Step-by-step Derivation and Calculation ---

    # 1. The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties
    #    (effective temperature T_star, radius R_star), the planet's albedo (A), and
    #    its semi-major axis (a). The formula is:
    #    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))
    #
    #    Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the ratio
    #    T_eq1 / T_eq2 simplifies to:
    #    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)

    # 2. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of a star due to an orbiting planet
    #    in a circular orbit (which is implied by the transit detection) is given by:
    #    K ≈ (M_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G)) / sqrt(M_star * a)
    #    where M_p is planet mass, M_star is star mass, G is gravitational constant,
    #    and i is the orbital inclination.
    #    Since the planets are transiting, we assume i ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.
    #    The star's mass (M_star) and G are constant for both planets.
    #    Therefore, K is proportional to M_p / sqrt(a).
    #    K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a)

    # 3. From the proportionality in step 2, we can express 'a' in terms of K and M_p:
    #    sqrt(a) ∝ M_p / K  =>  a ∝ (M_p / K)^2

    # 4. Now, we can find the ratio a2 / a1:
    #    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / K2)^2 / (M_p1 / K1)^2 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2

    # 5. Substitute the expression for a2/a1 back into the temperature ratio equation from step 1:
    #    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2 )
    #    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)

    # 6. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured
    #    Doppler shift Δλ. Therefore, the ratio of K's is the same as the ratio of Δλ's.
    #    K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2
    k_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2

    # 7. Calculate the mass ratio M_p2 / M_p1.
    mass_ratio = m2 / m1

    # 8. Calculate the final temperature ratio.
    temp_ratio = mass_ratio * k_ratio
