    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the enthalpy of neutralization problem.

    The problem involves two reactions:
    1. Neutralization: H+ + OH- -> H2O
    2. Precipitation: Ba^2+ + SO4^2- -> BaSO4(s)

    The question asks for the "enthalpy of neutralization". In the context of multiple-choice questions,
    this typically refers only to the heat evolved from the formation of water. The code will verify the
    answer based on this common interpretation.
