Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:

**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**
*   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`
*   **Identify the reaction type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to a carbonyl group, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin. The reaction adds a cyanide group (-CN) and a hydrogen atom across the C=O double bond.
*   **Analyze the mechanism:**
    1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.
    2.  This attack forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate (`CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃`).
    3.  This negatively charged intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.
*   **Determine Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate.
    *   Looking at the options for A, we have `H₃O⁺` and `NaHSO₃`.
    *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄). It is an excellent proton source and is required for this protonation step.
    *   `NaHSO₃` (sodium bisulfite) is a different reagent that also adds to carbonyls but forms a bisulfite addition product, not a cyanohydrin.
    *   Therefore, **A must be H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options C and D.

**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**
*   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`
*   **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis of a nitrile.
*   **Analyze the mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis requires vigorous conditions, typically heating with a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water.
*   **Determine Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis. We are left with options A and B, so the choices for B are `HCl` and `CH₃COOH`.
    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid. It is a standard and effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.
    *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to efficiently drive the hydrolysis to completion under typical conditions.
    *   Therefore, **B must be HCl**.

**Step 3: Combine the results and select the final answer.**
*   From Step 1, we determined that **A = H₃O⁺**.
*   From Step 2, we determined that **B = HCl**.
*   The correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.
*   This corresponds to option A.
