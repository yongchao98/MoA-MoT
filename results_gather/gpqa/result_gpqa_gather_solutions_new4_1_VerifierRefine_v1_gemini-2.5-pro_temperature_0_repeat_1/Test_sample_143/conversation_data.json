Understand the relationship between decay width and lifetime**\n\nThe lifetime (τ) of a particle in its rest frame is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ). This relationship is given by the formula:\nτ = ħ / Γ\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n**2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) and β**\n\nThe Lorentz factor (γ) is a measure of the time dilation and length contraction effects for an object moving at relativistic speeds. It is calculated as the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (mc²).\n\nGiven:\n*   Production energy E_X = 8 GeV\n*   Mass m_X = 1.2 GeV/c²\n\nγ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.67\n\nThe factor β is the ratio of the particle's speed to the speed of light (v/c). It can be calculated from the Lorentz factor:\nβ = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400) ≈ 0.9887\n\n**3. Calculate the mean decay distance (L)**\n\nThe mean decay distance is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays. Due to time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. The distance is this lifetime multiplied by the particle's velocity (v = βc).\n\nL = v * (γτ) = (βc) * γ * τ = βγcτ\n\nWe can combine the steps using the relationship L = βγ * (ħc / Γ).\n\n**4.

Understand the concepts**\n\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (L):** This is the average distance a particle travels before it decays. For a relativistic particle, this distance is affected by time dilation. The formula is `L = γ * β * c * τ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `β` is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light `c`, and `τ` is the particle's proper lifetime (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n*   **Proper Lifetime (τ) and Decay Width (Γ):** The lifetime of an unstable particle is inversely related to its decay width. The decay width represents the uncertainty in the particle's mass-energy and is related to the lifetime through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is `τ = ħ / Γ`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n**2. Identify the given values**\n\n*   Production energy, E_X = 8 GeV\n*   Mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV/c²\n*   Decay width, Γ_X = 320 MeV\n\n**3.

Step-by-step calculation**\n\n**Step A: Calculate the proper lifetime (τ) of the X meson.**\n\nUsing the relationship between lifetime and decay width:\nτ = ħ / Γ_X\nτ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / (320 MeV)\nτ ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n**Step B: Calculate the relativistic factor (γβ).**\n\nThe term `γβ` can be calculated from the particle's energy and mass. The total energy `E` is related to momentum `p` and mass `m` by the equation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The term `γβ` is equal to `p/m` (or `pc/mc²`).\n\nFirst, find the momentum `p`:\n(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²\n(pc)² = (8 GeV)² - (1.2 GeV)²\n(pc)² = 64 GeV² - 1.44 GeV²\n(pc)² = 62.56 GeV²\npc = √62.56 GeV ≈ 7.909 GeV\n\nNow, calculate `γβ`:\nγβ = pc / mc²\nγβ = 7.909 GeV / 1.2 GeV\nγβ ≈ 6.591\n\n**Step C: Calculate the mean decay distance (L).**\n\nNow, use the formula for the mean decay distance:\nL = γβ * c * τ\nL ≈ 6.591 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\nL ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\n**Alternative Calculation using ħc:**\n\nA more direct way combines these steps:\nL = γβ * c * τ = (pc / mc²) * c * (ħ / Γ) = (pc / mc²) * (ħc / Γ)\n\nL = (7.909 GeV / 1.2 GeV) * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\nNote: 1 GeV = 1000 MeV\nL ≈ 6.591 * (197.3 / 320) fm\nL ≈ 6.591 * 0.6166 fm\nL ≈ 4.0655 fm\n\nSince 1 femtometer (fm) is equal to 10⁻¹⁵ meters, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated mean decay distance matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X.\n\n### 1. Understand the Concepts\n\nThe mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is the product of its velocity ($v$) and its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau'$).\n\n$L = v \\cdot \\tau'$\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau'$) is related to the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau$, its lifetime in its own rest frame) by time dilation:\n\n$\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe proper lifetime ($\\tau$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n\n$\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nCombining these, the mean decay distance is:\n\n$L = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau) = (\\beta c) \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = \\beta \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nwhere $\\beta = v/c$ and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Necessary Quantities\n\nWe are given:\n*   Total energy, $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Rest mass energy, $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Decay width, $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV} = 0.320 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nWe will use the physical constant:\n*   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$)\n\n**a) Calculate the term $\\beta \\gamma$**\n\nThe term $\\beta \\gamma$ can be calculated from the particle's energy and mass. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is:\n$E_X^2 = (p_X c)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$\n\nFrom this, we can find the momentum $p_X$:\n$(p_X c)^2 = E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2 = (8 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\text{ GeV})^2$\n$(p_X c)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n$p_X c = \\sqrt{62.56} \\text{ GeV} \\approx 7.9095 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThe momentum is also given by $p_X = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X (\\beta c)$. Therefore:\n$p_X c = \\beta \\gamma (m_X c^2)$\n\nNow we can solve for $\\beta \\gamma$:\n$\\beta \\gamma = \\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56} \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 6.5912$\n\n### 3. Calculate the Mean Decay Distance\n\nNow we can plug all the values into the formula for the mean decay distance $L$:\n\n$L = (\\beta \\gamma) \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n$L \\approx (6.5912) \\cdot \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n\n$L \\approx 6.5912 \\cdot (0.61665 \\text{ fm})$\n\n$L \\approx 4.0655 \\text{ fm}$\n\n### 4. Convert to Meters\n\nSince $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$, the mean decay distance in meters is:\n\n$L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Given Information\nThe objective is to calculate the **mean decay distance ($L$)** of a particle in the laboratory frame. This is the average distance the particle travels before it decays.\n\nThe given quantities are:\n*   Total energy of the particle X: $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Rest mass of the particle X: $m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$ (This implies the rest energy is $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$)\n*   Decay width of the particle X: $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### Step 2: Identify Necessary Physical Concepts and Formulas\n1.  **Proper Mean Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame is called the proper lifetime. It is inversely related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab frame. The lab-frame lifetime ($t_{lab}$) is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau$) by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n    $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance ($L$):** The distance the particle travels in the lab frame is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime ($t_{lab}$):\n    $L = v \\cdot t_{lab} = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau$\n\n4.  **Relativistic Kinematics:**\n    *   The velocity is often expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $v = \\beta c$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$.\n    *   The formula for the decay distance can be written as $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$.\n    *   A more direct calculation can be done using the relativistic momentum ($p_X$). The energy-momentum relation is $E_X^2 = (p_X c)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$.\n    *   The term $\\gamma \\beta$ can be expressed as $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}$.\n    *   Substituting these into the formula for $L$, we get:\n        $L = \\left(\\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}\\right) c \\tau = \\left(\\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}\\right) c \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}\\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n        This final formula is very convenient as it uses the given energy/mass values directly and the well-known constant $\\hbar c$.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation\n**Careful Point:** Ensure all units are consistent.

Let's review the process.\n\n**1. Recap of the Physics and Formula**\n\nThe mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle in the laboratory frame is given by the product of its velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{lab}$).\n$L = v \\cdot t_{lab}$\n\nDue to time dilation, the lab-frame lifetime is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau$) by the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n$t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\nThe proper lifetime $\\tau$ is related to the decay width $\\Gamma$ by the uncertainty principle:\n$\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nCombining these, and using $v = \\beta c$, we get:\n$L = (\\beta c) (\\gamma \\tau) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\nThe term $\\gamma \\beta$ can be expressed in terms of the particle's energy ($E$) and mass ($m$). From the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$ and the definition of relativistic momentum $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$, we can write:\n$\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{p}{m} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $L$:\n$L = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} \\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n**2. Plugging in the Values**\n\nWe are given:\n*   $E_X = 8$ GeV\n*   $m_X = 1.2$ GeV (Note: this is shorthand for $m_X c^2 = 1.2$ GeV)\n*   $\\Gamma_X = 320$ MeV = $0.320$ GeV\n*   The physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327$ MeV·fm = $0.197327$ GeV·fm.

Option B, $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m, is the closest match.

This relationship is given by the formula:\nτ = ħ / Γ\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n**2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) and β**\n\nThe Lorentz factor (γ) is a measure of the time dilation and length contraction effects for an object moving at relativistic speeds. It is calculated as the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (mc²).\n\nGiven:\n*   Production energy E_X = 8 GeV\n*   Mass m_X = 1.2 GeV/c²\n\nγ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.67\n\nThe factor β is the ratio of the particle's speed to the speed of light (v/c). It can be calculated from the Lorentz factor:\nβ = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400) ≈ 0.9887\n\n**3.

Understand the concepts**\n\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (L):** This is the average distance a particle travels before it decays. For a relativistic particle, this distance is affected by time dilation. The formula is `L = γ * β * c * τ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `β` is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light `c`, and `τ` is the particle's proper lifetime (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n*   **Proper Lifetime (τ) and Decay Width (Γ):** The lifetime of an unstable particle is inversely related to its decay width. The decay width represents the uncertainty in the particle's mass-energy and is related to the lifetime through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is `τ = ħ / Γ`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n**2. Identify the given values**\n\n*   Production energy, E_X = 8 GeV\n*   Mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV/c²\n*   Decay width, Γ_X = 320 MeV\n\n**3. List the necessary constants**\n\n*   **Reduced Planck constant (ħ):** Approximately 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s.\n*   **Speed of light (c):** Approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s.\n*   A useful combination is **ħc**, which is approximately 197.3 MeV·fm (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m).\n\n**4. Step-by-step calculation**\n\n**Step A: Calculate the proper lifetime (τ) of the X meson.**\n\nUsing the relationship between lifetime and decay width:\nτ = ħ / Γ_X\nτ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / (320 MeV)\nτ ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n**Step B: Calculate the relativistic factor (γβ).**\n\nThe term `γβ` can be calculated from the particle's energy and mass. The total energy `E` is related to momentum `p` and mass `m` by the equation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The term `γβ` is equal to `p/m` (or `pc/mc²`).\n\nFirst, find the momentum `p`:\n(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²\n(pc)² = (8 GeV)² - (1.2 GeV)²\n(pc)² = 64 GeV² - 1.44 GeV²\n(pc)² = 62.56 GeV²\npc = √62.56 GeV ≈ 7.909 GeV\n\nNow, calculate `γβ`:\nγβ = pc / mc²\nγβ = 7.909 GeV / 1.2 GeV\nγβ ≈ 6.591\n\n**Step C: Calculate the mean decay distance (L).**\n\nNow, use the formula for the mean decay distance:\nL = γβ * c * τ\nL ≈ 6.591 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\nL ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\n**Alternative Calculation using ħc:**\n\nA more direct way combines these steps:\nL = γβ * c * τ = (pc / mc²) * c * (ħ / Γ) = (pc / mc²) * (ħc / Γ)\n\nL = (7.909 GeV / 1.2 GeV) * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\nNote: 1 GeV = 1000 MeV\nL ≈ 6.591 * (197.3 / 320) fm\nL ≈ 6.591 * 0.6166 fm\nL ≈ 4.0655 fm\n\nSince 1 femtometer (fm) is equal to 10⁻¹⁵ meters, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated mean decay distance matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X.\n\n### 1. Understand the Concepts\n\nThe mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is the product of its velocity ($v$) and its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau'$).\n\n$L = v \\cdot \\tau'$\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau'$) is related to the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau$, its lifetime in its own rest frame) by time dilation:\n\n$\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe proper lifetime ($\\tau$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n\n$\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nCombining these, the mean decay distance is:\n\n$L = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau) = (\\beta c) \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = \\beta \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nwhere $\\beta = v/c$ and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Necessary Quantities\n\nWe are given:\n*   Total energy, $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Rest mass energy, $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Decay width, $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV} = 0.320 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nWe will use the physical constant:\n*   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$)\n\n**a) Calculate the term $\\beta \\gamma$**\n\nThe term $\\beta \\gamma$ can be calculated from the particle's energy and mass. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is:\n$E_X^2 = (p_X c)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$\n\nFrom this, we can find the momentum $p_X$:\n$(p_X c)^2 = E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2 = (8 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\text{ GeV})^2$\n$(p_X c)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n$p_X c = \\sqrt{62.56} \\text{ GeV} \\approx 7.9095 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThe momentum is also given by $p_X = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X (\\beta c)$. Therefore:\n$p_X c = \\beta \\gamma (m_X c^2)$\n\nNow we can solve for $\\beta \\gamma$:\n$\\beta \\gamma = \\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56} \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 6.5912$\n\n### 3. Calculate the Mean Decay Distance\n\nNow we can plug all the values into the formula for the mean decay distance $L$:\n\n$L = (\\beta \\gamma) \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n$L \\approx (6.5912) \\cdot \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n\n$L \\approx 6.5912 \\cdot (0.61665 \\text{ fm})$\n\n$L \\approx 4.0655 \\text{ fm}$\n\n### 4. Convert to Meters\n\nSince $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$, the mean decay distance in meters is:\n\n$L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Given Information\nThe objective is to calculate the **mean decay distance ($L$)** of a particle in the laboratory frame. This is the average distance the particle travels before it decays.\n\nThe given quantities are:\n*   Total energy of the particle X: $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Rest mass of the particle X: $m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$ (This implies the rest energy is $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$)\n*   Decay width of the particle X: $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### Step 2: Identify Necessary Physical Concepts and Formulas\n1.  **Proper Mean Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame is called the proper lifetime. It is inversely related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab frame. The lab-frame lifetime ($t_{lab}$) is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau$) by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n    $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance ($L$):** The distance the particle travels in the lab frame is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime ($t_{lab}$):\n    $L = v \\cdot t_{lab} = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau$\n\n4.  **Relativistic Kinematics:**\n    *   The velocity is often expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $v = \\beta c$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$.\n    *   The formula for the decay distance can be written as $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$.\n    *   A more direct calculation can be done using the relativistic momentum ($p_X$). The energy-momentum relation is $E_X^2 = (p_X c)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$.\n    *   The term $\\gamma \\beta$ can be expressed as $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}$.\n    *   Substituting these into the formula for $L$, we get:\n        $L = \\left(\\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}\\right) c \\tau = \\left(\\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}\\right) c \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}\\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n        This final formula is very convenient as it uses the given energy/mass values directly and the well-known constant $\\hbar c$.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation\n**Careful Point:** Ensure all units are consistent.

Understand the Goal and Physical Principles**\n\nThe goal is to find the mean decay distance ($L$) of a relativistic particle (meson X) in the laboratory frame. This requires combining concepts from special relativity and particle physics.\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame is determined by its decay width ($\\Gamma$) via the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab. This lab-frame lifetime ($t_{lab}$) is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n    $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\n*   **Mean Decay Distance ($L$):** The distance is the particle's velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime. The velocity is often written as $v = \\beta c$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n    $L = v \\cdot t_{lab} = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$\n\n*   **Combined Formula:** A very convenient formula for calculation combines these steps:\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n**2. List Given Values and Constants**\n\n*   Total Energy: $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Rest Mass Energy: $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Decay Width: $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV} = 0.320 \\text{ GeV}$ (It's crucial to convert to consistent units, here GeV).\n*   Physical Constant: $\\hbar c \\approx 197.3 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm} = 0.1973 \\text{ GeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$.\n*   Unit Conversion: $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 3a: Calculate the relativistic factor $\\gamma \\beta$.**\nThis term can be found directly from the particle's energy and mass without calculating $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ individually.\nFrom the energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, we can find the momentum term $pc$:\n$(pc)^2 = E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2 = (8 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\text{ GeV})^2$\n$(pc)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n$pc = \\sqrt{62.56} \\text{ GeV} \\approx 7.9095 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThe momentum is also defined as $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$, so $pc = \\gamma \\beta (mc^2)$.\nTherefore, we can find $\\gamma \\beta$:\n$\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56} \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 6.5912$\n\n**Step 3b: Calculate the mean decay distance $L$.**\nNow, we use the combined formula:\n$L = (\\gamma \\beta) \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$L \\approx (6.5912) \\cdot \\frac{0.1973 \\text{ GeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{0.320 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\nThe GeV units cancel out, leaving the answer in femtometers (fm).\n$L \\approx 6.5912 \\times \\left(\\frac{0.1973}{0.320}\\right) \\text{ fm}$\n$L \\approx 6.5912 \\times 0.61656 \\text{ fm}$\n$L \\approx 4.0655 \\text{ fm}$\n\n**Step 3c: Convert the result to meters.**\nSince $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$:\n$L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\n**4. Compare with Options and Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated value is $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nB) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nThe calculated value matches option D exactly.\n\n**Careful Points and Analysis of Other Agents:**\n*   **Unit Consistency:** It is essential to convert the decay width from MeV to GeV to match the units of energy and mass.\n*   **Correct Formula:** The full relativistic formula $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$ must be used.\n*   **Calculation of $\\gamma \\beta$:** The most robust way to calculate $\\gamma \\beta$ is via the momentum, as shown above. Calculating $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ separately can introduce more rounding steps.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** Almost all candidate answers arrive at the correct numerical value. The discrepancies in the final letter choice (e.g., some choosing A, B, or C) are due to those agents being presented with a scrambled list of options. The agents who had the same option list as the prompt consistently and correctly chose D.\n\nThe physics and the calculation are sound and point unambiguously to one answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\nChecker feedback:\noutput: Correct\n"
