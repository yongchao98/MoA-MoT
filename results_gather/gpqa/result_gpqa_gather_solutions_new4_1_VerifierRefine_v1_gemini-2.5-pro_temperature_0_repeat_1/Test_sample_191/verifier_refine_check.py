    2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor shields the exterior from the fields of the charges inside the cavity. The external field is due ONLY to the charge on the outer surface.
    3.  **Symmetry and Shell Theorem:** The +q on the outer spherical surface distributes uniformly. The field outside this uniform spherical shell is the same as a point charge +q at its center.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.

**1. Analyze the Initial State and Charge Induction:**
*   The system starts with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero.
*   A positive point charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.
*   This `+q` charge attracts the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.
*   To find the total induced charge on the inner surface, we use Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material, enclosing the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor is zero. Therefore, the net electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero, which implies the total enclosed charge must be zero.
*   The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge `+q` and the charge on the inner surface, `q_inner`. So, `q + q_inner = 0`, which means `q_inner = -q`.

**2. Determine the Charge on the Outer Surface:**
*   The conductor was initially neutral. Charge conservation requires that the total charge of the conductor remains zero.
*   The total charge of the conductor is the sum of the charge on its inner and outer surfaces: `q_inner + q_outer = 0`.
*   Substituting `q_inner = -q`, we get `-q + q_outer = 0`.
*   This means a charge of `q_outer = +q` must reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.

**3. Apply the Principle of Electrostatic Shielding:**
*   A fundamental property of conductors is that they act as an electrostatic shield (a Faraday cage).
*   The electric field at any point outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields from all charges. However, the shielding effect means that the combined electric field from the charge inside the cavity (`+q`) and the induced charge on the inner surface (`-q`) is exactly zero for all points outside the cavity.
*   Therefore, the electric field at point P (which is outside the conductor) is produced *only* by the charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.

**4. Analyze the Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:**
*   We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface.
*   The outer surface is a sphere of radius `R`.
*   Because the conducting material shields the outer surface from the asymmetric arrangement of charges inside, and there are no other external fields, this `+q` charge will distribute itself *uniformly* over the outer spherical surface.

**5. Calculate the Electric Field at Point P:**
*   The problem is now reduced to finding the electric field from a uniformly charged spherical shell of total charge `+q`.
*   According to the Shell Theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.
*   The total charge is `+q`.
*   The center of the sphere is the center of the conductor.
*   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the conductor.
*   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law:
    $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$

**6. Conclusion and Evaluation of Options:**
*   The derived formula is $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$.
*   The parameters `r`, `s`, `l`, and `Î¸` describe the internal geometry, which is made irrelevant by the electrostatic shielding of the conductor. They are distractors.
*   Comparing the result with the given options:
    A) $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$
    B) $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{l^2}$
    C) $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{(l-s \cos\theta)^2}$
    D) $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{(l+s \cos\theta)^2}$
*   The correct formula matches option A.

The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most of them correctly apply the physical principles, there are frequent errors in matching the derived formula to the correct option letter. The consensus on the physics is clear and points to the formula in option A.
