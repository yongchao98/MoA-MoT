    # This is an aldol addition product of two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
    #
    # Overall Strategy:
    # 1. Convert ethynylcyclohexane -> cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
    #    - This requires adding one carbon and then cleaving the chain.
    # 2. Perform a self-aldol addition on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
