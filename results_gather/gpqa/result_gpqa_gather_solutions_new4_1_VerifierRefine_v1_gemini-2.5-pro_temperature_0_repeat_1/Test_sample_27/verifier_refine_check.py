    Checks the correctness of the provided LLM answer for a multi-step synthesis problem.

    The function verifies the answer by applying key chemical principles for each reaction step:
    1.  **Step 2 (Tandem Addition/Alkylation):** Checks the stereochemistry resulting from the anti-addition of the phenyl group and the subsequent anti-addition of the benzyl group.
    2.  **Step 3 (Methylation):** Checks the regiochemistry (position of methylation) based on kinetic enolate formation with LDA and the resulting stereochemistry.
    3.  **Final Structure:** Compares the derived structure and stereochemistry against the properties of the selected option.
