def check_correctness_of_exoplanet_period_ratio():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the exoplanet orbital period problem.

    The solution relies on two key physical principles:
    1. The relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and its orbital distance (a):
       For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).
       Therefore, a is proportional to T_eq^(-2).
    2. Kepler's Third Law, which relates orbital period (P) to orbital distance (a):
       P^2 is proportional to a^3, which means P is proportional to a^(3/2).

    By combining these, we can find a direct relationship between period and temperature:
    P is proportional to (T_eq^(-2))^(3/2), which simplifies to P is proportional to T_eq^(-3).
    This means the ratio of periods P3/P1 is equal to (T1/T3)^3.
