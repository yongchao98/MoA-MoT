    # --- Correctness Check ---

    # Part 1: Determine the correct identity of reactant A.
    # The reaction is a [2+2] cycloaddition between cyclohexene and a ketene.
    # The product, 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one, is formed from a 6-membered ring (cyclohexene)
    # and a 4-membered ring. The new ring has a ketone (=O) at position 7 and a diiodo (-I2) group at position 8.
    # This requires the other reactant (A) to be diiodoketene, with the structure I2C=C=O.
    # The correct IUPAC name for I2C=C=O is "2,2-diiodoethen-1-one".
    correct_reactant_A = "2,2-diiodoethen-1-one"

    # Part 2: Determine the correct reactivity order for dienes B.
    # The reactivity of dienes in a Diels-Alder reaction depends on their ability to adopt the s-cis conformation and electronic effects.
    # 1. cyclopenta-1,3-diene (3): Locked in the reactive s-cis conformation. It is the most reactive.
    # 2. 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene (1): Has two internal electron-donating groups (EDGs) and can easily adopt the s-cis form. It is very reactive.
    # 3. (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene (2): Has two terminal EDGs. It is less reactive than (1) due to less effective electronic activation and a slight preference for the s-trans conformation.
    # 4. (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene (4): Severe steric hindrance between the methyl groups prevents it from adopting the required s-cis conformation. It is the least reactive.
    # Therefore, the correct order from most to least reactive is 3 > 1 > 2 > 4.
