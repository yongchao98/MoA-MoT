    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the careful points from the provided answers.

    **Step 1: Analyze Reaction A**
    *   **Reaction:** `dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)`
    *   **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**
        *   The Michael donor is the nucleophile formed from dimethyl malonate. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), is strong enough to deprotonate the highly acidic α-carbon (the one between the two ester groups), forming a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.
        *   The Michael acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.
    *   **Determine Product Structure (A):**
        *   The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.
        *   The resulting enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent, ethanol (EtOH), at the α-carbon.
        *   The final product structure is `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.
    *   **Name Product (A):**
        *   To name this compound according to the options, we consider a propane backbone formed by the malonate carbon and the α and β carbons of the acrylate.
        *   The structure can be written as `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.
        *   Numbering this propane chain, we have two methoxycarbonyl groups at C1, a p-tolyl group at C2, and a methoxycarbonyl group at C3.
        *   The correct IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.

    **Step 2: Analyze Reaction B**
    *   **Reaction:** `1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)`
    *   **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**
        *   The Michael donor is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which acts as a nucleophilic equivalent of the enolate of cyclohexanone. The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the original ketone.
        *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.
    *   **Determine Product Structure (B):**
        *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium ion back to a ketone.
        *   The reaction adds a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group to the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone ring.
        *   The major final product is the thermodynamically more stable keto tautomer, not the enol form.
    *   **Name Product (B):**
        *   The principal functional group is the nitrile, so the parent chain is butanenitrile.
        *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain. The substituent is named `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.
        *   The correct IUPAC name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.

    **Step 3: Analyze Reaction C**
    *   **Reaction:** `C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`
    *   **Identify Reactant C (Retrosynthesis):**
        *   The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.
        *   The Michael acceptor is but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).
        *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of the acceptor. After protonation, the MVK molecule becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` group, which is the `(3-oxobutyl)` group seen in the product.
        *   This group is attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. This means the C2 carbon of the dione was the nucleophile.
        *   The protons at the C2 position of a 1,3-dione are highly acidic and are readily removed by a base like KOH to form the nucleophilic enolate.
        *   Therefore, the reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The alternative, `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`, is not the correct representation of the starting diketone.

    **Step 4: Final Conclusion**
    Based on the step-by-step analysis:
    *   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate
    *   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile
    *   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione

    Now, we compare this set of correct answers with the given options:
    *   A) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect)
    *   B) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)
    *   C) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Correct)
    *   D) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect)

    Option C is the only one that correctly identifies all three components.
