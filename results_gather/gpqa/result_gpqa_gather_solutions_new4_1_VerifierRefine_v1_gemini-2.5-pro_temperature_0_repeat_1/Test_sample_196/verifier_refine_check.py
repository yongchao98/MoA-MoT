    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.

    ### **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X.**

    This step involves a careful interpretation of the provided spectroscopic data (IR and ¹H NMR).

    *   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**
        *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is a highly characteristic absorption for the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).
        *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region and is typical for the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.
        *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are characteristic of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic (benzene) ring.
        *   **Conclusion from IR:** The data strongly suggests that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.

    *   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**
        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet this far downfield is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**), confirming the IR analysis.
        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **para (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded because they are adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The protons at 7.2 ppm are adjacent to the other substituent.
        *   **Analysis of the Alkyl Group:** The remaining signals must describe the second substituent on the ring.
            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is part of an ethyl fragment.
            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).
            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-).
            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift suggests it is benzylic (directly attached to the benzene ring).
        *   **Assembling the Structure:** The benzylic methine (-CH-) is attached to the ring. It is also attached to a methyl group (from the 1.4 ppm doublet) and an ethyl group (from the 0.9 ppm triplet and 1.7 ppm multiplet). This forms a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).

    *   **Conclusion for Compound X:** Combining all the evidence, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

    ### **Step 2: Analyze the chemical reaction.**

    *   **Reagents:** Compound X is reacted with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).
    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. Its specific function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).
    *   **Careful Points:**
        *   The reaction is specific to the carboxylic acid group. The aromatic ring and the stable sec-butyl alkyl chain are not affected under these conditions.
        *   Rearrangement of the sec-butyl group is not expected as a major product pathway.
        *   The identity of Compound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is option D. This is a common distracter; the question asks for the *final product* of the reaction, not the identity of the starting material.

    ### **Step 3: Predict the final product.**

    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
    *   **Transformation:** The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.
    *   **Final Product:** The product is a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in a para (1,4) relationship. The name is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

    ### **Step 4: Match the final product with the given options.**

    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.
    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - **This matches the predicted final product.**
    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not the isomeric isobutyl group.
    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material, Compound X.

    The final answer is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.
