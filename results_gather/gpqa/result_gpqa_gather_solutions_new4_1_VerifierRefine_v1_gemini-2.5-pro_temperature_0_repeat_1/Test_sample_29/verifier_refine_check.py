    Checks the correctness of the answer for the textile dye problem.

    The function verifies the following steps:
    1. Calculation of the emitted light's wavelength from the given energy.
    2. Identification of the emitted light's color based on its wavelength.
    3. Application of the Stokes Shift principle (absorbed light has a shorter
       wavelength than emitted light).
    4. Evaluation of the chosen answer against this principle and plausibility.
