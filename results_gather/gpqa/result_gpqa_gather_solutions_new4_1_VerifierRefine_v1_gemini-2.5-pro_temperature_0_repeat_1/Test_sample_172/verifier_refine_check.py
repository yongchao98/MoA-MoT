    Checks the correctness of the answer to the physics problem.

    The problem asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) given:
    - Uncertainty in position, Δx = 0.1 nm
    - Speed of the electron, v = 2 * 10^8 m/s

    The solution involves:
    1. Calculating Δp from Heisenberg's principle: Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)
    2. Calculating ΔE from the energy-momentum relation: ΔE ≈ v * Δp
