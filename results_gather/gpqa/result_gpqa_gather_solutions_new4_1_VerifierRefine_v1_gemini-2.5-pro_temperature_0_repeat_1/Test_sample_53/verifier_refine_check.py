    # --- Step 2: Retrosynthetic Analysis ---
    # The product name "5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene" implies the lowest
    # possible locant set for substituents is {3, 4, 5}.
    # For an RCM reaction of an octa-1,7-diene, this product naming is achieved
    # only when the precursor's substituents are also at positions 3, 4, and 5.

    # Based on the required substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 on an
    # octa-1,7-diene backbone, we can construct the IUPAC name.
    # Substituents are listed alphabetically: 'isopropyl' before 'methyl'.
