    The core principle is:
    In 4D spacetime, each loop (L) contributes a factor of 1/(4π)^2.
    Therefore, an L-loop diagram has a factor of (1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L).
    The expression has a factor of 1/(4π)^6.
    So, we must solve 2L = 6.

**Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem**

1.  **Deconstruct the Expression:** The given expression is `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`. To solve the problem, we must understand the physical significance of each term in the context of a quantum field theory calculation.
    *   `alpha^3 * g^2`: These are powers of coupling constants. They relate to the number of interaction vertices in the Feynman diagram.
    *   `sqrt(2) * 8`: These are dimensionless numerical factors that arise from symmetry, group theory, or algebraic traces.
    *   `(Q/M)^2`: This is a ratio of energy scales, a typical result of evaluating the momentum integrals.
    *   `1/(4pi)^6`: This is the most important term for this problem. It is a characteristic factor that arises from loop integrations.

2.  **Identify the Loop Factor Rule:** In quantum field theory calculations performed in four-dimensional spacetime (as specified in the problem), each loop in a Feynman diagram involves an integration over an unconstrained internal momentum. The standard technique for evaluating these integrals (dimensional regularization) shows that each loop systematically contributes a factor of `1/(4π)^2` to the final amplitude.

3.  **Formulate the Equation:**
    *   Let `L` be the number of loops in the diagram.
    *   Based on the rule from Step 2, the total factor from `L` loops will be `(1/(4π)^2)^L`, which simplifies to `1/(4π)^(2L)`.
    *   The expression from the note contains the factor `1/(4pi)^6`.
    *   We can equate the general formula with the specific factor found in the note: `1/(4π)^(2L) = 1/(4pi)^6`.

4.  **Solve for the Number of Loops (L):** For the equation to be true, the exponents must be equal:
    `2L = 6`
    Solving for `L`, we get:
    `L = 6 / 2 = 3`

**Careful Points and Consistency Check**

*   The most direct and unambiguous way to determine the loop order from such an expression is by analyzing the power of the `(4π)` factor.
*   The other terms are consistent with a 3-loop diagram. For example, the coupling term `alpha^3 * g^2` implies there are `3 + 2 = 5` vertices in the diagram. A 3-loop diagram with 5 vertices is a valid topological structure in quantum field theory.
*   The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while almost all of them correctly deduce that `L=3`, many of them select the wrong multiple-choice option. The correct reasoning must be paired with the correct final answer. The number of loops is 3, which corresponds to option D.

**Final Conclusion**

The factor `1/(4pi)^6` is the definitive clue. Since each loop contributes a factor of `1/(4pi)^2`, a factor of `(1/(4pi)^2)^3` implies the diagram must have contained 3 loops.
