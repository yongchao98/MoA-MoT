    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the exoplanet temperature ratio question.
    
    The physics principles are:
    1. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) is proportional to the inverse square root of the orbital distance (a): T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).
    2. Kepler's Third Law states that the orbital period squared (P^2) is proportional to the orbital distance cubed (a^3): P^2 ∝ a^3.
    3. Combining these gives T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3).
    4. Therefore, the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).
