def check_correctness_of_relativistic_energy_calculation():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the relativistic energy problem.
    It recalculates the energy based on the problem statement and compares it to the given options.
    
    The problem involves three main steps:
    1. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) for the given speed (0.96c).
    2. Calculate the rest energy (E0) of the nucleus (6Li).
    3. Calculate the total relativistic energy (E = gamma * E0).

    A key ambiguity in this problem is how to calculate the rest energy. There are two main methods:
    a) The precise method: Use the experimentally measured mass of the 6Li nucleus, which accounts for binding energy.
    b) The approximation method: Sum the rest energies of the constituent nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons), ignoring binding energy.

    This checker will perform both calculations to see which one aligns with the provided options, thereby verifying the logic used to arrive at the final answer.
