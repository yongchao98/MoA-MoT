Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and evaluate the proposed synthetic routes.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  Ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1: Strong activator, ortho-, para-director.\n    2.  tert-Butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃) at C2: Weak activator, ortho-, para-director.\n    3.  Nitro group (-NO₂) at C3: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n*   **Relationships:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO₂ are *meta* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO₂ are *ortho* to each other.\n\nThe meta relationship between the activating ethoxy group and the deactivating nitro group is a key challenge. This suggests that one of these groups was introduced when a meta-director was present on the ring, or a group's directing effect was changed during the synthesis (e.g., reducing -NO₂ to -NH₂).\n\nLet's evaluate each option step-by-step.\n\n**A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ; v) dilute H₂SO₄ ; vi) H₃O+, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n*   i) Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation)\n*   ii) tert-butylbenzene → o/p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n*   iii) Sulfonation of the nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n*   iv) NaNO₂/HCl is used for diazotization of a primary amine. At this stage, there is no amine group present. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vii) dilute H₂SO₄ ; viii) H₃O+, H₂O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃) on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vii) H₃O+, H₂O/Heat ; viii) dilute H₂SO₄ ix) NaOH/EtBr**\n*   This sequence attempts to use a sulfonic acid group as a blocking group to achieve ortho-nitration, which is a valid strategy.\n*   i) Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\n*   ii) tert-butylbenzene → p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   iii) Nitration gives 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   iv) Reduction of the nitro group gives 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   v) Diazotization of the amine.\n*   vi) Nitration of a diazonium salt is not a standard or logical reaction in this context. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O+, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ix) dilute H₂SO₄**\nLet's analyze the first seven steps of this sequence, as steps viii and ix (sulfonation/desulfonation) are nonsensical at the end of the synthesis and are likely distractors or an error in the question.\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an ortho-, para-director. This step produces a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para product is major due to sterics, so this is not a high-yield step for the ortho isomer. However, the ortho isomer is formed and can be separated. Let's proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In a strong acid like H₂SO₄, the amine is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The anilinium ion is a meta-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to the position meta to the -NH₃⁺ group, which is C3. This correctly installs the second nitro group to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n*   **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The primary amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt.\n*   **vi) H₃O+, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, replacing the -N₂⁺ group with an -OH group to give **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis. NaOH deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide attacks ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence (i-vii) is chemically sound and leads to the desired product. While step (ii) has yield limitations, the overall strategy correctly navigates the complex directing effects. The other options contain chemically impossible steps. Therefore, this is the only viable pathway among the choices.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAfter a thorough analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution directing effects and considering common multi-step synthesis strategies, a plausible high-yield pathway can be constructed. The key to this synthesis is controlling the regiochemistry, particularly the introduction of substituents at adjacent positions (1, 2, and 3), which is often challenging. The use of a blocking group is a classic strategy for such a challenge.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on a chemically sound reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** The synthesis should begin by adding the tert-butyl group to the benzene ring.\n    *   Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → tert-Butylbenzene.\n\n2.  **Blocking the Para Position:** The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. To force subsequent reactions to occur at the *ortho* position with high yield, the more accessible and electronically favored *para* position must be blocked. Sulfonation is ideal for this, as the sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) is large and can be removed later.\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + SO₃/H₂SO₄ → *p*-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n3.  **Nitration:** With the *para* position blocked, nitration will occur at the position *ortho* to the tert-butyl group. Both the tert-butyl group (*ortho, para*-directing) and the sulfonic acid group (*meta*-directing) direct the incoming nitro group to this same position.\n    *   *p*-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 2-Nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n4.  **Reduction of the Nitro Group:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, which is a versatile functional group for further transformations.\n    *   2-Nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n5.  **Diazotization and Introduction of the Nitro Group:** This is the most complex part of the synthesis and where the provided options are confusing. A logical path to the final product requires the synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** as a key intermediate. However, none of the options present a clear, standard method to achieve this. There seems to be a significant error in the reaction sequences provided in the options. For instance, option D, which starts correctly, lists nonsensical subsequent steps like nitrating a diazonium salt.\n\nLet's reconsider the intermediates and the final product structure: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. A crucial intermediate for this synthesis would be 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol, which could then be converted to the final product via Williamson ether synthesis.\n\nLet's re-examine the options to see if any could possibly lead to this intermediate, even with typos.\n\n*   **Option A:** Leads to 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene, an incorrect isomer.\n*   **Option B:** Fails at step (iii) because Friedel-Crafts alkylation does not work on aniline.\n*   **Option C:** The order of reactions is incorrect (e.g., diazotization before an amine is formed).\n*   **Option D:** Starts with the most logical and high-yield sequence (alkylation, sulfonation, nitration) to create an *ortho*-substituted product. However, the subsequent steps (iv-ix) are jumbled and chemically illogical as written. For example, reducing a nitro group (iv) only to diazotize it (v) and then attempt another nitration (vi) makes no sense.\n\nGiven the significant flaws in all the provided options, it's impossible to select one as a correct high-yield synthesis route. The question or the options are fundamentally flawed. However, if forced to choose the *best start* to a high-yield synthesis that correctly controls the initial regiochemistry, Option D's first three steps represent the most advanced and appropriate strategy for creating the necessary *ortho*-substituted intermediate. The rest of the sequence in option D is incorrect, but it is the only option that employs the necessary blocking group strategy for a high-yield synthesis of an *ortho*-substituted product from a *para*-directing starting material.\n\nSince a definitive correct answer cannot be derived from the flawed options, and based on the initial correct strategic steps, no option is fully correct. However, if this is a multiple-choice question from a source, there might be an intended answer despite the errors. Without a correct sequence provided, I cannot logically deduce the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step analysis of each option to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\nThis molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3-arrangement, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and competing directing effects.\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strong activator, ortho/para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weak activator, ortho/para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\ni) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene.** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\nii) **tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.** This is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an ortho/para director. Due to the large steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the para product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is the major product. The ortho product (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) is the minor product. To achieve the final 1,2,3-substitution pattern, we must proceed with the minor ortho isomer. This step already makes the synthesis not \"high-yield\", but let's continue.\niii) **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → 2-tert-butylaniline.** This is a standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\niv) **2-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.** This is the crucial step. Nitration of an aniline derivative under strongly acidic conditions (like HNO3/H2SO4) protonates the amino group to form an anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n    *   The anilinium ion (-NH3+) at C1 is a meta-director, directing incoming electrophiles to positions 3 and 5.\n    *   The tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2 is an ortho/para-director. The ortho positions relative to C2 are C1 (blocked) and C3. The para position is C5. So, the -tBu group also directs to positions 3 and 5.\n    *   Since both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (3 and 5), this reaction is feasible. It will produce a mixture of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline and 2-tert-butyl-5-nitroaniline. We need the 3-nitro isomer.\nv) **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenyldiazonium chloride.** This is the standard diazotization of a primary aromatic amine.\nvi) **Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group upon heating in aqueous acid.\nvii) **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to displace bromide from ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming the desired ether. This sequence successfully produces the target molecule.\nviii) & ix) **SO3/H2SO4 (Sulfonation)** and **dilute H2SO4 (Desulfonation).** These final two steps are redundant as the target molecule has already been formed. They are likely included as distractors or perhaps as a theoretical purification step, but they are not essential for the synthesis itself.\n\nDespite the low-yield steps, this sequence is chemically plausible and leads to the correct product.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) **Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.**\nii) **Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.**\niii) **Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → 3-tert-butylaniline.** Friedel-Crafts reactions on anilines are problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, converting it into a strongly deactivating, meta-directing -NH2-AlCl3 group. Thus, alkylation occurs at the meta position.\niv) **3-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → Mixture.** The -NH2 group (o,p-director) and -tBu group (o,p-director) would direct nitration to positions 4 and 6, not giving the required 1,2,3 pattern. This path does not lead to the target product.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene.**\nii) **tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** Sulfonation occurs preferentially at the para position due to sterics.\niii) **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** Both -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) direct to position 2.\niv) **+ Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** Reduction of the nitro group.\nv) **+ NaNO2/HCl → Diazotization.**\nvi) **+ HNO3/H2SO4 → ?** This step is chemically nonsensical. You do not nitrate a diazonium salt in this manner. The sequence is flawed.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene.**\nii) **tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.** (Major product).\niii) **+ SO3/H2SO4 → 2-sulfo-1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.** The ring is deactivated, but both groups direct to position 2.\niv) **+ NaNO2/HCl → ?** This is a diazotization reagent, but there is no primary amine group to react with. This sequence is chemically impossible as written.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the four options, only sequence A provides a chemically viable (though not necessarily high-yield) route to the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The other options contain chemically flawed steps or lead to incorrect isomers. The key to sequence A is the nitration of the 2-tert-butylanilinium ion, where the directing effects of the two substituents cooperate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's examine the substituents and their relative positions on the benzene ring:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)** at position 1. This is a strongly activating, *ortho, para*-directing group.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)** at position 2. This is a weakly activating, *ortho, para*-directing group. It is very bulky.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)** at position 3. This is a strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n\nThe key relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n\n**2. Develop a General Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis of polysubstituted benzenes requires careful consideration of the order of substitution and the directing effects of the groups.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The -OEt group is an ether. Ethers are commonly formed via the Williamson ether synthesis, which involves reacting an alkoxide with an alkyl halide. This suggests the final step is the reaction of a phenol with a base and an ethyl halide (e.g., NaOH/EtBr). This means the immediate precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **The Main Challenge:** The core of the problem is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol. Let's analyze its structure:\n    *   -OH at C1\n    *   -tBu at C2\n    *   -NO2 at C3\n    The -OH group (a strong *o,p*-director) is *meta* to the -NO2 group. This is a very difficult arrangement to achieve through direct electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) on a phenol, as the -OH group would direct nitration to the *ortho* (C2, C6) and *para* (C4) positions.\n\n*   **Plausible Strategy:** To overcome this directing group conflict, a more complex strategy involving blocking groups and/or the conversion of one functional group into another is necessary. The use of a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a temporary blocking group is a common and powerful technique. It can be introduced to block a reactive position (like the *para* position) and then removed later in the synthesis (desulfonation).\n\n**3. Analyze the Given Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on chemical principles.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    Step (ii) produces p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Step (iv) attempts to react this with NaNO2/HCl. This reagent is for the diazotization of primary aromatic amines (-NH2), not nitro compounds (-NO2). This sequence is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Step (v) creates a diazonium salt. Step (vi) attempts to sulfonate this diazonium salt using fuming sulfuric acid. Diazonium salts are generally unstable and would decompose under these harsh conditions. This step is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This sequence includes sulfonation (step viii) followed immediately by desulfonation (step ix). This is a redundant and pointless pair of steps. The sequence is illogical.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr`\n    Let's analyze this sequence carefully. It appears complex and contains a strange step, but let's trace the logic.\n    *   **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   **ii) Sulfonation → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** The bulky t-Bu group directs the incoming -SO3H group to the sterically accessible *para* position. This effectively \"blocks\" the para position.\n    *   **iii) Nitration → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** Now, nitration occurs. The -tBu group directs *ortho*, and the -SO3H group directs *meta*. Both direct to the same position (C2). This is a highly regioselective step.\n    *   **iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 4-tert-Butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    *   **v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) → Diazonium salt:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    *   **Steps vi, vii, viii:** This is the most complex part. The sequence as written has a problematic step (vi, nitrating a diazonium salt). However, it's highly likely there is a typo in the order of these steps. A chemically logical sequence would be to first convert the diazonium salt to a phenol, then nitrate, then desulfonate. Let's see if that works:\n        *   **Let's assume the intended order was (v) → (vii) → (vi) → (viii):**\n        *   **(vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        *   **(vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** Now, we nitrate this phenol. Let's analyze the directing effects:\n            *   -OH (at C2) is a strong *o,p*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n            *   -tBu (at C4) is an *o,p*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n            *   -SO3H (at C1) is a *m*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n            *   Remarkably, all three groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to positions C3 and C5. This would be a highly selective nitration. Let's assume substitution occurs at C3. The product is **3-nitro-4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        *   **(viii) dilute H2SO4:** This step causes desulfonation, removing the -SO3H group from C1. The resulting molecule has -OH at C2, -NO2 at C3, and -tBu at C4. Renaming this according to IUPAC rules (phenol is the parent), we get **3-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **Wait, this is an isomer of our target precursor!** The target precursor is 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. This means even with a logical reordering, sequence A does not produce the exact target molecule.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThere appears to be a flaw in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the steps of the correct option. However, when forced to choose the best option among the given choices:\n*   Options B, C, and D contain clear, fundamental chemical errors that make them invalid.\n*   Option A outlines a sophisticated and strategically sound plan: it uses a blocking group to control regiochemistry, followed by functional group interconversions. While it contains a questionable step (vi) as written, and even a logical reordering leads to an isomer, its overall framework is far superior to the other options. In the context of a multiple-choice question, one must select the \"most plausible\" or \"least incorrect\" pathway. The strategy employed in option A is the only one that demonstrates a correct approach to solving this type of complex synthesis problem.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the intended answer, despite its apparent flaws.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. The relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) are:\n*   **-OEt**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-directing. It is very bulky, which can hinder substitution at the ortho position.\n*   **-NO2**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with a bulky group like tert-butyl adjacent to two other substituents, is sterically hindered and challenging to achieve through direct substitution. This suggests a complex synthesis, possibly involving blocking groups or the modification of functional groups to alter their directing effects.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option. A common strategy in such problems is to identify any chemically nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Option B**: `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Step (v) is the diazotization of an amine formed in step (iv). Step (vi) involves reacting the resulting diazonium salt with a nitrating mixture (HNO3/H2SO4). This is not a standard or logical transformation for a diazonium salt. This option is likely incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C**: `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    Step (iii) is the sulfonation of p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The product is a sulfonic acid. Step (iv) attempts to perform a diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), but this reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2), which is not present. This sequence is chemically impossible. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D**: `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Similar to option B, this sequence involves reacting a diazonium salt (from step v) with fuming sulfuric acid (SO3/H2SO4). This is not a standard synthetic step for introducing a sulfonic acid group in this manner. This option is likely incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This option does not contain any fundamentally impossible reaction sequences. Each reagent is used in a context where a reaction can occur. Let's analyze the sequence in detail to see if it leads to the target product.\n\n**3. Detailed Analysis of Option A**\n\nLet's trace the reaction path for option A.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene**: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   Product: **tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene**: This is nitration. The -tBu group is *o,p*-directing, but due to its large steric bulk, the major product is the *para* isomer.\n    *   Major Product: **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene).\n\n*   **iii) Fe/HCl on p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**: This is the reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n    *   Product: **p-tert-butylaniline** (4-tert-butylaniline).\n\n*   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on p-tert-butylaniline**: This is the nitration of an aniline derivative. In strong acid (H2SO4), the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n    *   Substrate: 4-tert-butylanilinium ion. The -NH3+ is at C1 and -tBu is at C4.\n    *   The -NH3+ group directs nitration to the positions *meta* to it (C3 and C5).\n    *   The -tBu group directs to the positions *ortho* to it (C3 and C5).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C3 or C5).\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**: This is the diazotization of the primary amine.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt**: This is the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**: This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr).\n    *   Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt this point, we have synthesized an isomer of the target molecule. The target is 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene. Our product is 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene. The difference is the position of the tert-butyl group (C2 vs. C4).\n\n*   **viii) SO3/H2SO4 and ix) dilute H2SO4**: These final two steps are sulfonation followed by desulfonation. Under these acidic and heating conditions, reversible Friedel-Crafts alkylation can occur, leading to the migration of the tert-butyl group. The reaction mixture equilibrates towards the most thermodynamically stable isomer.\n    *   Let's compare the stability of the isomer we have (1-ethoxy-4-tBu-3-nitrobenzene) and the target isomer (1-ethoxy-2-tBu-3-nitrobenzene).\n    *   **Our isomer**: The tBu group is at C4, which is *para* to the activating -OEt group and *ortho* to the deactivating -NO2 group.\n    *   **Target isomer**: The tBu group is at C2, which is *ortho* to both the -OEt and -NO2 groups. This position is extremely sterically hindered.\n    *   The rearrangement from the C4 position to the highly crowded C2 position is thermodynamically unfavorable. Therefore, this sequence will not produce the target molecule in high yield.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the synthesis described in option A does not lead to the named target product via a straightforward thermodynamic argument, it is the only option that presents a chemically plausible sequence of reactions. Options B, C, and D contain steps that are nonsensical in standard organic synthesis (e.g., attempting diazotization without an amine, or reacting a diazonium salt with nitrating mixture). In the context of a multiple-choice question, one must select the \"best\" answer. Option A is the best choice because it is free from the fundamental flaws that invalidate the other options. It is likely that the question is flawed, either in the name of the target molecule or in the design of the synthetic pathway. However, based on eliminating the impossible options, A remains the only viable choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe substituents have the following directing effects for electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-OEt**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -tBu is *ortho* to -OEt.\n*   -NO2 is *meta* to -OEt.\n*   -NO2 is *ortho* to -tBu.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly and typically requires a multi-step synthesis involving blocking groups or functional group manipulations.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nWe will analyze each option step-by-step to see if it leads to the desired product. We will keep track of the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. For clarity, we'll initially number the substituents based on their order of introduction relative to the first substituent placed on the ring.\n\n---\n\n#### **Analysis of Option A**\n\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → tert-butylbenzene.**\n    *   This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. We now have a -tBu group on the ring. Let's place it at C1.\n    *   Intermediate: **tert-butylbenzene** (tBu at C1).\n\n*   **ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming -SO₃H group to the sterically less hindered *para* position (C4). The sulfonic acid group will serve as a blocking group.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, SO₃H at C4).\n\n*   **iii) 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is nitration. We have an *o,p*-director (-tBu at C1) and a *m*-director (-SO₃H at C4).\n    *   The -tBu group directs to C2 and C6 (ortho positions).\n    *   The -SO₃H group directs to C2 and C6 (meta positions).\n    *   Both groups direct the nitration to the same positions (C2/C6). The reaction proceeds cleanly.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, NO₂ at C2, SO₃H at C4). Note that the -tBu and -NO₂ groups are *ortho* to each other.\n\n*   **iv) ... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is the reduction of the nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   Intermediate: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, NH₂ at C2, SO₃H at C4).\n\n*   **v) ... + NaNO₂/HCl → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is the diazotization of the primary amine.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, N₂⁺ at C2, SO₃H at C4).\n\n*   **vi) ... + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is a second nitration. Let's analyze the directing effects on the diazonium salt intermediate.\n    *   -tBu at C1 is an *o,p*-director (directs to C6, as C2/C4 are substituted).\n    *   -N₂⁺ at C2 is a *m*-director (directs to C4/C6, C4 is substituted).\n    *   -SO₃H at C4 is a *m*-director (directs to C2/C6, C2 is substituted).\n    *   All three groups direct the incoming nitro group to C6. This is a highly specific reaction.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, N₂⁺ at C2, SO₃H at C4, NO₂ at C6).\n\n*   **vii) ... + H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol.**\n    *   This step involves two key transformations that occur upon heating in aqueous acid:\n        1.  **Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt**: The -N₂⁺ group at C2 is replaced by an -OH group.\n        2.  **Desulfonation**: The -SO₃H group at C4 is removed and replaced by -H.\n    *   The resulting molecule has: -tBu at C1, -OH at C2, and -NO₂ at C6.\n    *   Intermediate: **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **viii) ... + dilute H₂SO₄**\n    *   This step is likely redundant or ensures the completion of the previous step.\n\n*   **ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.**\n    *   This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol (-OH) is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether.\n    *   The -OH group on 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol is converted to an -OEt group.\n    *   Final Product has: -tBu at C1, -OEt at C2, -NO₂ at C6 (using the original numbering).\n    *   **Let's determine the IUPAC name of this final product.** The -OEt group has the highest priority for numbering, so its carbon is the new C1.\n        *   Original C2 (with -OEt) becomes New C1.\n        *   Numbering towards the next substituent gives the lowest locants: Original C1 (with -tBu) becomes New C2. Original C6 (with -NO₂) becomes New C3.\n        *   The locants are 1, 2, 3.\n        *   The name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   This matches the target molecule. Therefore, sequence A is a valid and high-yield pathway.\n\n---\n\n#### **Analysis of Other Options (Briefly)**\n\n*   **Option B & C:** Both start by nitrating tert-butylbenzene (step ii), which predominantly forms the *para* isomer (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene). Starting with a 1,4-disubstituted compound makes it very difficult to achieve the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern in a high-yield synthesis. Furthermore, step (iv) in option B (NaNO₂/HCl) is applied to an intermediate without an amino group, which is incorrect. Step (vii) in option C leads to an isomer of the target, not the target itself.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence starts with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, converting it into a deactivating, *meta*-directing group (-NH₂-AlCl₃). This would lead to *m*-tert-butylaniline, which does not have the required substitution pattern for subsequent steps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions described in Option A is the only one that correctly utilizes blocking groups and directing effects to systematically build the desired 1,2,3-substituted aromatic ring with high regioselectivity at each step.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   At position 1: an ethoxy group (-OEt).\n*   At position 2: a tert-butyl group (-tBu).\n*   At position 3: a nitro group (-NO2).\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The arrangement of these groups is crucial and often difficult to achieve via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) due to the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at its ortho positions.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Plausibility of the Final Steps (Retrosynthesis)**\n\n*   **Introducing -NO2 last:** The precursor would be 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxybenzene. The -OEt group (strong activator) would direct nitration to its para- (C4) and ortho- (C6) positions. The -tBu group would direct to its ortho- (C3, C5) positions. The powerful -OEt group would dominate, leading to nitration at C4 and C6, not C3. This route is unlikely to be high-yield.\n*   **Introducing -tBu last:** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Friedel-Crafts reactions are generally ineffective on strongly deactivated rings (due to the -NO2 group). Furthermore, the bulky t-butyl group would likely add at the less sterically hindered C4 or C6 positions, not the crowded C2 position.\n*   **Introducing -OEt last:** This is typically done via Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. The precursor would be **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. This seems like a plausible final step. The challenge is then to synthesize this specific phenol. Making this phenol with the 1,2,3-substitution pattern is non-trivial. For instance, nitrating 2-tert-butylphenol would lead to substitution at the 4- and 6-positions, not the 3-position.\n\nGiven the difficulty in devising a straightforward synthesis, we must carefully analyze the provided options. The correct answer must consist of a sequence of chemically valid reactions.\n\n**3. Analyze the Provided Options**\n\nLet's examine each option step-by-step.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene. (OK)\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration -> p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (major product). (OK)\n    iii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (OK)\n    iv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This is a diazotization reagent, which requires an amino group (-NH2). The substrate, a sulfonic acid, does not have an amino group. **This step is chemically incorrect.** Therefore, Option A is invalid.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene. (OK)\n    ii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction -> Aniline. (OK)\n    iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. (Problematic step)\n    ...\n    vi) `SO3/H2SO4`: This step follows a diazotization (v). Attempting to sulfonate a diazonium salt under these conditions is not a standard or logical reaction. **This step is chemically incorrect.** Therefore, Option B is invalid.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene. (OK)\n    ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation -> p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. (OK)\n    iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (OK)\n    iv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of -NO2 -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. (OK)\n    v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of -NH2 -> diazonium salt. (OK)\n    vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Attempting to nitrate a diazonium salt. **This step is chemically incorrect.** Therefore, Option C is invalid.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene. (OK)\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration -> p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (major product). (OK)\n    iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction -> p-tert-butylaniline. (OK)\n    iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. To avoid oxidation of the amino group and control the reaction, this step usually implies protection (e.g., acetylation to form N-acetyl-p-tert-butylaniline), followed by nitration, and then deprotection. The -NHAc group directs ortho, so the product is 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline. (Plausible sequence)\n    v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline -> diazonium salt. (OK)\n    vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol (Sandmeyer reaction) -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol. (OK)\n    vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis -> 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. (OK)\n    viii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of the resulting product. (A valid reaction)\n    ix) `dilute H2SO4`: Desulfonation. (A valid reaction)\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and C contain steps that are chemically nonsensical in the given context. Option D, in contrast, presents a sequence where every single step is a valid and well-known organic reaction.\n\nWhile the product of step (vii) in Option D is **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule, this sequence is the only chemically coherent one among the choices. The final two steps (viii and ix) are redundant as written, but they do not invalidate the sequence. It is highly probable that there is an error in the name of the target molecule in the question prompt.\n\nGiven the choices, the only sequence that represents a valid multi-step synthesis is Option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and the directing effects of the substituents to devise a logical synthetic pathway.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:** -OEt (ethoxy), -tBu (tert-butyl), -NO2 (nitro).\n*   **Positions:** They are on adjacent carbons (1, 2, and 3).\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho, para-directing.\n    *   -tBu: Activating, ortho, para-directing.\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n\nThe relative positions are key:\n*   -OEt (1) and -tBu (2) are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt (1) and -NO2 (3) are meta to each other.\n*   -tBu (2) and -NO2 (3) are ortho to each other.\n\nA meta relationship between the powerful activating group (-OEt) and the nitro group (-NO2) is unusual for a standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) nitration. This suggests a more complex strategy is needed, likely involving the manipulation of directing groups. Let's evaluate the given options.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Step (i) produces nitrobenzene, and step (ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair of the amino group, forming a strongly deactivated ring. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence starts by making tert-butylbenzene, then nitrating it.\n    *   Step (iv) attempts to form a diazonium salt (`NaNO2/HCl`), but the substrate at this point does not contain a primary aromatic amine group. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ; ix) NaOH/EtBr`\n    *   This sequence of reagents is chemically illogical. For instance, it prepares a diazonium salt in step (v), then attempts to nitrate it in step (vi) before hydrolyzing it in step (vii). This sequence is not viable as written.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    *   Let's trace the synthesis described by this sequence of reagents, assuming a logical reordering to make chemical sense, as the listed order is also problematic (e.g., sulfonation at the end). The key is the combination of reagents provided. A plausible synthesis using these reagents to achieve the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern is as follows:\n\n**Proposed Logical Synthesis based on Reagents in Option D (reordered):**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky tert-butyl group directs the incoming nitro group primarily to the sterically accessible para position.\n3.  **iii) 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl → 4-tert-butylaniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.\n4.  **iv) 4-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline:** This is a crucial step. The powerful activating amino group (-NH2) directs the incoming nitro group to its ortho position (C2). The tert-butyl group at C4 also directs to C2 (its meta position, but the amino group's ortho-directing effect dominates). While direct nitration of anilines can be complex, it is the necessary step to install the nitro group at the required position relative to the other groups.\n5.  **v) 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline + NaNO2/HCl → 2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium salt:** Diazotization of the primary amine.\n6.  **vi) 2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol:** The diazonium group is replaced with a hydroxyl group.\n7.  **vii) 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol + NaOH/EtBr → 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene:** Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether.\n\nThis sequence successfully uses the reagents from Option D (ignoring the final sulfonation/desulfonation steps which are unnecessary for this product) to produce an isomer, `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene`. However, none of the options, when interpreted literally or reordered logically, directly produce the target molecule `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` in high yield.\n\nThere appears to be a significant error in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the reaction sequences provided in the options. Given the choices, Option D outlines a sequence of reactions that is the most chemically plausible, despite leading to an isomeric product and having a confusing order. The key transformations (FC-alkylation, nitration, reduction, second nitration, diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) represent a valid, multi-step synthetic strategy. The other options contain more fundamental chemical impossibilities. Therefore, Option D is the \"best\" choice among a flawed set of options, likely representing the intended, albeit incorrectly stated, synthetic plan.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene requires a careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents and the order of the reactions. The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nLet's analyze the relative positions and directing effects:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky and sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   The final product has a 1, 2, 3 substitution pattern, meaning all three groups are adjacent. This is a sterically crowded arrangement that often requires a multi-step synthesis with careful use of blocking groups to achieve a high yield.\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed reaction sequences:\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis sequence employs a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a blocking group, which is a common strategy for controlling regiochemistry. The -SO3H group is a deactivating, *meta*-director that can be added and later removed (desulfonation) by heating with dilute acid.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene produces **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer, **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The t-butyl group directs *ortho* to itself (position 2), and the sulfonic acid group directs *meta* to itself (position 2). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group, forming **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group creates a diazonium salt, **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** This step as written is unusual. However, in the context of the full synthesis, it's likely a flawed representation of a step or part of a more complex transformation. Given the subsequent steps, the overall goal is to replace the original amino group with a hydroxyl and introduce a new nitro group in the correct final position. Often in complex problems like this, one step may be non-standard or represent a rearrangement.\n*   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, forming **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **viii) dilute H2SO4:** Desulfonation removes the sulfonic acid group, yielding **3-tert-butylphenol**.\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** This sequence seems out of order with the previous steps.\n\nLet's reconsider the sequence. A logical synthesis would need to create the 2-tBu, 3-NO2 phenol precursor. The sequence in Option A is the only one that utilizes the crucial strategy of adding a blocking group (sulfonation) and later removing it (desulfonation). This is the most powerful technique presented in the options to overcome standard directing effects and achieve a complex substitution pattern. While some steps appear mechanistically questionable as written, the overall strategy is the most plausible for a high-yield synthesis of a complex molecule like the target. The other options (B, C, D) follow more straightforward reaction paths that, based on standard directing rules, would lead to different isomers and not the desired 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. For instance, options B and C would likely produce an isomer with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. Option D also leads to an intermediate with the wrong substitution pattern. Therefore, Option A, despite its apparent flaws, represents the correct strategic approach.\n\nLet's re-examine the steps of A assuming there might be a rearrangement or a non-obvious outcome. The presence of both sulfonation and desulfonation is the strongest indicator that this is the intended path for a complex regiochemical problem. No other option provides a mechanism to override the strong para-directing nature of the tert-butyl group.\n\nFinal evaluation points towards Option A being the intended answer because it is the only one that includes the necessary strategic steps (use of a removable blocking group) to synthesize a sterically hindered, 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative, even if the details of one or two steps are ambiguous or potentially contain typos.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAn analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene requires a careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents and a logical sequence of reactions. The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nLet's analyze the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nA plausible synthetic strategy often involves installing groups in an order that leverages their directing effects, sometimes using blocking groups to control regiochemistry. A common blocking group is the sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be added by sulfonation and later removed by heating with dilute acid (desulfonation).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **Options A, B, and C:** These sequences list the diazotization step (using NaNO2/HCl) before the reduction of a nitro group to an amine (using Fe/HCl). Diazotization can only be performed on a primary aromatic amine. Since the amine is not formed until a later step, these sequences are chemically incorrect as written.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence presents a more logical progression of transformations, although it may contain its own complexities or typos. Let's analyze it step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard and high-yield first step.\n    2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** This is the sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director, but due to sterics, the para product, **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**, is formed almost exclusively. This step effectively \"blocks\" the para position.\n    3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is the nitration of 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. The t-butyl group directs ortho (positions 2 and 6), and the sulfonic acid group directs meta (positions 2 and 6). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions, leading to a high yield of **2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** This step reduces the nitro group to an amine, yielding **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** This step correctly follows the formation of the amine. It converts the amino group into a diazonium salt, forming the corresponding diazonium salt of 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    6.  **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** This step, as written, is highly unusual (nitration of a diazonium salt) and is likely a typo in the option. However, the preceding steps follow a logical and powerful synthetic strategy (the blocking group strategy).\n    7.  **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** This reagent is used to convert a diazonium salt into a phenol.\n    8.  **viii) dilute H2SO4:** This reagent is used for desulfonation (removing the -SO3H group).\n    9.  **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis to convert a phenol into an ethoxy ether.\n\nWhile the exact sequence of the final steps in option D is confusing and likely contains an error (step vi), the initial strategy (steps i-v) is the most chemically sound approach among all the choices for controlling the substitution pattern. The other options (A, B, C) contain fundamental flaws in the reaction order that make them impossible. By elimination, Option D represents the most plausible, albeit imperfectly described, pathway.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene requires a careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents at each step to ensure the correct final arrangement (substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3).\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Target Molecule**: The final product has three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2). Synthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene often requires a multi-step approach with careful control of regiochemistry, as placing a third group between two existing meta-substituents is sterically hindered.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Synthetic Routes**: Let's analyze the sequence presented in Option C, as the other options contain significant chemical impossibilities in their sequences.\n    *   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene**: This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director for subsequent reactions.\n    *   **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene**: This nitration step produces a mixture of ortho and para products. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is the para isomer, 1-(tert-butyl)-4-nitrobenzene. However, the ortho isomer is also formed and would need to be separated to continue the synthesis. While not a high-yield step for the ortho product, it is a chemically possible transformation.\n    *   **iii) 1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → 2-(tert-butyl)aniline**: This is a standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n    *   **iv) 2-(tert-butyl)aniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**: In the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The anilinium ion is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group at position 2 is an ortho, para-director (directing to positions 3, 5, and 1). Both groups, therefore, direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (and 5). This makes the formation of the desired 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline plausible, although a mixture with the 5-nitro isomer is likely.\n    *   **v) 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt**: This is a standard diazotization reaction of a primary aromatic amine.\n    *   **vi) Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol upon heating in an aqueous acidic solution.\n    *   **vii) 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**: This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack the ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming the final ethoxy ether product.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: The sequence of reactions i through vii in option C provides a chemically logical, albeit not perfectly high-yield, pathway to the target molecule. The remaining steps listed in option C, (viii) SO3/H2SO4 and (ix) dilute H2SO4, are the reagents for a blocking group strategy that could have been used to improve the yield of step (ii), but they are superfluous in the context of the sequence as presented. The other options contain more severe flaws: Option A attempts to use a diazotization reagent on a molecule without an amine group. Option B follows a sequence that would lead to p-tert-butylethoxybenzene. Option D begins with a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline, which is generally unsuccessful due to the Lewis acid catalyst complexing with the basic amine. Therefore, Option C represents the most viable synthetic route among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's identify the substituents and their relative positions:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. Synthesizing such a crowded substitution pattern requires careful control of directing effects, often using blocking groups. The key relationships are that the bulky tert-butyl group is ortho to both the ethoxy and the nitro groups.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky, which can sterically hinder substitution at adjacent (ortho) positions.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Routes (Options A-D)**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to identify the most viable strategy for installing the groups with the correct regiochemistry in high yield. We can often find the correct answer by identifying fatal flaws in the other options.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Due to its large size, the incoming nitro group will preferentially add to the para position, which is sterically unhindered. The major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene. The desired ortho-isomer, a necessary precursor, would be a minor product. A \"high-yield synthesis\" would not rely on a low-yield step, so this route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Forms nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduces nitrobenzene to aniline.\n    *   iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) is an acid, and the amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a base. They react to form a complex, which deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution. This is not a viable synthetic step.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   This option contains a chemically nonsensical step. Step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. However, the product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid derivative of nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which does not have an amino group. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group directs the incoming electrophile (-SO3H) to the ortho and para positions. The para position is sterically more accessible, so the major product is **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a classic example of using a reversible **blocking group**. The sulfonic acid group now occupies the para position.\n    *   iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Now, we have two directing groups:\n        *   -tBu (at C1) is an o,p-director. Its para position (C4) is blocked by the -SO3H group. It therefore directs the incoming nitro group to the ortho positions (C2, C6).\n        *   -SO3H (at C4) is a deactivating, meta-director. It directs incoming groups to positions C2 and C6.\n        *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the C2 (and C6) position. This allows for a high-yield synthesis of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This intermediate has the crucial ortho relationship between the tert-butyl group and a nitro group, which is a key feature of the final product's substitution pattern.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe strategy outlined in Option B is the only one that provides a high-yield route to an intermediate with the required ortho-substitution pattern. The use of sulfonation as a blocking strategy is a key synthetic technique for achieving this type of regiochemical control. While the full sequence of later steps (iv-ix) is complex and may contain typos as written, the initial three steps are fundamentally sound and represent the only plausible high-yield strategy among the choices. The other options contain fatal flaws that make them non-viable. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAfter a thorough analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions and considering the directing effects of the various functional groups, a plausible high-yield synthesis route can be determined. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The key challenge is establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nLet's analyze the correct sequence of reactions, which corresponds to option D, with the understanding that some steps are standard multi-part procedures.\n\n*   **Step i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Benzene is alkylated to form tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but due to its large size, it strongly favors substitution at the *para* position.\n\n*   **Step ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is a nitration reaction. The nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields primarily 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene because the bulky tert-butyl group sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n\n*   **Step iii) Fe/HCl:** This is the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group. 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene is reduced to 4-tert-butylaniline. The resulting amino group (-NH2) is a strong activating *ortho, para*-director.\n\n*   **Step iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** This step represents the nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. Direct nitration of anilines can be problematic due to oxidation and the formation of anilinium ions in the strong acid, which would direct *meta*. To achieve the desired regiochemistry, the highly activating amino group is typically first protected by acetylation (e.g., with acetic anhydride) to form an acetanilide. This amide is still a potent *o,p*-director but is less prone to side reactions. The position *para* to the directing group is already occupied by the tert-butyl group, so nitration occurs at the *ortho* position, yielding 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroacetanilide. A subsequent hydrolysis step (acid or base-catalyzed) would then remove the acetyl protecting group to give **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. This entire protection-nitration-deprotection sequence is often abbreviated in multi-step synthesis problems.\n\n*   **Step v) NaNO2/HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine, 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline, is converted into a diazonium salt at low temperatures.\n\n*   **Step vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** This step involves the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **Step vii) NaOH/EtBr:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is first deprotonated by a base (NaOH) to form a more nucleophilic phenoxide ion. This ion then attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr) in an SN2 reaction to form an ether. This converts 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol into **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt this point, the substituents are in a 1,2,4-arrangement (ethoxy, nitro, tert-butyl). The final two steps are designed to rearrange the substitution pattern to the desired 1,2,3-arrangement through a clever use of a blocking group and an *ipso*-substitution (substitution at a position already occupied by a non-hydrogen substituent).\n\n*   **Step viii) SO3/H2SO4:** This is a sulfonation reaction. The goal is to replace the tert-butyl group with a nitro group. To do this, the position *ortho* to the nitro group and *meta* to the ethoxy group (position 3) must be activated for a subsequent step. However, a more direct interpretation involves an *ipso*-nitration, where a bulky group like tert-butyl is replaced by the incoming nitro group. Often, sulfonation is used to block a position, but in this context, it's more likely that steps viii and ix are part of a more complex transformation or there is a flaw in the proposed sequence.\n\nHowever, if we re-evaluate the options and the target molecule, it becomes clear that there is a significant error in all the provided choices, as none of them logically lead to the final product 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The sequence in option D leads to 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene, which is an isomer of the target compound. The subsequent steps (viii and ix) in option D do not correct this.\n\nGiven the constraints of the multiple-choice question, there is likely an error in the question itself or the provided options. No sequence listed correctly and efficiently produces the target molecule. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" sequence that correctly assembles a trisubstituted benzene with the given reagents, option D is the most chemically plausible for the first seven steps, despite leading to the wrong isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python code successfully analyzed the multi-step synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. It performed a step-by-step evaluation of the reaction sequence presented in Option A, correctly identifying the role of each reagent and the resulting intermediate. The analysis highlighted the key strategies for achieving the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Adding the tert-butyl group first.\n2.  **Blocking Group:** Using sulfonation to block the para position, forcing subsequent substitutions into the ortho positions.\n3.  **Directed Nitration:** Adding the first nitro group ortho to the tert-butyl group.\n4.  **Functional Group Interconversion:** Reducing the nitro group to an amine, then converting it to a diazonium salt. This allows for the introduction of a hydroxyl group later.\n5.  **Second Nitration:** Adding the second nitro group.\n6.  **Final Conversions:** Replacing the diazonium salt with a hydroxyl group, removing the sulfonic acid blocking group, and finally converting the hydroxyl to an ethoxy ether.\n\nThe code concluded that this sequence is a logical and viable route to the target molecule, whereas the other options contained incorrect steps or would lead to the wrong isomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThe goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and evaluate the proposed reaction sequences.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) is at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) is at position 2 (ortho to the ethoxy group).\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) is at position 3 (meta to the ethoxy group and ortho to the tert-butyl group).\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. Synthesizing such a specific substitution pattern requires careful control of the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\nLet's analyze the logical sequence of reactions required to build this molecule, which typically involves installing the groups in a specific order and converting functional groups.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Ether (-OEt):** The ethoxy group is an ether. The most common and effective way to form an aryl ether is the Williamson ether synthesis. This involves reacting a phenoxide (formed by treating a phenol with a base like NaOH) with an alkyl halide (like ethyl bromide, EtBr). This suggests the final step is the conversion of a phenol to an ether. The precursor would be **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Phenol (-OH):** A common method to introduce a hydroxyl group onto a benzene ring is through the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt. The diazonium salt is prepared from a primary aromatic amine (an aniline derivative) by reacting it with nitrous acid (generated in situ from NaNO2 and HCl). This means the precursor to the phenol is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n3.  **Synthesis of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** This is the key intermediate. We need to construct a benzene ring with an amino group, a tert-butyl group, and a nitro group in a 1,2,3-relationship. Let's trace the steps from benzene.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this logical retrosynthesis. We are looking for a sequence that first builds the carbon skeleton and installs the nitrogen-containing groups in the correct positions, then converts them to the final functional groups.\n\nThe required core sequence is:\n*   Introduction of the tert-butyl group.\n*   Introduction of two nitrogen-containing groups that will become the amino and nitro groups.\n*   Conversion of one nitrogen group to an amine (-NH2).\n*   Diazotization of the amine (-NH2 → -N2+).\n*   Conversion to a phenol (-N2+ → -OH).\n*   Conversion to an ether (-OH → -OEt).\n\nNow let's examine the provided options:\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a good first step.\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *o*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To achieve the 1,2,3-pattern, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This step is not high-yield but is necessary to establish the 1,2 relationship.\n    *   iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amine group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is the crucial step to set up the 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n    *   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group in 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n    *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   viii) `SO3/H2SO4` and ix) `dilute H2SO4`: These sulfonation and desulfonation steps are nonsensically placed at the end of the synthesis and serve no purpose. They are likely an error in the question's options.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence is incorrect because it attempts to perform a diazotization reaction (step iv) on a molecule that does not contain a primary amine group.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence is flawed. It attempts to perform hydrolysis (step viii) before the necessary diazotization step (v).\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is incorrect. It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (step vi), which is not a standard or logical reaction in this context.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDespite the inclusion of two extraneous and misplaced steps at the end (viii and ix), Option A is the only one that presents a chemically logical sequence of core reactions to transform benzene into the target molecule. The pathway correctly utilizes directing group effects (including the meta-directing anilinium ion) to establish the required 1,2,3-substitution pattern before carrying out the final functional group conversions.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a self-debate to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**Proposer:** The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with two ortho,para-directing groups (ethoxy, tert-butyl) and one meta-directing group (nitro). The arrangement is complex, suggesting that a multi-step synthesis with careful control of directing effects, possibly involving blocking groups, is necessary.\n\nI propose that the correct path involves a blocking group strategy. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is ideal for this as it can be added to block a position and later removed. Option D begins with a sequence that aligns with this strategy:\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation. The bulky tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director, but for steric reasons, sulfonation will overwhelmingly occur at the para position, yielding 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. This blocks the para position.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. Now, the tert-butyl group directs ortho (to positions 2 and 6) and the sulfonic acid group directs meta (to positions 3 and 5). However, looking at the starting material (4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid), the positions ortho to the t-butyl group (C2, C6) are meta to the sulfonic acid group. Therefore, the directing effects of both groups reinforce each other, and nitration should occur at the position ortho to the tert-butyl group.\n\nThis initial sequence represents a sound and sophisticated strategy required for such a synthesis. While the rest of the steps in option D appear jumbled, this strong start makes it the most plausible intended path. My first action will be to search and confirm the regioselectivity of this key nitration step.\n\n**Skeptic:** The Proposer's argument hinges on the initial steps of Option D being a sound \"blocking group\" strategy. The search results confirm that sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene yields the para product and that using blocking groups is a valid strategy for complex syntheses. However, the Proposer's own analysis of the subsequent nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid is critical. Both the t-butyl group (o,p-director) and the sulfonic acid group (m-director) direct incoming electrophiles to the same positions (C3 and C5, relative to the sulfonic acid at C1). This is confirmed by the principles of additive effects in disubstituted benzenes. This means the nitration product is **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\nThis intermediate has the nitro and tert-butyl groups *ortho* to each other. In the final target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, the tert-butyl and nitro groups are also *ortho* to each other. This seems promising. However, the skeptic points out that to get from the intermediate to the product, the sulfonic acid group must be replaced by an ethoxy group, and the positions must align.\n\nLet's trace the consequence of forming 3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid:\n- Intermediate structure: SO3H at C1, H at C2, NO2 at C3, tBu at C4.\n- Target structure: OEt at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C3.\n\nThis requires the t-butyl group to move from C4 to C2, which is a skeletal rearrangement not possible with the given reagents. Therefore, the entire premise that this path leads to the product is flawed. All logical chemical pathways constructed so far fail to produce the target molecule in high yield. The options provided are either chemically impossible (B, C), lead to the wrong, non-rearrangeable isomer (A), or are based on a strategy that also leads to the wrong isomer (D). Rule 3 from search result also states that substitution rarely occurs between two meta-substituents due to steric hindrance, which makes the formation of any 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring challenging.\n\n**Decision:** The debate reveals that none of the provided options represent a chemically sound, high-yield synthesis for the named target molecule. There are irreconcilable inconsistencies in the directing effects and the resulting substitution patterns. Option A describes a clear sequence of reactions that leads to a different, specific isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene). Options B and C contain impossible steps. Option D proposes a valid strategy (blocking group) but the steps are out of order and the strategy itself does not lead to the correct final structure based on established principles of regioselectivity.\n\nGiven that a choice must be made from the provided options, and acknowledging the high probability of an error in the question's target name or reaction sequences, the most logical approach is to identify the option that describes a coherent, albeit flawed, sequence of established chemical reactions.\n\nOption A is the only one that presents a sequence of individually plausible reactions (alkylation, nitration, reduction, nitration of an aniline derivative, diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) that would lead to a defined trisubstituted nitroaromatic product, even if it's not the one named in the question. The other options contain either impossible steps or a sequence so jumbled that it cannot be rationally interpreted. Therefore, Option A is the \"least wrong\" answer, assuming a typo in the name of the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and evaluate the proposed synthetic routes.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  Ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1: Strong activator, ortho-, para-director.\n    2.  tert-Butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃) at C2: Weak activator, ortho-, para-director.\n    3.  Nitro group (-NO₂) at C3: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n*   **Relationships:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO₂ are *meta* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO₂ are *ortho* to each other.\n\nThe meta relationship between the activating ethoxy group and the deactivating nitro group is a key challenge. This suggests that one of these groups was introduced when a meta-director was present on the ring, or a group's directing effect was changed during the synthesis (e.g., reducing -NO₂ to -NH₂).\n\nLet's evaluate each option step-by-step.\n\n**A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ; v) dilute H₂SO₄ ; vi) H₃O+, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n*   i) Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation)\n*   ii) tert-butylbenzene → o/p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n*   iii) Sulfonation of the nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n*   iv) NaNO₂/HCl is used for diazotization of a primary amine. At this stage, there is no amine group present. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vii) dilute H₂SO₄ ; viii) H₃O+, H₂O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃) on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vii) H₃O+, H₂O/Heat ; viii) dilute H₂SO₄ ix) NaOH/EtBr**\n*   This sequence attempts to use a sulfonic acid group as a blocking group to achieve ortho-nitration, which is a valid strategy.\n*   i) Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\n*   ii) tert-butylbenzene → p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   iii) Nitration gives 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   iv) Reduction of the nitro group gives 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   v) Diazotization of the amine.\n*   vi) Nitration of a diazonium salt is not a standard or logical reaction in this context. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O+, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ix) dilute H₂SO₄**\nLet's analyze the first seven steps of this sequence, as steps viii and ix (sulfonation/desulfonation) are nonsensical at the end of the synthesis and are likely distractors or an error in the question.\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an ortho-, para-director. This step produces a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para product is major due to sterics, so this is not a high-yield step for the ortho isomer. However, the ortho isomer is formed and can be separated. Let's proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In a strong acid like H₂SO₄, the amine is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The anilinium ion is a meta-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to the position meta to the -NH₃⁺ group, which is C3. This correctly installs the second nitro group to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n*   **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The primary amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt.\n*   **vi) H₃O+, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, replacing the -N₂⁺ group with an -OH group to give **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis. NaOH deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide attacks ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence (i-vii) is chemically sound and leads to the desired product. While step (ii) has yield limitations, the overall strategy correctly navigates the complex directing effects. The other options contain chemically impossible steps. Therefore, this is the only viable pathway among the choices.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAfter a thorough analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution directing effects and considering common multi-step synthesis strategies, a plausible high-yield pathway can be constructed. The key to this synthesis is controlling the regiochemistry, particularly the introduction of substituents at adjacent positions (1, 2, and 3), which is often challenging. The use of a blocking group is a classic strategy for such a challenge.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on a chemically sound reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** The synthesis should begin by adding the tert-butyl group to the benzene ring.\n    *   Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → tert-Butylbenzene.\n\n2.  **Blocking the Para Position:** The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. To force subsequent reactions to occur at the *ortho* position with high yield, the more accessible and electronically favored *para* position must be blocked. Sulfonation is ideal for this, as the sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) is large and can be removed later.\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + SO₃/H₂SO₄ → *p*-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n3.  **Nitration:** With the *para* position blocked, nitration will occur at the position *ortho* to the tert-butyl group. Both the tert-butyl group (*ortho, para*-directing) and the sulfonic acid group (*meta*-directing) direct the incoming nitro group to this same position.\n    *   *p*-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 2-Nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n4.  **Reduction of the Nitro Group:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, which is a versatile functional group for further transformations.\n    *   2-Nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n5.  **Diazotization and Introduction of the Nitro Group:** This is the most complex part of the synthesis and where the provided options are confusing. A logical path to the final product requires the synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** as a key intermediate. However, none of the options present a clear, standard method to achieve this. There seems to be a significant error in the reaction sequences provided in the options. For instance, option D, which starts correctly, lists nonsensical subsequent steps like nitrating a diazonium salt.\n\nLet's reconsider the intermediates and the final product structure: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. A crucial intermediate for this synthesis would be 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol, which could then be converted to the final product via Williamson ether synthesis.\n\nLet's re-examine the options to see if any could possibly lead to this intermediate, even with typos.\n\n*   **Option A:** Leads to 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene, an incorrect isomer.\n*   **Option B:** Fails at step (iii) because Friedel-Crafts alkylation does not work on aniline.\n*   **Option C:** The order of reactions is incorrect (e.g., diazotization before an amine is formed).\n*   **Option D:** Starts with the most logical and high-yield sequence (alkylation, sulfonation, nitration) to create an *ortho*-substituted product. However, the subsequent steps (iv-ix) are jumbled and chemically illogical as written. For example, reducing a nitro group (iv) only to diazotize it (v) and then attempt another nitration (vi) makes no sense.\n\nGiven the significant flaws in all the provided options, it's impossible to select one as a correct high-yield synthesis route. The question or the options are fundamentally flawed. However, if forced to choose the *best start* to a high-yield synthesis that correctly controls the initial regiochemistry, Option D's first three steps represent the most advanced and appropriate strategy for creating the necessary *ortho*-substituted intermediate. The rest of the sequence in option D is incorrect, but it is the only option that employs the necessary blocking group strategy for a high-yield synthesis of an *ortho*-substituted product from a *para*-directing starting material.\n\nSince a definitive correct answer cannot be derived from the flawed options, and based on the initial correct strategic steps, no option is fully correct. However, if this is a multiple-choice question from a source, there might be an intended answer despite the errors. Without a correct sequence provided, I cannot logically deduce the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step analysis of each option to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\nThis molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3-arrangement, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and competing directing effects.\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strong activator, ortho/para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weak activator, ortho/para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\ni) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene.** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\nii) **tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.** This is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an ortho/para director. Due to the large steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the para product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is the major product. The ortho product (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) is the minor product. To achieve the final 1,2,3-substitution pattern, we must proceed with the minor ortho isomer. This step already makes the synthesis not \"high-yield\", but let's continue.\niii) **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → 2-tert-butylaniline.** This is a standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\niv) **2-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.** This is the crucial step. Nitration of an aniline derivative under strongly acidic conditions (like HNO3/H2SO4) protonates the amino group to form an anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n    *   The anilinium ion (-NH3+) at C1 is a meta-director, directing incoming electrophiles to positions 3 and 5.\n    *   The tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2 is an ortho/para-director. The ortho positions relative to C2 are C1 (blocked) and C3. The para position is C5. So, the -tBu group also directs to positions 3 and 5.\n    *   Since both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (3 and 5), this reaction is feasible. It will produce a mixture of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline and 2-tert-butyl-5-nitroaniline. We need the 3-nitro isomer.\nv) **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenyldiazonium chloride.** This is the standard diazotization of a primary aromatic amine.\nvi) **Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group upon heating in aqueous acid.\nvii) **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to displace bromide from ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming the desired ether. This sequence successfully produces the target molecule.\nviii) & ix) **SO3/H2SO4 (Sulfonation)** and **dilute H2SO4 (Desulfonation).** These final two steps are redundant as the target molecule has already been formed. They are likely included as distractors or perhaps as a theoretical purification step, but they are not essential for the synthesis itself.\n\nDespite the low-yield steps, this sequence is chemically plausible and leads to the correct product.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) **Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.**\nii) **Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.**\niii) **Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → 3-tert-butylaniline.** Friedel-Crafts reactions on anilines are problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, converting it into a strongly deactivating, meta-directing -NH2-AlCl3 group. Thus, alkylation occurs at the meta position.\niv) **3-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → Mixture.** The -NH2 group (o,p-director) and -tBu group (o,p-director) would direct nitration to positions 4 and 6, not giving the required 1,2,3 pattern. This path does not lead to the target product.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene.**\nii) **tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** Sulfonation occurs preferentially at the para position due to sterics.\niii) **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** Both -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) direct to position 2.\niv) **+ Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** Reduction of the nitro group.\nv) **+ NaNO2/HCl → Diazotization.**\nvi) **+ HNO3/H2SO4 → ?** This step is chemically nonsensical. You do not nitrate a diazonium salt in this manner. The sequence is flawed.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene.**\nii) **tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.** (Major product).\niii) **+ SO3/H2SO4 → 2-sulfo-1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.** The ring is deactivated, but both groups direct to position 2.\niv) **+ NaNO2/HCl → ?** This is a diazotization reagent, but there is no primary amine group to react with. This sequence is chemically impossible as written.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the four options, only sequence A provides a chemically viable (though not necessarily high-yield) route to the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The other options contain chemically flawed steps or lead to incorrect isomers. The key to sequence A is the nitration of the 2-tert-butylanilinium ion, where the directing effects of the two substituents cooperate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's examine the substituents and their relative positions on the benzene ring:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)** at position 1. This is a strongly activating, *ortho, para*-directing group.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)** at position 2. This is a weakly activating, *ortho, para*-directing group. It is very bulky.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)** at position 3. This is a strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n\nThe key relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n\n**2. Develop a General Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis of polysubstituted benzenes requires careful consideration of the order of substitution and the directing effects of the groups.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The -OEt group is an ether. Ethers are commonly formed via the Williamson ether synthesis, which involves reacting an alkoxide with an alkyl halide. This suggests the final step is the reaction of a phenol with a base and an ethyl halide (e.g., NaOH/EtBr). This means the immediate precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **The Main Challenge:** The core of the problem is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol. Let's analyze its structure:\n    *   -OH at C1\n    *   -tBu at C2\n    *   -NO2 at C3\n    The -OH group (a strong *o,p*-director) is *meta* to the -NO2 group. This is a very difficult arrangement to achieve through direct electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) on a phenol, as the -OH group would direct nitration to the *ortho* (C2, C6) and *para* (C4) positions.\n\n*   **Plausible Strategy:** To overcome this directing group conflict, a more complex strategy involving blocking groups and/or the conversion of one functional group into another is necessary. The use of a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a temporary blocking group is a common and powerful technique. It can be introduced to block a reactive position (like the *para* position) and then removed later in the synthesis (desulfonation).\n\n**3. Analyze the Given Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on chemical principles.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    Step (ii) produces p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Step (iv) attempts to react this with NaNO2/HCl. This reagent is for the diazotization of primary aromatic amines (-NH2), not nitro compounds (-NO2). This sequence is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Step (v) creates a diazonium salt. Step (vi) attempts to sulfonate this diazonium salt using fuming sulfuric acid. Diazonium salts are generally unstable and would decompose under these harsh conditions. This step is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This sequence includes sulfonation (step viii) followed immediately by desulfonation (step ix). This is a redundant and pointless pair of steps. The sequence is illogical.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr`\n    Let's analyze this sequence carefully. It appears complex and contains a strange step, but let's trace the logic.\n    *   **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   **ii) Sulfonation → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** The bulky t-Bu group directs the incoming -SO3H group to the sterically accessible *para* position. This effectively \"blocks\" the para position.\n    *   **iii) Nitration → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** Now, nitration occurs. The -tBu group directs *ortho*, and the -SO3H group directs *meta*. Both direct to the same position (C2). This is a highly regioselective step.\n    *   **iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 4-tert-Butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    *   **v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) → Diazonium salt:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    *   **Steps vi, vii, viii:** This is the most complex part. The sequence as written has a problematic step (vi, nitrating a diazonium salt). However, it's highly likely there is a typo in the order of these steps. A chemically logical sequence would be to first convert the diazonium salt to a phenol, then nitrate, then desulfonate. Let's see if that works:\n        *   **Let's assume the intended order was (v) → (vii) → (vi) → (viii):**\n        *   **(vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        *   **(vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** Now, we nitrate this phenol. Let's analyze the directing effects:\n            *   -OH (at C2) is a strong *o,p*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n            *   -tBu (at C4) is an *o,p*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n            *   -SO3H (at C1) is a *m*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n            *   Remarkably, all three groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to positions C3 and C5. This would be a highly selective nitration. Let's assume substitution occurs at C3. The product is **3-nitro-4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        *   **(viii) dilute H2SO4:** This step causes desulfonation, removing the -SO3H group from C1. The resulting molecule has -OH at C2, -NO2 at C3, and -tBu at C4. Renaming this according to IUPAC rules (phenol is the parent), we get **3-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **Wait, this is an isomer of our target precursor!** The target precursor is 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. This means even with a logical reordering, sequence A does not produce the exact target molecule.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThere appears to be a flaw in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the steps of the correct option. However, when forced to choose the best option among the given choices:\n*   Options B, C, and D contain clear, fundamental chemical errors that make them invalid.\n*   Option A outlines a sophisticated and strategically sound plan: it uses a blocking group to control regiochemistry, followed by functional group interconversions. While it contains a questionable step (vi) as written, and even a logical reordering leads to an isomer, its overall framework is far superior to the other options. In the context of a multiple-choice question, one must select the \"most plausible\" or \"least incorrect\" pathway. The strategy employed in option A is the only one that demonstrates a correct approach to solving this type of complex synthesis problem.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the intended answer, despite its apparent flaws.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. The relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) are:\n*   **-OEt**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-directing. It is very bulky, which can hinder substitution at the ortho position.\n*   **-NO2**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with a bulky group like tert-butyl adjacent to two other substituents, is sterically hindered and challenging to achieve through direct substitution. This suggests a complex synthesis, possibly involving blocking groups or the modification of functional groups to alter their directing effects.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option. A common strategy in such problems is to identify any chemically nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Option B**: `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Step (v) is the diazotization of an amine formed in step (iv). Step (vi) involves reacting the resulting diazonium salt with a nitrating mixture (HNO3/H2SO4). This is not a standard or logical transformation for a diazonium salt. This option is likely incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C**: `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    Step (iii) is the sulfonation of p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The product is a sulfonic acid. Step (iv) attempts to perform a diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), but this reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2), which is not present. This sequence is chemically impossible. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D**: `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Similar to option B, this sequence involves reacting a diazonium salt (from step v) with fuming sulfuric acid (SO3/H2SO4). This is not a standard synthetic step for introducing a sulfonic acid group in this manner. This option is likely incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This option does not contain any fundamentally impossible reaction sequences. Each reagent is used in a context where a reaction can occur. Let's analyze the sequence in detail to see if it leads to the target product.\n\n**3. Detailed Analysis of Option A**\n\nLet's trace the reaction path for option A.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene**: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   Product: **tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene**: This is nitration. The -tBu group is *o,p*-directing, but due to its large steric bulk, the major product is the *para* isomer.\n    *   Major Product: **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene).\n\n*   **iii) Fe/HCl on p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**: This is the reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n    *   Product: **p-tert-butylaniline** (4-tert-butylaniline).\n\n*   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on p-tert-butylaniline**: This is the nitration of an aniline derivative. In strong acid (H2SO4), the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n    *   Substrate: 4-tert-butylanilinium ion. The -NH3+ is at C1 and -tBu is at C4.\n    *   The -NH3+ group directs nitration to the positions *meta* to it (C3 and C5).\n    *   The -tBu group directs to the positions *ortho* to it (C3 and C5).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C3 or C5).\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**: This is the diazotization of the primary amine.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt**: This is the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**: This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr).\n    *   Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt this point, we have synthesized an isomer of the target molecule. The target is 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene. Our product is 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene. The difference is the position of the tert-butyl group (C2 vs. C4).\n\n*   **viii) SO3/H2SO4 and ix) dilute H2SO4**: These final two steps are sulfonation followed by desulfonation. Under these acidic and heating conditions, reversible Friedel-Crafts alkylation can occur, leading to the migration of the tert-butyl group. The reaction mixture equilibrates towards the most thermodynamically stable isomer.\n    *   Let's compare the stability of the isomer we have (1-ethoxy-4-tBu-3-nitrobenzene) and the target isomer (1-ethoxy-2-tBu-3-nitrobenzene).\n    *   **Our isomer**: The tBu group is at C4, which is *para* to the activating -OEt group and *ortho* to the deactivating -NO2 group.\n    *   **Target isomer**: The tBu group is at C2, which is *ortho* to both the -OEt and -NO2 groups. This position is extremely sterically hindered.\n    *   The rearrangement from the C4 position to the highly crowded C2 position is thermodynamically unfavorable. Therefore, this sequence will not produce the target molecule in high yield.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the synthesis described in option A does not lead to the named target product via a straightforward thermodynamic argument, it is the only option that presents a chemically plausible sequence of reactions. Options B, C, and D contain steps that are nonsensical in standard organic synthesis (e.g., attempting diazotization without an amine, or reacting a diazonium salt with nitrating mixture). In the context of a multiple-choice question, one must select the \"best\" answer. Option A is the best choice because it is free from the fundamental flaws that invalidate the other options. It is likely that the question is flawed, either in the name of the target molecule or in the design of the synthetic pathway. However, based on eliminating the impossible options, A remains the only viable choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe substituents have the following directing effects for electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-OEt**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -tBu is *ortho* to -OEt.\n*   -NO2 is *meta* to -OEt.\n*   -NO2 is *ortho* to -tBu.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly and typically requires a multi-step synthesis involving blocking groups or functional group manipulations.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nWe will analyze each option step-by-step to see if it leads to the desired product. We will keep track of the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. For clarity, we'll initially number the substituents based on their order of introduction relative to the first substituent placed on the ring.\n\n---\n\n#### **Analysis of Option A**\n\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → tert-butylbenzene.**\n    *   This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. We now have a -tBu group on the ring. Let's place it at C1.\n    *   Intermediate: **tert-butylbenzene** (tBu at C1).\n\n*   **ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming -SO₃H group to the sterically less hindered *para* position (C4). The sulfonic acid group will serve as a blocking group.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, SO₃H at C4).\n\n*   **iii) 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is nitration. We have an *o,p*-director (-tBu at C1) and a *m*-director (-SO₃H at C4).\n    *   The -tBu group directs to C2 and C6 (ortho positions).\n    *   The -SO₃H group directs to C2 and C6 (meta positions).\n    *   Both groups direct the nitration to the same positions (C2/C6). The reaction proceeds cleanly.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, NO₂ at C2, SO₃H at C4). Note that the -tBu and -NO₂ groups are *ortho* to each other.\n\n*   **iv) ... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is the reduction of the nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   Intermediate: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, NH₂ at C2, SO₃H at C4).\n\n*   **v) ... + NaNO₂/HCl → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is the diazotization of the primary amine.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, N₂⁺ at C2, SO₃H at C4).\n\n*   **vi) ... + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is a second nitration. Let's analyze the directing effects on the diazonium salt intermediate.\n    *   -tBu at C1 is an *o,p*-director (directs to C6, as C2/C4 are substituted).\n    *   -N₂⁺ at C2 is a *m*-director (directs to C4/C6, C4 is substituted).\n    *   -SO₃H at C4 is a *m*-director (directs to C2/C6, C2 is substituted).\n    *   All three groups direct the incoming nitro group to C6. This is a highly specific reaction.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, N₂⁺ at C2, SO₃H at C4, NO₂ at C6).\n\n*   **vii) ... + H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol.**\n    *   This step involves two key transformations that occur upon heating in aqueous acid:\n        1.  **Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt**: The -N₂⁺ group at C2 is replaced by an -OH group.\n        2.  **Desulfonation**: The -SO₃H group at C4 is removed and replaced by -H.\n    *   The resulting molecule has: -tBu at C1, -OH at C2, and -NO₂ at C6.\n    *   Intermediate: **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **viii) ... + dilute H₂SO₄**\n    *   This step is likely redundant or ensures the completion of the previous step.\n\n*   **ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.**\n    *   This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol (-OH) is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether.\n    *   The -OH group on 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol is converted to an -OEt group.\n    *   Final Product has: -tBu at C1, -OEt at C2, -NO₂ at C6 (using the original numbering).\n    *   **Let's determine the IUPAC name of this final product.** The -OEt group has the highest priority for numbering, so its carbon is the new C1.\n        *   Original C2 (with -OEt) becomes New C1.\n        *   Numbering towards the next substituent gives the lowest locants: Original C1 (with -tBu) becomes New C2. Original C6 (with -NO₂) becomes New C3.\n        *   The locants are 1, 2, 3.\n        *   The name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   This matches the target molecule. Therefore, sequence A is a valid and high-yield pathway.\n\n---\n\n#### **Analysis of Other Options (Briefly)**\n\n*   **Option B & C:** Both start by nitrating tert-butylbenzene (step ii), which predominantly forms the *para* isomer (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene). Starting with a 1,4-disubstituted compound makes it very difficult to achieve the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern in a high-yield synthesis. Furthermore, step (iv) in option B (NaNO₂/HCl) is applied to an intermediate without an amino group, which is incorrect. Step (vii) in option C leads to an isomer of the target, not the target itself.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence starts with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, converting it into a deactivating, *meta*-directing group (-NH₂-AlCl₃). This would lead to *m*-tert-butylaniline, which does not have the required substitution pattern for subsequent steps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions described in Option A is the only one that correctly utilizes blocking groups and directing effects to systematically build the desired 1,2,3-substituted aromatic ring with high regioselectivity at each step.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   At position 1: an ethoxy group (-OEt).\n*   At position 2: a tert-butyl group (-tBu).\n*   At position 3: a nitro group (-NO2).\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The arrangement of these groups is crucial and often difficult to achieve via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) due to the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at its ortho positions.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Plausibility of the Final Steps (Retrosynthesis)**\n\n*   **Introducing -NO2 last:** The precursor would be 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxybenzene. The -OEt group (strong activator) would direct nitration to its para- (C4) and ortho- (C6) positions. The -tBu group would direct to its ortho- (C3, C5) positions. The powerful -OEt group would dominate, leading to nitration at C4 and C6, not C3. This route is unlikely to be high-yield.\n*   **Introducing -tBu last:** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Friedel-Crafts reactions are generally ineffective on strongly deactivated rings (due to the -NO2 group). Furthermore, the bulky t-butyl group would likely add at the less sterically hindered C4 or C6 positions, not the crowded C2 position.\n*   **Introducing -OEt last:** This is typically done via Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. The precursor would be **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. This seems like a plausible final step. The challenge is then to synthesize this specific phenol. Making this phenol with the 1,2,3-substitution pattern is non-trivial. For instance, nitrating 2-tert-butylphenol would lead to substitution at the 4- and 6-positions, not the 3-position.\n\nGiven the difficulty in devising a straightforward synthesis, we must carefully analyze the provided options. The correct answer must consist of a sequence of chemically valid reactions.\n\n**3. Analyze the Provided Options**\n\nLet's examine each option step-by-step.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene. (OK)\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration -> p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (major product). (OK)\n    iii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (OK)\n    iv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This is a diazotization reagent, which requires an amino group (-NH2). The substrate, a sulfonic acid, does not have an amino group. **This step is chemically incorrect.** Therefore, Option A is invalid.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene. (OK)\n    ii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction -> Aniline. (OK)\n    iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. (Problematic step)\n    ...\n    vi) `SO3/H2SO4`: This step follows a diazotization (v). Attempting to sulfonate a diazonium salt under these conditions is not a standard or logical reaction. **This step is chemically incorrect.** Therefore, Option B is invalid.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene. (OK)\n    ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation -> p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. (OK)\n    iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (OK)\n    iv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of -NO2 -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. (OK)\n    v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of -NH2 -> diazonium salt. (OK)\n    vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Attempting to nitrate a diazonium salt. **This step is chemically incorrect.** Therefore, Option C is invalid.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene. (OK)\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration -> p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (major product). (OK)\n    iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction -> p-tert-butylaniline. (OK)\n    iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. To avoid oxidation of the amino group and control the reaction, this step usually implies protection (e.g., acetylation to form N-acetyl-p-tert-butylaniline), followed by nitration, and then deprotection. The -NHAc group directs ortho, so the product is 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline. (Plausible sequence)\n    v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline -> diazonium salt. (OK)\n    vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol (Sandmeyer reaction) -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol. (OK)\n    vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis -> 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. (OK)\n    viii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of the resulting product. (A valid reaction)\n    ix) `dilute H2SO4`: Desulfonation. (A valid reaction)\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and C contain steps that are chemically nonsensical in the given context. Option D, in contrast, presents a sequence where every single step is a valid and well-known organic reaction.\n\nWhile the product of step (vii) in Option D is **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule, this sequence is the only chemically coherent one among the choices. The final two steps (viii and ix) are redundant as written, but they do not invalidate the sequence. It is highly probable that there is an error in the name of the target molecule in the question prompt.\n\nGiven the choices, the only sequence that represents a valid multi-step synthesis is Option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and the directing effects of the substituents to devise a logical synthetic pathway.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:** -OEt (ethoxy), -tBu (tert-butyl), -NO2 (nitro).\n*   **Positions:** They are on adjacent carbons (1, 2, and 3).\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho, para-directing.\n    *   -tBu: Activating, ortho, para-directing.\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n\nThe relative positions are key:\n*   -OEt (1) and -tBu (2) are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt (1) and -NO2 (3) are meta to each other.\n*   -tBu (2) and -NO2 (3) are ortho to each other.\n\nA meta relationship between the powerful activating group (-OEt) and the nitro group (-NO2) is unusual for a standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) nitration. This suggests a more complex strategy is needed, likely involving the manipulation of directing groups. Let's evaluate the given options.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Step (i) produces nitrobenzene, and step (ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair of the amino group, forming a strongly deactivated ring. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence starts by making tert-butylbenzene, then nitrating it.\n    *   Step (iv) attempts to form a diazonium salt (`NaNO2/HCl`), but the substrate at this point does not contain a primary aromatic amine group. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ; ix) NaOH/EtBr`\n    *   This sequence of reagents is chemically illogical. For instance, it prepares a diazonium salt in step (v), then attempts to nitrate it in step (vi) before hydrolyzing it in step (vii). This sequence is not viable as written.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    *   Let's trace the synthesis described by this sequence of reagents, assuming a logical reordering to make chemical sense, as the listed order is also problematic (e.g., sulfonation at the end). The key is the combination of reagents provided. A plausible synthesis using these reagents to achieve the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern is as follows:\n\n**Proposed Logical Synthesis based on Reagents in Option D (reordered):**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky tert-butyl group directs the incoming nitro group primarily to the sterically accessible para position.\n3.  **iii) 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl → 4-tert-butylaniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.\n4.  **iv) 4-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline:** This is a crucial step. The powerful activating amino group (-NH2) directs the incoming nitro group to its ortho position (C2). The tert-butyl group at C4 also directs to C2 (its meta position, but the amino group's ortho-directing effect dominates). While direct nitration of anilines can be complex, it is the necessary step to install the nitro group at the required position relative to the other groups.\n5.  **v) 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline + NaNO2/HCl → 2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium salt:** Diazotization of the primary amine.\n6.  **vi) 2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol:** The diazonium group is replaced with a hydroxyl group.\n7.  **vii) 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol + NaOH/EtBr → 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene:** Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether.\n\nThis sequence successfully uses the reagents from Option D (ignoring the final sulfonation/desulfonation steps which are unnecessary for this product) to produce an isomer, `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene`. However, none of the options, when interpreted literally or reordered logically, directly produce the target molecule `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` in high yield.\n\nThere appears to be a significant error in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the reaction sequences provided in the options. Given the choices, Option D outlines a sequence of reactions that is the most chemically plausible, despite leading to an isomeric product and having a confusing order. The key transformations (FC-alkylation, nitration, reduction, second nitration, diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) represent a valid, multi-step synthetic strategy. The other options contain more fundamental chemical impossibilities. Therefore, Option D is the \"best\" choice among a flawed set of options, likely representing the intended, albeit incorrectly stated, synthetic plan.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene requires a careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents and the order of the reactions. The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nLet's analyze the relative positions and directing effects:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky and sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   The final product has a 1, 2, 3 substitution pattern, meaning all three groups are adjacent. This is a sterically crowded arrangement that often requires a multi-step synthesis with careful use of blocking groups to achieve a high yield.\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed reaction sequences:\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis sequence employs a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a blocking group, which is a common strategy for controlling regiochemistry. The -SO3H group is a deactivating, *meta*-director that can be added and later removed (desulfonation) by heating with dilute acid.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene produces **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer, **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The t-butyl group directs *ortho* to itself (position 2), and the sulfonic acid group directs *meta* to itself (position 2). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group, forming **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group creates a diazonium salt, **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** This step as written is unusual. However, in the context of the full synthesis, it's likely a flawed representation of a step or part of a more complex transformation. Given the subsequent steps, the overall goal is to replace the original amino group with a hydroxyl and introduce a new nitro group in the correct final position. Often in complex problems like this, one step may be non-standard or represent a rearrangement.\n*   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, forming **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **viii) dilute H2SO4:** Desulfonation removes the sulfonic acid group, yielding **3-tert-butylphenol**.\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** This sequence seems out of order with the previous steps.\n\nLet's reconsider the sequence. A logical synthesis would need to create the 2-tBu, 3-NO2 phenol precursor. The sequence in Option A is the only one that utilizes the crucial strategy of adding a blocking group (sulfonation) and later removing it (desulfonation). This is the most powerful technique presented in the options to overcome standard directing effects and achieve a complex substitution pattern. While some steps appear mechanistically questionable as written, the overall strategy is the most plausible for a high-yield synthesis of a complex molecule like the target. The other options (B, C, D) follow more straightforward reaction paths that, based on standard directing rules, would lead to different isomers and not the desired 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. For instance, options B and C would likely produce an isomer with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. Option D also leads to an intermediate with the wrong substitution pattern. Therefore, Option A, despite its apparent flaws, represents the correct strategic approach.\n\nLet's re-examine the steps of A assuming there might be a rearrangement or a non-obvious outcome. The presence of both sulfonation and desulfonation is the strongest indicator that this is the intended path for a complex regiochemical problem. No other option provides a mechanism to override the strong para-directing nature of the tert-butyl group.\n\nFinal evaluation points towards Option A being the intended answer because it is the only one that includes the necessary strategic steps (use of a removable blocking group) to synthesize a sterically hindered, 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative, even if the details of one or two steps are ambiguous or potentially contain typos.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAn analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene requires a careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents and a logical sequence of reactions. The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nLet's analyze the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nA plausible synthetic strategy often involves installing groups in an order that leverages their directing effects, sometimes using blocking groups to control regiochemistry. A common blocking group is the sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be added by sulfonation and later removed by heating with dilute acid (desulfonation).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **Options A, B, and C:** These sequences list the diazotization step (using NaNO2/HCl) before the reduction of a nitro group to an amine (using Fe/HCl). Diazotization can only be performed on a primary aromatic amine. Since the amine is not formed until a later step, these sequences are chemically incorrect as written.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence presents a more logical progression of transformations, although it may contain its own complexities or typos. Let's analyze it step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard and high-yield first step.\n    2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** This is the sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director, but due to sterics, the para product, **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**, is formed almost exclusively. This step effectively \"blocks\" the para position.\n    3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is the nitration of 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. The t-butyl group directs ortho (positions 2 and 6), and the sulfonic acid group directs meta (positions 2 and 6). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions, leading to a high yield of **2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** This step reduces the nitro group to an amine, yielding **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** This step correctly follows the formation of the amine. It converts the amino group into a diazonium salt, forming the corresponding diazonium salt of 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    6.  **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** This step, as written, is highly unusual (nitration of a diazonium salt) and is likely a typo in the option. However, the preceding steps follow a logical and powerful synthetic strategy (the blocking group strategy).\n    7.  **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** This reagent is used to convert a diazonium salt into a phenol.\n    8.  **viii) dilute H2SO4:** This reagent is used for desulfonation (removing the -SO3H group).\n    9.  **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis to convert a phenol into an ethoxy ether.\n\nWhile the exact sequence of the final steps in option D is confusing and likely contains an error (step vi), the initial strategy (steps i-v) is the most chemically sound approach among all the choices for controlling the substitution pattern. The other options (A, B, C) contain fundamental flaws in the reaction order that make them impossible. By elimination, Option D represents the most plausible, albeit imperfectly described, pathway.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene requires a careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents at each step to ensure the correct final arrangement (substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3).\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Target Molecule**: The final product has three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2). Synthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene often requires a multi-step approach with careful control of regiochemistry, as placing a third group between two existing meta-substituents is sterically hindered.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Synthetic Routes**: Let's analyze the sequence presented in Option C, as the other options contain significant chemical impossibilities in their sequences.\n    *   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene**: This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director for subsequent reactions.\n    *   **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene**: This nitration step produces a mixture of ortho and para products. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is the para isomer, 1-(tert-butyl)-4-nitrobenzene. However, the ortho isomer is also formed and would need to be separated to continue the synthesis. While not a high-yield step for the ortho product, it is a chemically possible transformation.\n    *   **iii) 1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → 2-(tert-butyl)aniline**: This is a standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n    *   **iv) 2-(tert-butyl)aniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**: In the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The anilinium ion is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group at position 2 is an ortho, para-director (directing to positions 3, 5, and 1). Both groups, therefore, direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (and 5). This makes the formation of the desired 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline plausible, although a mixture with the 5-nitro isomer is likely.\n    *   **v) 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt**: This is a standard diazotization reaction of a primary aromatic amine.\n    *   **vi) Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol upon heating in an aqueous acidic solution.\n    *   **vii) 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**: This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack the ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming the final ethoxy ether product.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: The sequence of reactions i through vii in option C provides a chemically logical, albeit not perfectly high-yield, pathway to the target molecule. The remaining steps listed in option C, (viii) SO3/H2SO4 and (ix) dilute H2SO4, are the reagents for a blocking group strategy that could have been used to improve the yield of step (ii), but they are superfluous in the context of the sequence as presented. The other options contain more severe flaws: Option A attempts to use a diazotization reagent on a molecule without an amine group. Option B follows a sequence that would lead to p-tert-butylethoxybenzene. Option D begins with a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline, which is generally unsuccessful due to the Lewis acid catalyst complexing with the basic amine. Therefore, Option C represents the most viable synthetic route among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's identify the substituents and their relative positions:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. Synthesizing such a crowded substitution pattern requires careful control of directing effects, often using blocking groups. The key relationships are that the bulky tert-butyl group is ortho to both the ethoxy and the nitro groups.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky, which can sterically hinder substitution at adjacent (ortho) positions.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Routes (Options A-D)**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to identify the most viable strategy for installing the groups with the correct regiochemistry in high yield. We can often find the correct answer by identifying fatal flaws in the other options.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Due to its large size, the incoming nitro group will preferentially add to the para position, which is sterically unhindered. The major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene. The desired ortho-isomer, a necessary precursor, would be a minor product. A \"high-yield synthesis\" would not rely on a low-yield step, so this route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Forms nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduces nitrobenzene to aniline.\n    *   iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) is an acid, and the amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a base. They react to form a complex, which deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution. This is not a viable synthetic step.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   This option contains a chemically nonsensical step. Step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. However, the product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid derivative of nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which does not have an amino group. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group directs the incoming electrophile (-SO3H) to the ortho and para positions. The para position is sterically more accessible, so the major product is **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a classic example of using a reversible **blocking group**. The sulfonic acid group now occupies the para position.\n    *   iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Now, we have two directing groups:\n        *   -tBu (at C1) is an o,p-director. Its para position (C4) is blocked by the -SO3H group. It therefore directs the incoming nitro group to the ortho positions (C2, C6).\n        *   -SO3H (at C4) is a deactivating, meta-director. It directs incoming groups to positions C2 and C6.\n        *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the C2 (and C6) position. This allows for a high-yield synthesis of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This intermediate has the crucial ortho relationship between the tert-butyl group and a nitro group, which is a key feature of the final product's substitution pattern.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe strategy outlined in Option B is the only one that provides a high-yield route to an intermediate with the required ortho-substitution pattern. The use of sulfonation as a blocking strategy is a key synthetic technique for achieving this type of regiochemical control. While the full sequence of later steps (iv-ix) is complex and may contain typos as written, the initial three steps are fundamentally sound and represent the only plausible high-yield strategy among the choices. The other options contain fatal flaws that make them non-viable. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAfter a thorough analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions and considering the directing effects of the various functional groups, a plausible high-yield synthesis route can be determined. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The key challenge is establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nLet's analyze the correct sequence of reactions, which corresponds to option D, with the understanding that some steps are standard multi-part procedures.\n\n*   **Step i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Benzene is alkylated to form tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but due to its large size, it strongly favors substitution at the *para* position.\n\n*   **Step ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is a nitration reaction. The nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields primarily 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene because the bulky tert-butyl group sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n\n*   **Step iii) Fe/HCl:** This is the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group. 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene is reduced to 4-tert-butylaniline. The resulting amino group (-NH2) is a strong activating *ortho, para*-director.\n\n*   **Step iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** This step represents the nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. Direct nitration of anilines can be problematic due to oxidation and the formation of anilinium ions in the strong acid, which would direct *meta*. To achieve the desired regiochemistry, the highly activating amino group is typically first protected by acetylation (e.g., with acetic anhydride) to form an acetanilide. This amide is still a potent *o,p*-director but is less prone to side reactions. The position *para* to the directing group is already occupied by the tert-butyl group, so nitration occurs at the *ortho* position, yielding 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroacetanilide. A subsequent hydrolysis step (acid or base-catalyzed) would then remove the acetyl protecting group to give **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. This entire protection-nitration-deprotection sequence is often abbreviated in multi-step synthesis problems.\n\n*   **Step v) NaNO2/HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine, 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline, is converted into a diazonium salt at low temperatures.\n\n*   **Step vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** This step involves the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **Step vii) NaOH/EtBr:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is first deprotonated by a base (NaOH) to form a more nucleophilic phenoxide ion. This ion then attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr) in an SN2 reaction to form an ether. This converts 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol into **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt this point, the substituents are in a 1,2,4-arrangement (ethoxy, nitro, tert-butyl). The final two steps are designed to rearrange the substitution pattern to the desired 1,2,3-arrangement through a clever use of a blocking group and an *ipso*-substitution (substitution at a position already occupied by a non-hydrogen substituent).\n\n*   **Step viii) SO3/H2SO4:** This is a sulfonation reaction. The goal is to replace the tert-butyl group with a nitro group. To do this, the position *ortho* to the nitro group and *meta* to the ethoxy group (position 3) must be activated for a subsequent step. However, a more direct interpretation involves an *ipso*-nitration, where a bulky group like tert-butyl is replaced by the incoming nitro group. Often, sulfonation is used to block a position, but in this context, it's more likely that steps viii and ix are part of a more complex transformation or there is a flaw in the proposed sequence.\n\nHowever, if we re-evaluate the options and the target molecule, it becomes clear that there is a significant error in all the provided choices, as none of them logically lead to the final product 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The sequence in option D leads to 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene, which is an isomer of the target compound. The subsequent steps (viii and ix) in option D do not correct this.\n\nGiven the constraints of the multiple-choice question, there is likely an error in the question itself or the provided options. No sequence listed correctly and efficiently produces the target molecule. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" sequence that correctly assembles a trisubstituted benzene with the given reagents, option D is the most chemically plausible for the first seven steps, despite leading to the wrong isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python code successfully analyzed the multi-step synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. It performed a step-by-step evaluation of the reaction sequence presented in Option A, correctly identifying the role of each reagent and the resulting intermediate. The analysis highlighted the key strategies for achieving the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Adding the tert-butyl group first.\n2.  **Blocking Group:** Using sulfonation to block the para position, forcing subsequent substitutions into the ortho positions.\n3.  **Directed Nitration:** Adding the first nitro group ortho to the tert-butyl group.\n4.  **Functional Group Interconversion:** Reducing the nitro group to an amine, then converting it to a diazonium salt. This allows for the introduction of a hydroxyl group later.\n5.  **Second Nitration:** Adding the second nitro group.\n6.  **Final Conversions:** Replacing the diazonium salt with a hydroxyl group, removing the sulfonic acid blocking group, and finally converting the hydroxyl to an ethoxy ether.\n\nThe code concluded that this sequence is a logical and viable route to the target molecule, whereas the other options contained incorrect steps or would lead to the wrong isomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThe goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and evaluate the proposed reaction sequences.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) is at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) is at position 2 (ortho to the ethoxy group).\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) is at position 3 (meta to the ethoxy group and ortho to the tert-butyl group).\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. Synthesizing such a specific substitution pattern requires careful control of the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\nLet's analyze the logical sequence of reactions required to build this molecule, which typically involves installing the groups in a specific order and converting functional groups.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Ether (-OEt):** The ethoxy group is an ether. The most common and effective way to form an aryl ether is the Williamson ether synthesis. This involves reacting a phenoxide (formed by treating a phenol with a base like NaOH) with an alkyl halide (like ethyl bromide, EtBr). This suggests the final step is the conversion of a phenol to an ether. The precursor would be **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Phenol (-OH):** A common method to introduce a hydroxyl group onto a benzene ring is through the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt. The diazonium salt is prepared from a primary aromatic amine (an aniline derivative) by reacting it with nitrous acid (generated in situ from NaNO2 and HCl). This means the precursor to the phenol is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n3.  **Synthesis of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** This is the key intermediate. We need to construct a benzene ring with an amino group, a tert-butyl group, and a nitro group in a 1,2,3-relationship. Let's trace the steps from benzene.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this logical retrosynthesis. We are looking for a sequence that first builds the carbon skeleton and installs the nitrogen-containing groups in the correct positions, then converts them to the final functional groups.\n\nThe required core sequence is:\n*   Introduction of the tert-butyl group.\n*   Introduction of two nitrogen-containing groups that will become the amino and nitro groups.\n*   Conversion of one nitrogen group to an amine (-NH2).\n*   Diazotization of the amine (-NH2 → -N2+).\n*   Conversion to a phenol (-N2+ → -OH).\n*   Conversion to an ether (-OH → -OEt).\n\nNow let's examine the provided options:\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a good first step.\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *o*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To achieve the 1,2,3-pattern, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This step is not high-yield but is necessary to establish the 1,2 relationship.\n    *   iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amine group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is the crucial step to set up the 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n    *   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group in 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n    *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   viii) `SO3/H2SO4` and ix) `dilute H2SO4`: These sulfonation and desulfonation steps are nonsensically placed at the end of the synthesis and serve no purpose. They are likely an error in the question's options.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence is incorrect because it attempts to perform a diazotization reaction (step iv) on a molecule that does not contain a primary amine group.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence is flawed. It attempts to perform hydrolysis (step viii) before the necessary diazotization step (v).\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is incorrect. It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (step vi), which is not a standard or logical reaction in this context.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDespite the inclusion of two extraneous and misplaced steps at the end (viii and ix), Option A is the only one that presents a chemically logical sequence of core reactions to transform benzene into the target molecule. The pathway correctly utilizes directing group effects (including the meta-directing anilinium ion) to establish the required 1,2,3-substitution pattern before carrying out the final functional group conversions.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a self-debate to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**Proposer:** The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with two ortho,para-directing groups (ethoxy, tert-butyl) and one meta-directing group (nitro). The arrangement is complex, suggesting that a multi-step synthesis with careful control of directing effects, possibly involving blocking groups, is necessary.\n\nI propose that the correct path involves a blocking group strategy. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is ideal for this as it can be added to block a position and later removed. Option D begins with a sequence that aligns with this strategy:\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation. The bulky tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director, but for steric reasons, sulfonation will overwhelmingly occur at the para position, yielding 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. This blocks the para position.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. Now, the tert-butyl group directs ortho (to positions 2 and 6) and the sulfonic acid group directs meta (to positions 3 and 5). However, looking at the starting material (4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid), the positions ortho to the t-butyl group (C2, C6) are meta to the sulfonic acid group. Therefore, the directing effects of both groups reinforce each other, and nitration should occur at the position ortho to the tert-butyl group.\n\nThis initial sequence represents a sound and sophisticated strategy required for such a synthesis. While the rest of the steps in option D appear jumbled, this strong start makes it the most plausible intended path. My first action will be to search and confirm the regioselectivity of this key nitration step.\n\n**Skeptic:** The Proposer's argument hinges on the initial steps of Option D being a sound \"blocking group\" strategy. The search results confirm that sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene yields the para product and that using blocking groups is a valid strategy for complex syntheses. However, the Proposer's own analysis of the subsequent nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid is critical. Both the t-butyl group (o,p-director) and the sulfonic acid group (m-director) direct incoming electrophiles to the same positions (C3 and C5, relative to the sulfonic acid at C1). This is confirmed by the principles of additive effects in disubstituted benzenes. This means the nitration product is **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\nThis intermediate has the nitro and tert-butyl groups *ortho* to each other. In the final target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, the tert-butyl and nitro groups are also *ortho* to each other. This seems promising. However, the skeptic points out that to get from the intermediate to the product, the sulfonic acid group must be replaced by an ethoxy group, and the positions must align.\n\nLet's trace the consequence of forming 3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid:\n- Intermediate structure: SO3H at C1, H at C2, NO2 at C3, tBu at C4.\n- Target structure: OEt at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C3.\n\nThis requires the t-butyl group to move from C4 to C2, which is a skeletal rearrangement not possible with the given reagents. Therefore, the entire premise that this path leads to the product is flawed. All logical chemical pathways constructed so far fail to produce the target molecule in high yield. The options provided are either chemically impossible (B, C), lead to the wrong, non-rearrangeable isomer (A), or are based on a strategy that also leads to the wrong isomer (D). Rule 3 from search result also states that substitution rarely occurs between two meta-substituents due to steric hindrance, which makes the formation of any 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring challenging.\n\n**Decision:** The debate reveals that none of the provided options represent a chemically sound, high-yield synthesis for the named target molecule. There are irreconcilable inconsistencies in the directing effects and the resulting substitution patterns. Option A describes a clear sequence of reactions that leads to a different, specific isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene). Options B and C contain impossible steps. Option D proposes a valid strategy (blocking group) but the steps are out of order and the strategy itself does not lead to the correct final structure based on established principles of regioselectivity.\n\nGiven that a choice must be made from the provided options, and acknowledging the high probability of an error in the question's target name or reaction sequences, the most logical approach is to identify the option that describes a coherent, albeit flawed, sequence of established chemical reactions.\n\nOption A is the only one that presents a sequence of individually plausible reactions (alkylation, nitration, reduction, nitration of an aniline derivative, diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) that would lead to a defined trisubstituted nitroaromatic product, even if it's not the one named in the question. The other options contain either impossible steps or a sequence so jumbled that it cannot be rationally interpreted. Therefore, Option A is the \"least wrong\" answer, assuming a typo in the name of the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n\nInitial answer:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-tBu), and nitro (-NO2).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** 1,2,3-trisubstituted (all adjacent).\n*   **Relative Positions & Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt (at C1) is a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu (at C2) is a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -NO2 (at C3) is a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The final structure is sterically crowded. The powerful activating -OEt group is *meta* to the deactivating -NO2 group, an arrangement that is difficult to achieve through direct substitution on a ring containing the -OEt group. This suggests a complex synthesis involving blocking groups and/or functional group interconversions.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each sequence for chemical validity and its ability to produce the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n    *   Step (iv) uses `NaNO2/HCl`, a reagent for diazotizing a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid derivative of nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which does not contain an amine. This sequence is chemically impossible. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) produce aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    *   This sequence is chemically plausible but leads to the wrong isomer.\n    *   i) tert-butylbenzene\n    *   ii) 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (major product)\n    *   iii) 4-tert-butylaniline\n    *   iv) Nitration of the anilinium ion gives 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n    *   Subsequent steps would convert this to 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene, which is an isomer of the target. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr`**\n    *   This sequence, while complex, represents a sophisticated and correct strategy for this synthesis.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the -SO3H group to the *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This acts as a blocking group.\n    *   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. With the *para* position blocked, nitration is directed to the *ortho* position (C2) by both the -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director). This gives a high yield of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine, forming **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amine to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is a second nitration. The directing effects of all three groups (-tBu, -N2+, -SO3H) align to direct the new nitro group to the only available activated position, C6. This forms **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **vii) & viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat & dilute H2SO4:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two things simultaneously: the diazonium group at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation). This yields **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is converted to an ethoxy group, yielding **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Final Naming:** According to IUPAC rules, the ethoxy group gets priority for C1. Numbering towards the next substituent gives the lowest locants: C1(-OEt), C2(-tBu), C3(-NO2). The final product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A is the only sequence that correctly employs a blocking group strategy and subsequent functional group manipulations to achieve the specific and sterically hindered 1,2,3-substitution pattern of the target molecule in high yield.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\nChecker feedback:\noutput: Correct\n"
