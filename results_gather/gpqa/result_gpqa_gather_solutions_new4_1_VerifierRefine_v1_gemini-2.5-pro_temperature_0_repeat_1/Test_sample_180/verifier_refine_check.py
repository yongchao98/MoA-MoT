def check_neutrino_flux_ratio():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the solar neutrino flux problem.

    The problem asks for the approximate ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands,
    Flux(700-800 keV) / Flux(800-900 keV), under the hypothetical condition that
    the pp-III branch of solar fusion has stopped.

    This code verifies the logic by:
    1. Using standard values for the relevant neutrino fluxes (⁷Be and CNO).
    2. Calculating the flux in each band according to the problem's constraints.
    3. Computing the ratio.
    4. Comparing the computed ratio to the provided answer's value.
