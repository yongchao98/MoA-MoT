    """
    This function calculates the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a specific Schr√∂dinger cat state
    and compares it to the expected answer from the analysis.

    The calculation follows these steps:
    1. The non-Gaussianity nG = S(tau) - S(rho). Since rho is a pure state, S(rho) = 0, so nG = S(tau).
    2. The reference Gaussian state tau has the same first and second moments as rho.
    3. For the given state (phi=-pi/4, alpha=0.5), it's an "odd cat state".
       - First moment <a> = 0.
       - Second moments are <a^2> = alpha^2 and <n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2).
    4. The entropy S(tau) is calculated from the symplectic eigenvalue 'nu'.
       - nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2
       - S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)
