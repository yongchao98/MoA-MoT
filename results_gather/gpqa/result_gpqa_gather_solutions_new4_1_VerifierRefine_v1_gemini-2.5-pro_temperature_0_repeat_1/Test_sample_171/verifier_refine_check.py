    This function programmatically verifies the derivation for the relationship
    between the temperatures of the two stars based on the Boltzmann equation.

    The problem states:
    1. The system is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann equation applies.
       The excitation ratio R is proportional to exp(-ΔE / (k * T)).
    2. The excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2: R_1 = 2 * R_2.
    3. The energy difference ΔE is approximately equal to the Boltzmann constant k (since ΔE/k ≈ 1).

    The function will:
    1. Set up the initial equation from the problem statement using symbolic variables.
    2. Algebraically solve for ln(2).
    3. Substitute the condition ΔE/k = 1.
    4. Compare the final derived expression to the expression given in option A.
