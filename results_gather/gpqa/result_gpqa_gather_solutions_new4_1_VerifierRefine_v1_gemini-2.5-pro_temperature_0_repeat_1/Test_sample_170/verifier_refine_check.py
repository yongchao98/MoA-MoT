    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for an organic chemistry question.
    The question asks to arrange 6 substituted benzenes in order of increasing para-isomer yield
    during electrophilic bromination.

    The function verifies the answer based on established chemical principles:
    1.  Directing effects of substituents (meta vs. ortho/para).
    2.  Relative strength of deactivating groups for meta-directors.
    3.  Steric and electronic effects influencing the para/ortho ratio for ortho/para-directors.

    #
    # Meta-directors (low yield):
    # -NO2 is the strongest deactivator -> lowest para yield (Rank 1).
    # -COOH is a strong deactivator -> very low para yield (Rank 2).
    # -COOC2H5 is a strong deactivator, slightly weaker than -COOH -> low para yield (Rank 3).
    #
    # Ortho/para-directors (high yield):
    # -CH3 (Toluene): Para yield is ~66% (Rank 4).
    # -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Bulkier than -CH3, so higher para yield (~70%) (Rank 5).
    # -Cl (Chlorobenzene): High para-selectivity due to electronic/steric effects (~87%) (Rank 6).
