    Checks the correctness of the answer for the quasar redshift problem.

    The core logic is to calculate the minimum redshift (z) required to shift
    the Lyman-alpha line (1216 Å) past the Earth's atmospheric UV cutoff.
    The question's correctness hinges on the interpretation of "lower limit",
    which points to the physical atmospheric cutoff (~3500 Å) rather than
    a practical/visible cutoff (~4000 Å).
