    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.

    **1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons**
    First, sum the integrations of all signals to find the total number of protons in the molecule:
    1H (at 7.0 ppm) + 1H (at 5.5 ppm) + 3H (at 2.1 ppm) + 3H (at 1.6 ppm) = **8 protons**.

    Next, let's check the number of protons in the possible structures:
    *   **Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** The structure is CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₃. The number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8. This matches the data.
    *   **Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** The structure would be, for example, CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃. The number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 10. This does not match the data.

    **Careful Point 1:** Based on the total proton count, we can immediately eliminate the butenyl acetate options (A and B). The compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.

    **2. Analyze Each Signal Individually**
    We are now deciding between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.

    *   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**
        *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (CH₃) group.
        *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** This means the protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.
        *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This is the characteristic region for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), specifically an acetate group (CH₃-COO-). This is consistent with a propenyl acetate structure.

    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**
        *   **Integration (3H):** Represents another methyl group.
        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This means the methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1 rule: 1+1=2 peaks). This is consistent with the CH₃-CH= fragment.

    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**
        *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.
        *   **Chemical Shift (~5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region (a proton on a C=C double bond).
        *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors. The 'd' (doublet) comes from coupling to one other proton (the other vinylic proton). The 'q' (quartet) comes from coupling to three protons (the methyl group at 1.6 ppm). This perfectly describes the proton in the =CH-CH₃ fragment.

    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**
        *   **Integration (1H):** Represents the other vinylic proton.
        *   **Chemical Shift (~7.0 ppm):** This is also a vinylic proton. Its high chemical shift (downfield) is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom from the acetate group (-O-CH=).
        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** It is coupled to only one other proton (the one at 5.5 ppm).
        *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most critical piece of information for determining the stereochemistry.

    **3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**
    **Careful Point 2:** The magnitude of the coupling constant (J-value) between two protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their geometry.
    *   **Trans-protons:** Have a large coupling constant, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.
    *   **Cis-protons:** Have a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.

    The observed coupling constant is **16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.

    **Conclusion**
    The analysis of the proton count and splitting patterns confirms the structure is **propenyl acetate**. The large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz between the vinylic protons proves that they are in a **trans** relationship. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.
