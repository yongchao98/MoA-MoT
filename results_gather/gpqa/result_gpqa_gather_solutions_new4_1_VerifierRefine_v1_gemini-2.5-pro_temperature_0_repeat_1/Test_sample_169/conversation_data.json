So we need to calculate:\n`<S_y> = <χ|S_y|χ> / <χ|χ>`\n\n**Step 2: Define the State Vector (ket) and its Conjugate Transpose (bra)**\n\n*   The given spin state is `(3i, 4)`. In column vector (ket) notation, this is:\n    `|χ> = [ 3i ]`\n    `      [ 4  ]`\n*   The corresponding bra vector, `<χ|`, is the conjugate transpose of `|χ>`.\n    1.  Transpose `|χ>`: `[3i, 4]`\n    2.  Take the complex conjugate of each element: `[-3i, 4]`\n    So, `<χ| = [-3i, 4]`\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to forget to take the complex conjugate when forming the bra vector. Remember that `(i)* = -i`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Normalization Factor `<χ|χ>`**\n\nThis is the denominator in our expectation value formula.\n`<χ|χ> = [-3i, 4] * [ 3i ]`\n`                  [ 4  ]`\n`<χ|χ> = (-3i)*(3i) + (4)*(4)`\n`<χ|χ> = -9i² + 16`\nSince `i² = -1`, we have:\n`<χ|χ> = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n**Careful Point:** The inner product of a state with itself, `<ψ|ψ>`, must always be a real, non-negative number. Our result of 25 confirms this.\n\n**Step 4: Define the Operator `S_y`**\n\nThe spin operator `S` is related to the Pauli matrices `σ` by `S = (ħ/2)σ`.\nTherefore, `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`.\nUsing the given `σ_y` matrix:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ]`\n`            [ i   0 ]`\n\n**Careful Point:** Do not forget the `ħ/2` factor. The Pauli matrices themselves are dimensionless, but the spin operator has units of angular momentum.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Numerator `<χ|S_y|χ>`**\n\nTo make the calculation easier, we first compute the action of the operator on the ket, `S_y|χ>`.\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ]`\n`            [ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ (0)*(3i) + (-i)*(4) ]`\n`            [ (i)*(3i) + (0)*(4)  ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`            [ 3i² ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`            [ -3  ]`\n\nNow, we multiply this result by the bra `<χ|`:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\nLet's pull the constant `(ħ/2)` to the front:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( [-3i, 4] * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( (-3i)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3) )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( 12i² - 12 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( -12 - 12 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( -24 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = -12ħ`\n\n**Careful Point:** Be very careful with the matrix multiplication and the arithmetic involving the imaginary unit `i`.\n\n**Step 6: Assemble the Final Answer**\n\nNow we combine the numerator and the denominator to find the expectation value:\n`<S_y> = <χ|S_y|χ> / <χ|χ>`\n`<S_y> = -12ħ / 25`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step derivation to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, $\\langle S_y \\rangle$.\n\n**1.

The Formula for Expectation Value**\n\nThe expectation value of an operator (like $S_y$) for a given quantum state ($|\\psi\\rangle$) is calculated using the formula:\n$\\langle S_y \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle \\psi | S_y | \\psi \\rangle}{\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle}$\n\nThe denominator $\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle$ is the normalization factor.

Normalize the state vector**\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the state vector `|ψ>`. The normalization factor `N` is found by calculating the inner product `<ψ|ψ>`.\n\nThe given state vector (ket) is:\n`|ψ> = [3i, 4]`\n\nThe corresponding bra vector is the conjugate transpose of the ket:\n`<ψ| = [-3i, 4]`\n\nNow, calculate the inner product `<ψ|ψ>`:\n`<ψ|ψ> = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]`\n`<ψ|ψ> = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n`<ψ|ψ> = -9i² + 16`\nSince `i² = -1`:\n`<ψ|ψ> = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\nThe normalized state vector `|ψ_norm>` is `|ψ> / sqrt(<ψ|ψ>)`. However, for calculating the expectation value using the formula `<A> = <ψ|A|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`, we can use the unnormalized state and divide by `<ψ|ψ>` at the end, which is what was done in the initial reasoning.\n\n**2. Define the Spin Operator `S_y`**\n\nThe spin operator `S_y` is related to the Pauli matrix `σ_y` by:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`\n\nGiven `σ_y`:\n`σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\nSo, the spin operator is:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n**3. Calculate the Expectation Value `<S_y>`**\n\nThe formula for the expectation value is:\n`<S_y> = <ψ|S_y|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\n\nWe have already calculated the denominator `<ψ|ψ> = 25`.

So we need to calculate:\n`<S_y> = <χ|S_y|χ> / <χ|χ>`\n\n**Step 2: Define the State Vector (ket) and its Conjugate Transpose (bra)**\n\n*   The given spin state is `(3i, 4)`. In column vector (ket) notation, this is:\n    `|χ> = [ 3i ]`\n    `      [ 4  ]`\n*   The corresponding bra vector, `<χ|`, is the conjugate transpose of `|χ>`.\n    1.  Transpose `|χ>`: `[3i, 4]`\n    2.  Take the complex conjugate of each element: `[-3i, 4]`\n    So, `<χ| = [-3i, 4]`\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to forget to take the complex conjugate when forming the bra vector.

Calculate the Numerator `<χ|S_y|χ>`**\nFirst, we apply the operator `S_y` to the ket `|χ>`:\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ]`\n`                 [ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ]`\n`                 [ (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`                 [ 3i² ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`                 [ -3  ]`\n\nNext, we multiply this result by the bra `<χ|`:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\nWe can pull the constant `(ħ/2)` to the front:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( [-3i, 4] * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( 12i² - 12 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( -12 - 12 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( -24 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = -12ħ`\n\n**6.

If not, you must divide by the inner product `<ψ|ψ>`. Forgetting this is a common error.\n2.  **Bra Vector:** Remember that the bra is the **conjugate** transpose. The complex number `3i` becomes `-3i`.\n3.  **Operator Form:** The spin operator `S_y` includes the factor `ħ/2`. Do not just use the Pauli matrix `σ_y`.\n4.  **Complex Arithmetic:** Be meticulous with calculations involving `i`, especially `i² = -1` and signs during multiplication.

The process of normalization ensures that the total probability of finding the electron in any possible spin state is equal to 1. The unnormalized state is represented as a column vector:\n\n|ψ⟩ = [ 3i ]\n      [ 4  ]\n\nTo normalize this state, we first calculate the inner product of the state with itself, which is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of its components. The \"bra\" vector, ⟨ψ|, is the conjugate transpose of the \"ket\" vector |ψ⟩, so ⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4].\n\nThe inner product ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ is:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25\n\nThe normalization constant is the reciprocal of the square root of this value, which is 1/√25 = 1/5. The normalized spin state is therefore:\n\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) * [ 3i ]\n                   [ 4  ]\n\nNext, we use the operator for the spin in the y-direction, S_y.

Taking the conjugate transpose of the state vector `|ψ⟩`.\n2.  Performing the matrix-vector multiplication `S_y|ψ⟩`.\n3.  Calculating the final inner product, especially with the complex numbers and the `ħ/2` factor.\n4.
