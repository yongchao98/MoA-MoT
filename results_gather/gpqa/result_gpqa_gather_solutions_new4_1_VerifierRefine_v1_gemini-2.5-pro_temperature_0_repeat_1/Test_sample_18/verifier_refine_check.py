    # --- Step 1: Determine the correct product for Reaction A ---
    # Reaction: methyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate + (NaOEt, 2,4-dimethyl-1-(vinylsulfinyl)benzene)
    # Analysis:
    # 1. Nucleophile Formation: The substrate is a beta-keto ester. The proton on the carbon
    #    between the two carbonyl groups (C1) is the most acidic (pKa ~11). The base (NaOEt)
    #    will deprotonate this C1 position to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.
    # 2. Michael Addition: This enolate attacks the beta-carbon of the vinylsulfinyl acceptor.
    # 3. Conclusion: The new substituent is added at the C1 position.
    # Therefore, the product name must start with "methyl 1-(...)".

    # --- Step 2: Determine the correct product for Reaction B ---
    # Reaction: ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate + (NaH, methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate)
    # Analysis:
    # 1. Nucleophile Formation: The base (NaH) deprotonates the alpha-carbon of ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate.
    # 2. Michael Addition: The resulting enolate attacks the beta-carbon of the acceptor (the sp2 carbon
    #    in the cyclopentane ring).
    # 3. Product Structure: A new C-C bond connects the alpha-carbon of the butanoate to the
    #    cyclopentane ring. The carbon on the ring is now bonded to both the butanoate moiety
    #    and the phenylacetate moiety.
    # 4. Naming: A "succinate" derivative has a different carbon backbone and is incorrect for this reaction.
    #    The correct name describes a substituted butanoate.
