    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer regarding the number of optically active compounds.

    1. Defining the correct optical activity status for each compound based on established chemical principles.
    2. Calculating the correct total number of optically active compounds.
    3. Comparing this correct count with the count and final option provided by the LLM.
