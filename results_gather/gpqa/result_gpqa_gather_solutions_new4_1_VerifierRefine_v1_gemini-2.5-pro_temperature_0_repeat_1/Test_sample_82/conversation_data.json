The search results confirm the methodologies used:\n\n1.  **pH at 25% Titration**: This point is in the buffer region of the titration. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), is the correct formula to use. At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), meaning the ratio of [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75 or 1/3. The pKa is calculated as -log(Ka).\n\n2.  **pH at the Equivalence Point**: At this point, all the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate base. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base (acetate) in water, which produces OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic (pH > 7). The calculation involves:\n    *   Finding the concentration of the conjugate base.\n    *   Calculating Kb from Ka using the equation Kb = Kw / Ka.\n    *   Setting up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction (Kb = [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]) to find the [OH⁻].\n    *   Calculating pOH from [OH⁻] and then finding the pH (pH = 14 - pOH). This entire process is confirmed by the titration guides.\n\nThe value for Ka of acetic acid is consistently cited as 1.8 x 10⁻⁵. The problem provides 1.85 x 10⁻⁵, which I have used.\n\nThe steps and formulas I've used are validated by the search results. I will proceed with the final answer based on my calculations.\n\n**Summary of Calculations:**\n*   **Diluted Acetic Acid Concentration:** (20.00 cm³ * 0.05 M) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n*   **pKa:** -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **pH at 25% Titration:** pH = pKa + log(25/75) = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.26\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid:** 0.025 M * 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **Volume of NaOH at Equivalence:** 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³\n*   **Total Volume at Equivalence:** 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of Acetate [A⁻] at Equivalence:** 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Kb for Acetate:** (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **[OH⁻] at Equivalence:** √([A⁻] * Kb) = √(0.02 * 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **pOH at Equivalence:** -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   **pH at Equivalence:** 14 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.

Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial Molarity (M₁) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the final molarity (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This creates a buffer solution where the ratio of [A⁻] to [HA] is 25:75 or 1:3.\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH of a buffer solution.\n*   pH = pKa + log ([A⁻]/[HA])\n\nFirst, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nNow, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n*   pH = 4.733 + log(25/75) = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n*   The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to sodium acetate. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (A⁻), a weak base.\n\nFirst, determine the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol.\n*   Volume of NaOH added = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   Total volume of the solution = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\nNext, calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] resulting from the hydrolysis of acetate:\n*   The reaction is: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. Kb = Kw / Ka\n*   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   The equilibrium expression is Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻]. Assuming [HA] ≈ [OH⁻] and [A⁻] remains 0.02 M, we get:\n    Kb ≈ [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]\n*   [OH⁻]² = Kb × [A⁻] = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n*   [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nFinally, calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n*   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n*   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 and pH ≈ 8.52. This matches option B.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>Here is the step-by-step calculation for the pH at the two specified points of the titration.\n\n### 1. Concentration of Acetic Acid after Dilution\n\nFirst, we calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid solution after being diluted with water.\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n\nUsing the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the final concentration (M₂) is:\nM₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt the point of 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). The remaining 75% is still acetic acid. This mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base forms a buffer solution.\n\nTo find the pH of this buffer, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n**pH = pKa + log ([A⁻]/[HA])**\n\nFirst, we calculate the pKa from the given acid dissociation constant (Ka = 1.85x10⁻⁵):\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nAt 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid, [A⁻]/[HA], is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3. Now, we can calculate the pH:\n*   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n*   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n*   pH ≈ 4.256\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate. The pH of the solution is now determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (A⁻), which is a weak base and reacts with water to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n\n**Step 1: Find the concentration of the acetate ion.**\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   To reach the equivalence point, an equal number of moles of NaOH is required: 0.001 mol.\n*   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH added = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Total volume of the solution at the equivalence point = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻].**\n*   The hydrolysis reaction is: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻.\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which is found using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) and the Ka of acetic acid: Kb = Kw / Ka.\n*   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Using the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis, Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻], which simplifies to Kb ≈ [OH⁻]² / [A⁻], we can solve for [OH⁻].\n*   [OH⁻]² = Kb × [A⁻] = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹.\n*   [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH.**\n*   First, find the pOH: pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n*   Then, find the pH: pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point ≈ **8.52**\n\nThese values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe initial calculations seem correct. The search results confirm the methodology.\n\n*   **For 25% titration:** This point is in the buffer region. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), is the correct formula to use. At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base [A⁻] to weak acid [HA] is 25/75 or 1/3. The calculation was pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3) ≈ 4.26. This is a standard application of the equation.\n\n*   **For the equivalence point:** At this point, all the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has been converted to its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). The solution is effectively a solution of sodium acetate. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is a weak base. The steps are:\n    1.  Calculate the total volume and the concentration of the acetate ion.\n    2.  Calculate Kb for the acetate ion using the formula Kb = Kw / Ka.\n    3.  Set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis of acetate (CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻) to find the [OH⁻].\n    4.  Calculate pOH from [OH⁻].\n    5.

Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume after adding water (V₂): 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n\nUsing the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\nM₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the titration is performed on a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid (HA) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻).

The pH of the solution is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base.\n\n**Step 1: Find the volume of NaOH required.**\n*   Moles of acetic acid = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol.\n*   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion.**\n*   Total volume of the solution = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of acetate.**\nThe hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\nWe need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion, which can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid and the ion-product constant for water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C).\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow, we set up an equilibrium expression to find the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH⁻]:\nKb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\nSince Kb is very small, we can approximate that 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\nx² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\nx = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n**Step 4: Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n*   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n*   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the **pH is 8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of 4.26 at 25% titration and a pH of 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nThe initial solution of acetic acid is diluted with an equal volume of water.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Final volume after adding water (V₂): 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n\nUsing the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, we can find the new concentration (M₂):\nM₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂\nM₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³\nM₂ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\nThe reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\nFirst, find the moles of acetic acid to be titrated:\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.00100 mol\n\nAt the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH.\n*   Moles of NaOH = 0.00100 mol\n\nNow, find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required (V_eq):\n*   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.0 mL\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, we have added 25% of the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.\n*   Volume of NaOH added = 0.25 × 10.0 mL = 2.50 mL\n\nAt this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acetic acid remains. This creates a buffer solution.

We need Kb.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Calculate the [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis equilibrium:\n    Kb ≈ [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]\n    [OH⁻]² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × (0.02) = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point ≈ **8.52**\n\nThis pair of values, (4.26; 8.52), corresponds to option C.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while most agents correctly performed the calculation, many made errors when matching their numerical result to the lettered options. The agents that correctly performed the calculation and correctly identified the corresponding option (e.g., Answers 3, 4, 9, 17) all concluded that C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\nChecker feedback:\noutput: Correct\n"
