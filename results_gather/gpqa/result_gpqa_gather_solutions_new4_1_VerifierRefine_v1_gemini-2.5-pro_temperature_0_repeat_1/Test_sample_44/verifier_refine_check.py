    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # System: 4 identical spin-1/2 particles (fermions).
    # Potential: 1D infinite potential well.
    # Single-particle energy: E_n = n^2 * E, for n = 1, 2, 3, ...
    # Constraint: Pauli Exclusion Principle allows a maximum of 2 particles per energy level 'n'.

    # --- Calculation ---
    # We need to find the configurations of 4 particles in the energy levels that result in the
    # three lowest unique total energies.

    # To find the states systematically, we can generate combinations of levels.
    # We create a pool of available single-particle spatial states, considering each
    # level can be occupied twice (for spin up and spin down).
    # Checking levels up to n=5 is sufficient to find the first few system states.
