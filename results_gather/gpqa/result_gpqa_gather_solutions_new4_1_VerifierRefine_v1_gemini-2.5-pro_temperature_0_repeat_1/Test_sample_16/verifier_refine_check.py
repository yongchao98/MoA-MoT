    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the chemistry problem.

    The problem is to find the concentration of calcium ions [Ca²⁺] in a solution
    containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, given a formation constant (Kf) of 5x10^10.

    The dissociation reaction is: [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻
    The dissociation constant Kd = 1 / Kf.
    The equilibrium expression is Kd = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻].

    Let x = [Ca²⁺] at equilibrium. Then [EDTA⁴⁻] = x and [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x.
    So, Kd = x² / (0.02 - x).

    Since Kf is very large, Kd is very small, and we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.
    This simplifies to Kd ≈ x² / 0.02, or x ≈ sqrt(Kd * 0.02).
