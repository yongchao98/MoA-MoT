    # --- Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1 to determine Product A ---
    # Reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+) ---> A
    # Analysis:
    # - The starting material is a 3-hydroxy-1,5-diene, the classic substrate for an oxy-Cope rearrangement.
    # - The reagent KH (a strong base) deprotonates the alcohol, initiating an "anionic" oxy-Cope rearrangement, which is much faster than the neutral version.
    # - The [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement is driven by the relief of ring strain from the 4-membered ring.
    # - The rearrangement of the spiro[3.5]nonane system leads to a bridged bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane skeleton.
    # - The acidic workup (H+) protonates the intermediate enolate, which tautomerizes to the stable ketone.
    # - A molecular formula check confirms this transformation:
    #   - Start (C11H16O) is an isomer of the product.
    #   - (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one has formula C11H16O.
    #   - The alternative, decahydro-7H-benzo[7]annulen-7-one, has formula C11H18O and is not an isomer.

    # --- Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2 to determine Product B ---
    # Reaction: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) ---> B
    # Analysis:
    # - The reagents (allylic alcohol, acylating agent, strong base LDA) are characteristic of the Ireland-Claisen rearrangement.
    # - The mechanism involves in-situ esterification, followed by deprotonation at the alpha-carbon of the acetyl group to form a lithium enolate.
    # - This enolate undergoes a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement to yield a carboxylate.
    # - A crucial point is the final state of the product. The reaction uses a lithium base (LDA) and the problem does NOT specify a final acidic workup step (unlike reaction 1).
    # - Therefore, the acidic product remains deprotonated as its lithium salt.
