def check_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the electron microscope mean free path problem.

    The problem compares two mean free paths (MFP):
    - λ1: MFP of gas molecules colliding with each other.
    - λ2: MFP of high-energy electrons colliding with gas molecules.

    The general formula for MFP is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where:
    - n = number density of target particles
    - σ = collision cross-section

    The number density 'n' is constant in both scenarios.
    """

    # --- Step 1: Define the formulas based on kinetic theory ---
    # For λ1 (gas-gas), we must account for the relative motion of all molecules.
    # This introduces a factor of sqrt(2) in the denominator.
    # So, λ1 is proportional to 1 / (sqrt(2) * σ_gg), where σ_gg is the gas-gas cross-section.
    
    # For λ2 (electron-gas), the electrons are much faster than the gas molecules,
    # so the molecules are considered stationary targets. The sqrt(2) factor is absent.
    # So, λ2 is proportional to 1 / σ_eg, where σ_eg is the electron-gas cross-section.

    # The ratio λ2 / λ1 can be derived as:
    # λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]
    # λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * σ_gg) / σ_eg
    
    # Let's define the ratio of the cross-sections
    # cross_section_ratio = σ_gg / σ_eg

    # So, the final relationship is:
    # ratio_lambda2_lambda1 = math.sqrt(2) * cross_section_ratio

    # --- Step 2: Establish the physical constraint on the cross-sections ---
    # This is the most critical physical insight.
    # σ_gg (gas-gas): This is a kinetic cross-section based on the physical size of the molecules.
    # σ_eg (electron-gas): This is a scattering cross-section. For very high-energy (1000 keV)
    # electrons, the atom is mostly empty space and the electron is highly penetrating.
    # The probability of a significant scattering event is low, making the effective
    # cross-section σ_eg much SMALLER than the kinetic cross-section σ_gg.
    
    # Therefore, the physical constraint is: σ_gg > σ_eg
    # This means the cross_section_ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) must be greater than 1.
    # Let's check the logic based on this constraint.
    cross_section_ratio_is_greater_than_1 = True

        # This would correspond to the reasoning in answers like 1, 4, 9, and 14, which incorrectly
        # assume the long-range Coulomb force leads to a larger cross-section for high-energy electrons.
        return "Incorrect premise: The reasoning that σ_eg > σ_gg is flawed for high-energy (1000 keV) electrons. At such energies, the scattering cross-section is significantly smaller than the kinetic cross-section, not larger."

    # --- Step 3: Evaluate the relationship and check against the proposed answer ---
    # The proposed answer is D, which states: λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1
    # This is equivalent to checking if (λ2 / λ1) >= 1.22.

    # We need to check if (math.sqrt(2) * cross_section_ratio) >= 1.22,
    # given that cross_section_ratio > 1.

    # Let's find the minimum possible value for the ratio λ2 / λ1.
    # This occurs when cross_section_ratio is at its minimum, which is just above 1.
    min_ratio_lambda2_lambda1 = math.sqrt(2) * 1 

    # Now, check if this minimum value satisfies the condition from option D.

    if is_condition_d_satisfied:
        # The logic holds. Since the minimum possible value of λ2/λ1 (~1.414) is greater than 1.22,
        # the relationship λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 is always true under the correct physical assumptions.
        
        # Let's quickly check the other options to be thorough.
        # A) λ2 < λ1 -> λ2/λ1 < 1. False, since min value is ~1.414.
        # B) 1 < λ2/λ1 < 1.22. False, since min value is ~1.414.
        # C) λ2 = λ1 -> λ2/λ1 = 1. False.
