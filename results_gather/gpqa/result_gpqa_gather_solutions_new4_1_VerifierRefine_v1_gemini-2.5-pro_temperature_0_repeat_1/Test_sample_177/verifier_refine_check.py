    Checks the correctness of the answer for the given QFT problem.

    The problem asks for the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory
    with the interaction Lagrangian L_int = κ * ψ_bar * σ_μν * ψ * F^μν.

    The provided answer is D: [κ]_M = -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.
