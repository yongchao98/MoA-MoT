    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the chemistry question.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Define the chemical rules for reagent selectivity and CIP priorities.
    2.  For Reaction A (LiBH4), simulate the reduction of the ester group and determine the effect on CIP priorities.
    3.  Based on the effect (retention/inversion), calculate the required stereochemistry for starting material A to yield the (R) product.
    4.  For Reaction B (BH3), simulate the reduction of the carboxylic acid group and determine the effect on CIP priorities.
    5.  Based on the effect, calculate the required stereochemistry for starting material B to yield the (S) product.
    6.  Compare the calculated requirements with the proposed answer (Option B: A=(S), B=(S)).
