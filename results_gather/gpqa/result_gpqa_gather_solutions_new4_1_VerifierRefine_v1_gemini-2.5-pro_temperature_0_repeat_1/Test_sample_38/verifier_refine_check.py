    Checks the correctness of the answer to the physics problem.

    The problem requires finding the value of 'a' by normalizing the wave function.
    The normalization condition is: ∫[from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|² dx = 1
    Where |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25.

    The integral evaluates to: a² * ln(2) + 0.5.
    Setting this to 1 and solving for 'a' gives: a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2)).
