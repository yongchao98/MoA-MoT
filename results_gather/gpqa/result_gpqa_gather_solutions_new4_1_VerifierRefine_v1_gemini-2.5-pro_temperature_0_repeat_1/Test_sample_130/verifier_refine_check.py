def check_diels_alder_noesy():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer regarding a Diels-Alder reaction and NOESY analysis.

    The function evaluates the reasoning provided in the answer against two key chemical principles:
    1. The stereochemical structure of endo and exo Diels-Alder adducts.
    2. The Alder-endo rule and its potential reversal due to steric hindrance.

    # The LLM's final choice is 'B'.
    # The reasoning provided to reach this choice is as follows:
    # Premise 1: The major product is the 'endo' isomer (based on the standard Alder-endo rule).
    # Premise 2: In the 'endo' isomer, the anhydride protons are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups.
    # Conclusion: Therefore, the unique cross-peak in the major product connects the anhydride protons and vinylic methyls (Option B).

    # The core of the check is to validate the LLM's Premise 2.
    # Does the interaction the LLM attributes to the 'endo' isomer actually occur in the 'endo' isomer?
