    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:

    **Step 1: Identify Product 1**
    *   **Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br₂).
    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.
    *   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.

    **Step 2: Identify Product 2**
    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is a classic named reaction called the **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone, when treated with a strong base, undergoes a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone becomes a five-membered ring.
    *   **Product 2:** The product is a carboxylic acid, specifically **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.

    **Step 3: Identify Product 3**
    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.
    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (acid chloride). The -OH group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a -Cl atom.
    *   **Product 3:** **Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.

    **Step 4: Identify Product 4**
    *   **Reaction:** Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).
    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is a selective reduction. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent that is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes. The reaction stops at the aldehyde stage and does not proceed to the alcohol.
    *   **Product 4:** **Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.

    **Step 5: Analyze Product 4 to count chemically distinct hydrogen atoms**
    *   **Structure:** The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. It has a five-membered ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached.
    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** To count the number of chemically distinct hydrogens (which corresponds to the number of signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum), we must consider the molecule's symmetry.
        *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the rest of the ring.
        *   This symmetry makes the carbons at position 2 and 5 equivalent (C2 ≡ C5).
        *   It also makes the carbons at position 3 and 4 equivalent (C3 ≡ C4).
    *   **Counting the distinct hydrogen environments:**
        1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This proton is in a unique environment. (1 type)
        2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group. It is also unique. (1 type)
        3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent. However, the two protons on each carbon are **diastereotopic** (not equivalent to each other) because of their different spatial relationships to the aldehyde group. The "cis" proton on C2 is equivalent to the "cis" proton on C5, and the "trans" proton on C2 is equivalent to the "trans" proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of protons. (2 types)
        4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent, but the two protons on each are diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct sets of protons. (2 types)

    *   **Total Count:** Summing the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = **6**.

    The number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4 is 6. This corresponds to option C.
