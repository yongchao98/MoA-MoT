    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the organic chemistry question.

    The question asks for the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction:
    3-methylpyrrolidine + A --(B, Heat)--> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine

    The options are:
    A) A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid
    B) A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH
    C) A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid
    D) A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH

    The correct answer is B because:
    1. Reagent A must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the enamine product.
    2. Catalyst B should be a strong acid like TsOH for an efficient dehydration reaction.
