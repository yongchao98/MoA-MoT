    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer based on the biological principles
    outlined in the question.

    The question asks for the *first* observation (t=12h).

    Principles:
    1. Red signal (mRaspberry) is under a lineage-specific promoter, which is inactive
       in undifferentiated iPSCs.
    2. Green signal (TUNEL) detects apoptosis, which is expected in early embryogenesis
       and for rejected donor cells.
