    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We have two astronauts with different rest masses ($m_1 = 2m$, $m_2 = 3m$).\n    *   They are moving at different relativistic speeds in the same direction ($v_1 = 0.6c$, $v_2 = 0.5c$, both in the positive x-direction).\n    *   The goal is to find two quantities:\n        1.  The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between them.\n        2.  The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the system.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$):**\n    *   Since the speeds are relativistic, we cannot simply subtract them ($0.6c - 0.5c$). We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula.\n    *   Let's find the velocity of astronaut 1 ($v_1$) as observed from the reference frame of astronaut 2 ($v_2$). The formula for relative velocity when objects move in the same direction is:\n        $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the given values:\n        $v_1 = 0.6c$\n        $v_2 = 0.5c$\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n    *   Looking at the options, $0.14c$ is the closest value. This narrows down the possible answers to C and D.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   The total energy of a system is the sum of the total energies of its individual components.\n    *   The total energy ($E$) of a single particle with rest mass $m_0$ and velocity $v$ is given by the formula $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n    *   We need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and then add them together.\n\n    *   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n        *   Rest mass: $m_{0,1} = 2m$\n        *   Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n        *   Calculate $\\gamma_1$:\n            $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n        *   Calculate $E_1$:\n            $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_{0,1} c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n    *   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n        *   Rest mass: $m_{0,2} = 3m$\n        *   Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n        *   Calculate $\\gamma_2$:\n            $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.5^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3/4}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n            *Approximation:* $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$, so $\\gamma_2 \\approx 2/1.732 \\approx 1.1547$\n        *   Calculate $E_2$:\n            $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_{0,2} c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n            *Approximation:* $E_2 \\approx 2 \\times 1.732 \\times mc^2 = 3.464 mc^2$\n\n    *   **Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n        *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n        *   $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n        *   *Approximation:* $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\n4.  **Final Check and Selection:**\n    *   Our calculated relative speed is $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n    *   Our calculated total energy is $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n    *   These values match option D exactly.\n\nTo be certain about the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm = 1 # We can use m=1 as a base unit\nc = 1 # We can use c=1 as a base unit\n\n# Astronaut 1\nm1 = 2 * m\nv1 = 0.6 * c\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2 = 3 * m\nv2 = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- Calculate Relative Speed ---\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c**2)\n\n# --- Calculate Total Energy ---\n# Gamma factor for astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v1/c)**2)\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 * c**2\n\n# Gamma factor for astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v2/c)**2)\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 * c**2\n\n# Total energy\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\nprint(f\"v_rel = {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"E_total = {E_total:.2f}mc^2\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find their relative speed, not simple subtraction. The formula for objects moving in the same direction is:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $v_1$ = speed of astronaut 1 = 0.6c\n*   $v_2$ = speed of astronaut 2 = 0.5c\n*   c = speed of light\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428...c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts. The total energy of a moving object is given by the formula:\n\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n\nWhere:\n*   $m_0$ is the rest mass.\n*   $\\gamma$ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 1 (E_1):**\n*   Rest mass, $m_{0,1} = 2m$\n*   Speed, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy, $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_{0,1} c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 2 (E_2):**\n*   Rest mass, $m_{0,2} = 3m$\n*   Speed, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy, $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_{0,2} c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\times (3m) c^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total System Energy (E_total):**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is 5.96 mc². This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
