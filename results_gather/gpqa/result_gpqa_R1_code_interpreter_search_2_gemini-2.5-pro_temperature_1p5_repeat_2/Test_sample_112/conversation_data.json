    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad absorption in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) group. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. While alcohols also show a broad O-H peak, it's typically centered higher (3200-3600 cm⁻¹) and the extreme broadness seen here is a classic sign of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When combined with the broad O-H peak, it further supports the presence of a **carboxylic acid** group (C=O stretch typically at 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n### **2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of a **C=C double bond**, which was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragmentation pattern. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺:\n    *   Carbon (C): 12 amu\n    *   Oxygen (O): 16 amu\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 amu\n    *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   This fragment strongly confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid** group in the molecule.\n\n### **4. Synthesis and Evaluation of Possible Formulas**\n\nBased on the combined spectroscopic evidence, the unknown compound must be an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means:\n1.  It must contain **two oxygen atoms** to form the -COOH group. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n2.  The remaining options are B (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2).\n3.  The molecule must contain at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and another one for the C=C double bond. The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is a measure of the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n\nLet's calculate the DBE for the remaining options using the formula:\n**DBE = C + 1 - (H / 2)**\n\n*   **For B) C6H12O2:**\n    *   DBE = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n    *   A DBE of 1 can only account for one double bond (the C=O of the carboxylic acid). It cannot accommodate an additional C=C double bond. Therefore, this formula is incorrect.\n\n*   **For D) C6H10O2:**\n    *   DBE = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n    *   A DBE of 2 perfectly accounts for the required structural features: one degree of unsaturation for the C=O bond and a second degree of unsaturation for the C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C6H10O2. It represents a hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
