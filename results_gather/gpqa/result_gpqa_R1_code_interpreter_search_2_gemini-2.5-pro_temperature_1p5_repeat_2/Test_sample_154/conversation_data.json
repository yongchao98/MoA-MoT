    "Here's my thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main goal is to calculate the uncertainty in the operator $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of Uncertainty:** In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the standard deviation formula:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    where $\\langle A \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$, and $\\langle A^2 \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to $P_z$:** For the operator $P_z$, the formula becomes:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n4.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The matrix for the operator $P_z$ is:\n        $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The problem also provides matrices for $P_x$ and $P_y$ and states that $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This is extra information that I can use to verify the context but isn't strictly necessary for the calculation of $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n5.  **Plan the Calculation:** I need to compute two quantities:\n    a.  The expectation value of $P_z$, $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\n    b.  The expectation value of $P_z^2$, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\n\n6.  **Step-by-step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **First, I need the bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$**, which is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all components are real, it's just the transpose:\n        $\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    *   **Calculate $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$\n        I will first compute the action of the operator on the ket: $P_z |\\psi\\rangle$.\n        $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        Now, I'll take the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( 1/4 + 0 - 1/4 \\right) = 0$\n\n    *   **Calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n        First, I need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$.\n        $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $P_z^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-\\hbar)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        Now I compute the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\n        First, $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        Then, the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( 1/4 + 0 + 1/4 \\right) = \\hbar^2 (2/4) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n    *   **Alternative way to calculate expectation values:**\n        Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\\lambda_1 = \\hbar, \\lambda_2 = 0, \\lambda_3 = -\\hbar$, we can express $|\\psi\\rangle$ in this basis:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = c_1 |v_1\\rangle + c_2 |v_2\\rangle + c_3 |v_3\\rangle$\n        where $c_1 = -1/2, c_2 = 1/\\sqrt{2}, c_3 = -1/2$.\n        The probability of measuring each eigenvalue is $p_i = |c_i|^2$.\n        $p_1 = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n        $p_2 = |1/\\sqrt{2}|^2 = 1/2$\n        $p_3 = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\sum_i p_i \\lambda_i = (1/4)(\\hbar) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-\\hbar) = 0$.\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\sum_i p_i \\lambda_i^2 = (1/4)(\\hbar^2) + (1/2)(0^2) + (1/4)(-\\hbar)^2 = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n        This confirms my previous results.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Uncertainty:**\n    Now I substitute the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n8.  **Final Check and Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated uncertainty is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This matches option A.\n    I can also write a small python script to verify the numerical calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set hbar to 1 for simplicity, we will add it back in the end.\nhbar = 1.0\n\n# Define the state vector psi\npsi = np.array([[-0.5], [1/np.sqrt(2)], [-0.5]])\n\n# Define the operator Pz in units of hbar\nPz_matrix_no_hbar = np.array([[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, -1.0]])\nPz = hbar * Pz_matrix_no_hbar\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz\n# <Pz> = <psi|Pz|psi>\n# psi.T is the conjugate transpose for real vectors\nexp_Pz = (psi.T @ Pz @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the operator Pz^2\nPz_squared = Pz @ Pz\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz^2\n# <Pz^2> = <psi|Pz^2|psi>\nexp_Pz_squared = (psi.T @ Pz_squared @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty squared\nuncertainty_squared = exp_Pz_squared - exp_Pz**2\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty\nuncertainty = np.sqrt(uncertainty_squared)\n\n# The final value is this number multiplied by hbar.\n# We expect the numerical value to be 1/sqrt(2)\n# 1/sqrt(2) is approximately 0.7071\nprint(uncertainty)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.7071067811865476\n</execute_code>\nThe python code output is approximately 0.7071, which is the numerical value for $1/\\sqrt{2}$. My calculation is correct. The uncertainty is $\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n<<<A>>>",
