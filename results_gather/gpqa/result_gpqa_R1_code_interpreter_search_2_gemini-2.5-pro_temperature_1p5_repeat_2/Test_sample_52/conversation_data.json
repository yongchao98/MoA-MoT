    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms are replaced by substituents. The aromatic core is therefore C6H4.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group is present. The functional group is -COO-. This adds one carbon and two oxygen atoms to our count.\n    *   **1H NMR Data:**\n        *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information, as it severely restricts the possible structures of the substituents.\n        *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons (C6**H4**). Having only two signals for these four protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4- (para) substitution, which would make the protons chemically equivalent in two sets of two.\n        *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n            *   Let's label the protons: `Ha-C=C-Hb-CH3`.\n            *   Proton `Hb` is coupled to `Ha` (a vinyl proton, n=1) and the `CH3` group (n=3). According to the n+1 rule, its signal would be split into a doublet (by Ha) and then each of those peaks into a quartet (by CH3), resulting in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n            *   Proton `Ha` is coupled only to `Hb` (n=1), so its signal would be a **doublet (d)**.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment. This fragment accounts for two vinyl-H signals and one of the -CH3 signals.\n        *   **Two –CH3 group signals:** We have identified one methyl group as part of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`) substituent. There must be a second, chemically different methyl group somewhere else in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular structure from the fragments:**\n    *   We have the aromatic core: `C6H4`.\n    *   We have one substituent, the propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   The second substituent must contain the ester group (`-COO-`) and the second methyl group (`-CH3`). Importantly, this substituent cannot contain any `-CH2-` groups.\n    *   Let's consider the possibilities for this second substituent:\n        *   **Case A: Methyl ester group (`-COOCH3`)**: This group contains the ester linkage and a methyl group. It has no `-CH2-` groups. This is a valid possibility.\n        *   **Case B: Acetoxy group (`-OCOCH3`)**: This group also contains the ester linkage and a methyl group, with no `-CH2-` groups. This is also a valid possibility.\n\n3.  **Calculate the chemical formula based on the assembled structure:**\n    Whether the second substituent is `-COOCH3` or `-OCOCH3`, its chemical formula is the same (C2H3O2). Let's calculate the total formula for the entire molecule.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** `C6H4`\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** `-CH=CH-CH3` -> `C3H5`\n    *   **Ester/Methyl Group:** `-COOCH3` or `-OCOCH3` -> `C2H3O2`\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester/acetoxy) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** **2** (from ester)\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU is a measure of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **From the derived structure:** Benzene ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DoU) + vinyl C=C double bond (1 DoU) + ester C=O double bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n    *   **From the potential formulas:** The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - H/2`.\n        *   A) `C11H12O2`: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. (Matches)\n        *   B) `C11H14O2`: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Does not match)\n        *   C) `C12H12O2`: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (Does not match)\n        *   D) `C12H14O2`: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**. (Matches)\n\n5.  **Compare the two possibilities (A and D):**\n    We have shown that the structure deduced from the spectral data has the formula `C11H12O2`. Let's consider if a molecule with the formula `C12H14O2` could also fit the data. To get from `C11H12O2` to `C12H14O2`, we need to add a `CH2` unit. However, the NMR spectrum explicitly shows **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**. This rules out the possibility of `C12H14O2`. Therefore, the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is `C11H12O2`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
