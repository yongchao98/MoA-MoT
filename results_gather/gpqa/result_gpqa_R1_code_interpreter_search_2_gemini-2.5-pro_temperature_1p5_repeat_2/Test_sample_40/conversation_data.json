    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let `S` be the stationary laboratory frame, where the observer is.\n    *   Let `S'` be the reference frame that is moving along with the glass.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame `S'`) relative to the laboratory (frame `S`) is `v`. The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam.\n    *   The speed of light inside the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass (`S'`), is `u'`. The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`), so `n = c / u'`. This gives `u' = c / n`.\n    *   We need to find the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (`S`). Let's call this speed `u`.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Law:**\n    *   In classical (Galilean) relativity, we would simply add the velocities: `u = u' + v = c/n + v`.\n    *   However, since the speeds involved can be close to the speed of light, we must use Einstein's special theory of relativity. The correct formula is the relativistic velocity-addition formula.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity-Addition Formula:**\n    *   The formula for adding velocities `u'` and `v` that are in the same direction is:\n        `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    *   We know `u' = c/n`. Let's substitute this into the formula:\n        `u = (c/n + v) / (1 + ((c/n) * v) / c^2)`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   Simplify the term in the denominator:\n        `u = (c/n + v) / (1 + (v / (n*c)))`\n\n7.  **Apply the Given Condition c=1:**\n    *   The problem specifies to use `c = 1`. Substituting this into our simplified expression:\n        `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n8.  **Perform Algebraic Manipulation:**\n    *   To get rid of the fractions in the numerator and the denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n        `u = n * (1/n + v) / (n * (1 + v/n))`\n    *   Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n        `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n        `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The derived expression for the speed of light relative to the observer is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n        B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n        C) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n        D) 1\n    *   Our result matches option C.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as the Fizeau effect or relativistic Fresnel drag, which was one of the early confirmations of special relativity. The relativistic velocity addition formula correctly predicts the observed speed of light in a moving medium.\n\n<<<C>>>"
