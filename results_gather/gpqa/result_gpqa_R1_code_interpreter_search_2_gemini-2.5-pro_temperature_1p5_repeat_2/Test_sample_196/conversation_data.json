    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the IR Spectrum of Compound X**\n\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid that exists as a hydrogen-bonded dimer.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, and its position is consistent with that of a carboxylic acid (often around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The data strongly suggests that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Compound X**\n\nLet's break down the NMR signals to build the structure piece by piece.\n\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal, which is a broad singlet (bs) and highly downfield, is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid group (-COO**H**). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). They are both doublets (d) and each integrates to 2 protons. This pattern is indicative of a **para-disubstituted** (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. One substituent is the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, which deshields the adjacent (ortho) protons, causing them to appear further downfield (at 8.0 ppm). The other substituent is an alkyl group, whose ortho protons appear at 7.2 ppm.\n*   **Analysis of the Alkyl Group Signals:** The remaining signals must describe the structure of the second substituent on the ring.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This points to an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2 protons is consistent with the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It's a multiplet because it's coupled to both the adjacent -CH₃ (at 0.9 ppm) and the methine (-CH-) group.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). This proton is attached directly to the benzene ring (a benzylic position), which explains its relatively downfield shift. It is coupled to the protons of the adjacent -CH₃ (at 1.4 ppm) and -CH₂- (at 1.7 ppm) groups, making it a multiplet.\n\n*   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Putting these fragments together (-CH₂CH₃ and -CHCH₃), with the -CH group attached to the ring, gives the following structure:\n    `Aromatic Ring - CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃`\n    This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of Compound X**\n\nCombining all the pieces, Compound X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para (position 4) position.\nThe structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B), but option (B) is the starting material, not the final product.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Reaction and Identify the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Transformation:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, will undergo the reduction of its carboxylic acid group. The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Product: The -COOH at position 1 is reduced to -CH₃. The product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material (Compound X).\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: **Correct**. This matches the predicted product of the reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
