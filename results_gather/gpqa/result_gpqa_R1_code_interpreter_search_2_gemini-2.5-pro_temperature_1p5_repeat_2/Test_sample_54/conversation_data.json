    "*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n    1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** The signal corresponds to three equivalent protons, which is consistent with a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning these protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This signal represents an acetyl group (CH₃-C=O). All four options contain an acetate group, so this signal is consistent with all of them.\n\n    2.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (4.5-7.5 ppm):** This region is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons attached to a double bond, C=C-H).\n        *   **Integration (1H each):** We have two distinct vinylic protons. This rules out a symmetrical structure and indicates a substituted double bond of the type R-CH=CH-R'.\n        *   **Structure so far:** We have an acetyl group and a -CH=CH- fragment. The molecule must be an enol acetate, with the structure R-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃. The proton at 7.0 ppm is significantly downfield, which is expected for a proton attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom (-O-CH=).\n\n    3.  **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant J = 16.0 Hz. This means it is coupled to only one other proton (the one at 5.5 ppm).\n        *   The magnitude of the coupling constant between two vinylic protons is highly diagnostic of the stereochemistry of the double bond.\n            *   A large coupling constant (typically **12-18 Hz**) indicates a **trans** configuration.\n            *   A smaller coupling constant (typically **6-12 Hz**) indicates a **cis** configuration.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates that the two protons on the double bond are **trans** to each other. This eliminates the *cis* isomers (A and D). We are left with Trans-propenyl acetate (C) and Trans-butenyl acetate (B).\n\n    4.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, typical for a methyl group attached to a double bond (C=C-CH₃).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This represents a methyl group.\n        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, meaning this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This confirms the presence of a CH₃-CH= fragment. The proton splitting this methyl group is the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n    5.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n        *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This confirms the connectivity. The 'd' (doublet) splitting comes from coupling to the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm). The 'q' (quartet) splitting comes from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a **trans** double bond (-CH=CH-).\n    *   One side is attached to an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-CH₃).\n    *   The other side is attached to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃(at 1.6) - CH(at 5.5) = CH(at 7.0) - O - C(=O) - CH₃(at 2.1)`.\n    *   The alkene part of the molecule has three carbons (`CH₃-CH=CH-`), which corresponds to a **propenyl** group.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n*   **Comparing with Options:**\n    *   A) Cis-propenyl acetate: Incorrect stereochemistry (J would be smaller).\n    *   B) Trans-butenyl acetate: Incorrect carbon count in the alkyl chain. A butenyl group would have four carbons (e.g., CH₃CH₂-CH=CH-), which would show signals for an ethyl group, not just a methyl group.\n    *   C) Trans-propenyl acetate: Matches the stereochemistry and the carbon skeleton perfectly.\n    *   D) Cis-butenyl acetate: Incorrect stereochemistry and carbon count.\n\n<<<C>>>"
