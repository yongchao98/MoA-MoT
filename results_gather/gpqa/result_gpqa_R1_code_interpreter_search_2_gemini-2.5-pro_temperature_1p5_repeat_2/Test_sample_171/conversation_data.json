    "This problem requires applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atomic energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy level 'b' ($N_b$) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level 'a' ($N_a$) is given by:\n\n$N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T))$\n\nWhere:\n*   $g_b$ and $g_a$ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   $E_b - E_a$ is the energy difference between the levels, which we'll call $\\Delta E$.\n*   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's denote the ratio of populations ($N_b / N_a$) as the \"excitation ratio,\" $R$.\n\n$R = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T))$\n\n**2. Applying the Equation to the Two Stars**\n\nWe have two stars, star_1 and star_2, with temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively. We can write the excitation ratio for each star:\n\n*   For star_1:  $R_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1))$\n*   For star_2:  $R_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$\n\nThe energy levels and statistical weights are properties of the iron atom, so the terms $\\Delta E$ and $(g_b / g_a)$ are the same for both stars.\n\n**3. Using the Information from the Problem**\n\nThe problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice the excitation in star_2. This means:\n\n$R_1 = 2 * R_2$\n\nNow we substitute the Boltzmann equations into this relationship:\n\n$(g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))]$\n\nThe term $(g_b / g_a)$ cancels out from both sides:\n\n$exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$\n\n**4. Solving for the Relationship Between T1 and T2**\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n\n$ln(exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1))) = ln(2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2)))$\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms ($ln(ab) = ln(a) + ln(b)$ and $ln(e^x) = x$):\n\n$-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2)))$\n$-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - \\Delta E / (k * T_2)$\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate $ln(2)$:\n\n$ln(2) = \\Delta E / (k * T_2) - \\Delta E / (k * T_1)$\n\nFactor out the common term $\\Delta E / k$:\n\n$ln(2) = (\\Delta E / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)$\n\nCombine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n\n$ln(2) = (\\Delta E / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]$\n\n**5. Using the Given Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J$.\nThe Boltzmann constant is $k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J/K$.\n\nWe can calculate the value of the pre-factor $(\\Delta E / k)$:\n\n$(\\Delta E / k) \\approx (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J) / (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J/K) = 1 K$\n\nThe problem is designed so that this factor is exactly 1. Substituting this into our equation:\n\n$ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]$\n\n$ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]$\n\nThis equation matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
