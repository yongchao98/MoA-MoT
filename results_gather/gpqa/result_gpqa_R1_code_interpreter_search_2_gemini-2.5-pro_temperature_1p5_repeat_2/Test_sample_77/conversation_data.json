    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that the electromagnetic field at a point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, called the retarded time ($t_r$), such that a signal traveling at the speed of light from the charge's position at $t_r$ reaches the observer at $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n**1. Definitions and Setup**\n*   $q$: The point charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t)$: The trajectory of the charge, its position as a function of time.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: The field point (observation point).\n*   $t_r$: The retarded time, the time at which the signal was emitted from the charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the source's retarded position to the field point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$: The distance from the source's retarded position to the field point.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $c$: The speed of light in a vacuum.\n*   $\\epsilon_o$: The permittivity of free space.\n*   $\\mu_o$: The permeability of free space.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined implicitly by the relation:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\nThis equation states that the time delay $(t - t_r)$ is the time it takes for light to travel the distance $d$ from the source to the observer.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\nThe potentials are found by solving Maxwell's equations, which in the Lorenz gauge lead to the retarded potential integrals:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge $q$ with trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge density and current density are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for $V(\\vec{r}, t)$:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\iint \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} \\delta(t' - t + |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|/c) d^3r' dt'$\n\nIntegrating over the spatial coordinates $\\vec{r}'$ first collapses the Dirac delta function $\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t')|} \\delta(t' - t + \\frac{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t')|}{c}) dt'$\n\nThis integral is of the form $\\int f(t') \\delta(g(t')) dt'$. Its value is $\\frac{f(t_r)}{|g'(t_r)|}$, where $t_r$ is the time at which $g(t_r)=0$.\nHere, $f(t') = \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t')|}$ and $g(t') = t' - t + \\frac{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t')|}{c}$.\nThe root of $g(t')=0$ is indeed the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nWe need to calculate the derivative $g'(t_r)$:\n$g'(t') = \\frac{d}{dt'}(t' - t + \\frac{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t')|}{c}) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t')|$\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{X}| = \\frac{\\vec{X} \\cdot \\dot{\\vec{X}}}{|\\vec{X}|}$, where $\\vec{X} = \\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t')$ and $\\dot{\\vec{X}} = -\\vec{v}(t')$.\n$g'(t') = 1 + \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot (-\\vec{v}(t'))}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t')|} = 1 - \\frac{(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')}{c|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t')|}$\n\nEvaluating at $t' = t_r$ and using our definitions for $\\vec{d}$ and $\\vec{v}$:\n$g'(t_r) = 1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{cd}$\n\nSo, the scalar potential is:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{f(t_r)}{|g'(t_r)|} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1/d}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{cd}} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{c}{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThe derivation for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is identical, except the charge $q$ is replaced by the current term $q\\vec{v}(t_r)$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{cd})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**3. Comparison with Options**\nThe derived expressions are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: Incorrect. This neglects the retardation effect in the denominator.\nB) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: This exactly matches our derived expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\nC) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: Incorrect. Same issue as A, and the expression for A is dimensionally wrong.\nD) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The minus sign is a crucial consequence of the retardation calculation.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert scalar and vector potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>"
