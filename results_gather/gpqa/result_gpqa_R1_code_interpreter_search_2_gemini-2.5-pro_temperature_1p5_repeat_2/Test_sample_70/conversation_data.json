    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties (like albedo). The formula is:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet 4 ($T_{eq4}$) and Planet 2 ($T_{eq2}$), we can set up the following equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_4}} \\cdot (1 - A_4)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant and cancel out. The problem also states that the planets have the same albedo ($A_4 = A_2$), so the $(1-A)$ term also cancels out. The equation simplifies to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_4}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n\nThis shows that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law**\n\nWe don't have the orbital distances ($a_2$, $a_4$), but we do have the ratio of their orbital periods ($T_2$, $T_4$). Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n\n$T^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nWe can write this as a ratio:\n\n$(\\frac{T_4}{T_2})^2 = (\\frac{a_4}{a_2})^3$\n\nWe need to find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_4}$ for our temperature equation. Let's rearrange Kepler's Law:\n\n$\\frac{a_4}{a_2} = (\\frac{T_4}{T_2})^{2/3}$\n\nAnd taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = (\\frac{T_2}{T_4})^{2/3}$\n\n**3. Combine the Equations and Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $\\frac{a_2}{a_4}$ back into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{T_2}{T_4})^{2/3}} = (\\frac{T_2}{T_4})^{(2/3) \\cdot (1/2)} = (\\frac{T_2}{T_4})^{1/3}$\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5. Therefore:\n*   The period value for Planet_2 ($T_2$) is 2.\n*   The period value for Planet_4 ($T_4$) is 3.5.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into our final equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3}$\n\nLet's compute the numerical value for this expression.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures\n# T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T2 / T4)^(1/3)\nT2_ratio = 2\nT4_ratio = 3.5\n\n# Calculate the ratio\nresult = (T2_ratio / T4_ratio)**(1/3)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.8296727271404179\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.83.

    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is given by:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. For a circular orbit, this is the orbital distance.\n*   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo (the fraction of incident radiation reflected back to space).\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 ($T_{eq4}$) and Planet_2 ($T_{eq2}$):\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_4}} \\cdot (1 - A_4)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constants and cancel out. It is also given that the planets possess the same albedo, so $A_4 = A_2$, which means the $(1-A)^{1/4}$ term also cancels. The equation simplifies to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_4}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n\nThis shows that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances.\n\n**2.

Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$):\n\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nWe can write this as a ratio for our two planets:\n\n$(\\frac{P_4}{P_2})^2 = (\\frac{a_4}{a_2})^3$\n\nWe need to find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_4}$ for our temperature equation.

Combine the Equations and Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\frac{a_2}{a_4}$ back into our simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{2/3}}$\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{(2/3) \\cdot (1/2)} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5, respectively. Therefore, we can use these relative values for the periods:\n*   The relative period for Planet_2 ($P_2$) is 2.\n*   The relative period for Planet_4 ($P_4$) is 3.5.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into our final equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3}$\n\nLet's compute the numerical value for this expression.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures\n# The ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2 is equal to (P2 / P4)^(1/3), where P2 and P4 are the orbital periods.\n# From the problem, the ratio of orbital periods is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 to Planet_5.\n# Thus, the relative period for Planet_2 is 2.\n# And the relative period for Planet_4 is 3.5.\n\nperiod_ratio_p2 = 2\nperiod_ratio_p4 = 3.5\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio\ntemperature_ratio = (period_ratio_p2 / period_ratio_p4)**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.8298265333662435\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.83.

The ratio of equilibrium temperatures ($T_{eq}$) between two planets (4 and 2) orbiting the same star with the same albedo simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n    where $a$ is the orbital distance.\n\n2.  From Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3$), the ratio of orbital distances can be related to the ratio of orbital periods ($P$):\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{2/3}$\n\n3.
