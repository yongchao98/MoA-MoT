    "This problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a nearby grounded conducting sphere. We can solve this using the method of images.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nThe electric field and potential outside the conducting sphere can be calculated by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the original sphere is zero (since it's grounded).\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` (also from the center, along the same line as `q`) are given by:\n\n*   **Image charge value:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `d' = R^2 / d`\n\nThe potential and force on the charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere are now simply the potential and force due to the image charge `q'`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of the system.\n\n#### Method 1: Work Done to Assemble the System\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the electrostatic force between `q` and its corresponding image charge.\n\nAt an arbitrary position `x` (where `x > R`), the force on `q` is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance)^2`\n\nThe image charge at this point is `q'(x) = -q * (R/x)`, and its position is `x' = R^2/x`.\nThe distance between the charge `q` and its image `q'` is `x - x' = x - R^2/x`.\n\nSo the force on charge `q` is:\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 * ( (x^2 - R^2)/x )^2)`\n`F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nThe potential energy `U` at a final distance `d` is the work done against this force to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d`.\n`U(d) = - ∫[from ∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n`U(d) = - ∫[from ∞ to d] (-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n`U(d) = k * q^2 * R ∫[from ∞ to d] (x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`.\n`∫ (x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx = ∫ (1/2) * (1/u^2) du = -1/(2u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n`U(d) = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n`U(d) = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))) ]`\n`U(d) = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0 ]`\n`U(d) = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula `U = (1/2)qV`\n\nThe potential energy of a system of charges and conductors can be calculated as `U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`. For our system, this simplifies to:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nHere, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all *other* charges, which are the induced charges on the sphere's surface. Since the sphere is grounded, there is no contribution from the potential of the sphere itself.\n\nThe potential created by the induced charges at the location of `q` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n\nThe potential at `d` due to `q'` at `d'` is:\n`V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n`distance = d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, we substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The net potential energy of the system is:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
