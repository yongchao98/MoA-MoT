    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Product 1\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). Adamantane has a rigid, strain-free cage structure.\n2.  **Reaction:** Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. This is a strong base at high temperature. Direct E2 elimination is impossible at a bridgehead carbon due to Bredt's rule (cannot form a planar double bond at the bridgehead).\n3.  **Product 1 Analysis:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** A characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The total integration is 14H. Assuming the product contains one oxygen atom from the reaction with KOH (a common scenario where water is present or from the hydroxide itself), the formula would be C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   **Degrees of Unsaturation:** For C₁₀H₁₄O, the degrees of unsaturation = (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 8/2 = 4.\n    *   **Structure Determination:** The most striking feature of the NMR spectrum is the signal at **4.79 ppm (2H)**. This chemical shift is typical for vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂). A standard adamantane skeleton with a ketone (adamantanone) would not have any protons in this region. This suggests the adamantane cage has rearranged.\n    *   A known reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under basic conditions is a fragmentation-rearrangement to a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system. Let's propose a structure that fits the data: **7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n        *   This structure has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n        *   It has a ketone group (C=O at position 3), consistent with the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n        *   It has an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂ at position 7), whose two protons would appear around 4.8 ppm, matching the signal at 4.79 ppm (2H).\n        *   It has 12 other aliphatic protons on the bicyclic frame, matching the signals at 2.41-2.23 (10H) and 1.94 (2H).\n        *   The degrees of unsaturation are 4 (2 rings + 1 C=C + 1 C=O), which matches the molecular formula.\n    *   Therefore, **Product 1 is 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Product 2\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Reagent's Function:** This is the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. It does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n3.  **Product 2 Structure:** The ketone group in Product 1 is reduced to a secondary alcohol.\n    *   **Product 2 is 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Product 3\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Reagent's Function:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup (using DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. The reductive workup converts the intermediates into aldehydes or ketones.\n3.  **Product 3 Structure:** The exocyclic double bond (=CH₂) in Product 2 is cleaved.\n    *   The =CH₂ carbon atom becomes formaldehyde (which is washed away).\n    *   The C7 carbon of the ring becomes a ketone (C=O).\n    *   The alcohol group at C3 remains unchanged.\n    *   **Product 3 is 3-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR of Product 3\n\n1.  **Goal:** Determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton).\n2.  **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:**\n    *   Protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8) would be around δ 2.2-2.6.\n    *   The proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (at C3, let's call it **H3**) is significantly deshielded by the electronegative oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of δ 3.5-4.5.\n    *   Other protons (bridgehead, alpha to alcohol) are less deshielded than H3.\n    *   Thus, **H3 is the most deshielded proton** we need to consider.\n3.  **Determining the Coupling Pattern of H3:**\n    *   To find the coupling pattern (splitting), we need to look at the neighboring protons. The neighbors of H3 are the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   The molecule 3-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C3, the oxygen atom, C9, and C7.\n    *   This symmetry makes C2 and C4 equivalent. It also means that the protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C4.\n    *   H3 is coupled to four protons in total: two on C2 and two on C4.\n    *   Let's analyze the coupling relationships. The four neighboring protons are not all equivalent to each other. In the rigid chair-like conformation of the ring, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (e.g., one axial-like, one equatorial-like). The same is true for C4.\n    *   Due to the symmetry, H3 couples to one set of two equivalent protons (e.g., H2-axial and H4-axial) with a coupling constant Jₐ.\n    *   H3 also couples to another set of two equivalent protons (e.g., H2-equatorial and H4-equatorial) with a different coupling constant Jₑ.\n    *   The splitting pattern for coupling to two equivalent protons with constant J is a triplet.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for H3 will be split into a triplet by the first pair of protons (coupling Jₐ), and each line of that triplet will be further split into another triplet by the second pair of protons (coupling Jₑ).\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**. This assumes Jₐ is sufficiently different from Jₑ, which is expected in a rigid bicyclic system.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the coupling pattern for the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton (H3) is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<A>>>"
