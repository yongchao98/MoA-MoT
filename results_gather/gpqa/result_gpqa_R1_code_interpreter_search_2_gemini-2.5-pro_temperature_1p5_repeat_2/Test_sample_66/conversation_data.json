    "The user wants to find the probability of a specific measurement outcome for a 2-electron system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the System and the State\n\n*   **System:** Two electrons, each in a p-orbital. The orbital angular momentum quantum number for a p-orbital is $l=1$. So, for the two electrons, we have $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n*   **Individual Quantum States:** For each electron, the possible values for the z-component of the orbital angular momentum quantum number ($m_l$) are $m_1 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ and $m_2 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. The corresponding eigenvalues of the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are $m_1\\hbar$ and $m_2\\hbar$.\n*   **Coupled State:** The two-electron system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state given by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: orbital angular momentum of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: orbital angular momentum of electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$: total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m = -1$: the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\n### 2. Understanding the Measurement\n\n*   **Measurement:** A joint measurement of the z-components of the orbital angular momentum of each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n*   **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the probability of obtaining the following eigenvalues:\n    *   For $L_{1z}$, the eigenvalue is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For $L_{2z}$, the eigenvalue is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n### 3. Applying the Conservation Principle\n\nThe total angular momentum operator in the z-direction, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual operators:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThe coupled state $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar$.\n$L_z |l,m\\rangle = m\\hbar |l,m\\rangle$\n$L_z |2,-1\\rangle = -1\\hbar |2,-1\\rangle$\n\nWhen we measure the individual components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, their corresponding quantum numbers $m_1$ and $m_2$ must sum up to the total quantum number $m$.\n$m_1 + m_2 = m$\n\nIn our case, the system is in the state with $m=-1$. So, any measurement of $m_1$ and $m_2$ must satisfy:\n$m_1 + m_2 = -1$\n\nThe question asks for the probability of the outcome where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Let's check if this outcome satisfies the conservation rule:\n$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\nSince $-2 \\neq -1$, this outcome is physically impossible. An event that is impossible has a probability of 0.\n\n### 4. Formal Calculation using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients\n\nWe can confirm this by expressing the coupled state in terms of the uncoupled states $|l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle$. This expansion is done using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n$|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C(l_1, l_2, l; m_1, m_2, m) |l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle$\n\nThe probability of finding the system in the state $|l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle|1, -1\\rangle$ is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the system state onto this state:\n$P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $C(1, 1, 2; -1, -1, -1)$.\nA fundamental property of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\nHere, $m_1=-1$, $m_2=-1$, and $m=-1$. Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2 \\neq m$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n$C(1, 1, 2; -1, -1, -1) = 0$\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\n### Conclusion\nThe measurement outcome of finding both electrons with a z-component of angular momentum of $-\\hbar$ is not possible because it would violate the conservation of the z-component of the total angular momentum of the system. The initial state has a total $m = -1$, while the desired final state has $m_1+m_2 = -2$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
