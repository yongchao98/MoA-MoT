    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the order of magnitude of the entropy (S) of a supermassive black hole given its angular size (θ) and distance (d).\n\n### 2. Identify Key Physical Principles and Formulas\nTo solve this problem, we need to connect the observable quantities (d, θ) to the intrinsic properties of the black hole (Mass, Area) and finally to its entropy. The key formulas are:\n\n*   **Small Angle Approximation:** This relates the physical size (D) of an object to its angular size (θ) and distance (d). For small angles measured in radians, the formula is:\n    $D \\approx d \\times \\theta$\n    In our case, the physical size D is the diameter of the event horizon, which is twice the Schwarzschild radius ($D = 2R_s$).\n\n*   **Schwarzschild Radius ($R_s$):** The radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating, uncharged black hole is given by:\n    $R_s = \\frac{2GM}{c^2}$\n    where M is the mass of the black hole, G is the gravitational constant, and c is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Area of the Event Horizon (A):** The event horizon is a sphere, so its surface area is:\n    $A = 4\\pi R_s^2$\n\n*   **Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy (S):** The entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon:\n    $S = \\frac{k_B A}{4 L_P^2} = \\frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 \\hbar G}$\n    where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $L_P = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar G}{c^3}}$ is the Planck length.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation Plan\n\n1.  **Convert Units:** The given values are not in standard SI units.\n    *   Convert the distance `d` from parsecs to meters.\n    *   Convert the angular size `θ` from degrees to radians.\n2.  **Calculate the Schwarzschild Radius ($R_s$):** Use the small angle approximation to find the diameter of the event horizon ($2R_s$) and then the radius.\n3.  **Calculate the Area of the Event Horizon (A):** Use the calculated $R_s$ in the formula for the area of a sphere.\n4.  **Calculate the Entropy (S):** Use the calculated area A in the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.\n5.  **Determine the Order of Magnitude:** Check the power of 10 in the final result and compare it with the given options.\n\n### 4.
