    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of detectable stars.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Observability of Each Star from Paranal\n\nParanal Observatory is located in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. This means stars with a very high positive declination are not visible.\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** The declination of Canopus is approximately -52° 41'. As a southern star, it is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **b) Polaris:** The declination of Polaris (the North Star) is approximately +89° 16'. From a latitude of -24.6°, Polaris is always far below the horizon and is **not observable**.\n*   **c), d), e), f):** These hypothetical stars are all located at a declination (DEC) of 0°. The celestial equator is observable from all latitudes except the poles. From Paranal, stars at DEC=0° pass high in the sky and are easily observable.\n\nTherefore, Polaris (b) can be immediately ruled out. We only need to assess the detectability of stars a, c, d, e, and f.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Limiting Magnitude for ESPRESSO\n\nThe problem requires determining the faintest star that can be observed with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 in a 1-hour exposure. We can use the performance data provided in the official ESPRESSO User Manual (a reliable source of information) or the overview page.\n\nThe manual provides S/N estimates for a 30-minute (1800 s) exposure under typical conditions (seeing 1\", airmass 1.2).\n*   For a star with V = 14 mag, S/N ≈ 12.8.\n*   For a star with V = 16 mag, S/N ≈ 5.1.\n\nThe question specifies a 1-hour (3600 s) exposure. For observations dominated by photon noise from the star (a good approximation in this magnitude range), the S/N ratio scales with the square root of the exposure time.\n\nS/N (1 hour) = S/N (30 min) * sqrt(3600 s / 1800 s) = S/N (30 min) * sqrt(2) ≈ S/N (30 min) * 1.414\n\nLet's calculate the S/N for a 1-hour exposure:\n*   For V = 14: S/N = 12.8 * 1.414 ≈ 18.1\n*   For V = 16: S/N = 5.1 * 1.414 ≈ 7.2\n\nWe need to find the magnitude (V) that results in an S/N of 10. The target S/N of 10 is between the S/N values for V=14 and V=16. We can interpolate to find the limiting magnitude. The relationship between magnitude (V) and S/N (in the photon-noise regime) is S/N ∝ 10^(-0.2*V).\n\nUsing the V=14 data point as a reference:\nV_limit = V_ref - 5 * log10(S/N_target / S/N_ref)\nV_limit = 14 - 5 * log10(10 / 18.1)\nV_limit = 14 - 5 * log10(0.552)\nV_limit = 14 - 5 * (-0.258)\nV_limit = 14 + 1.29\nV_limit ≈ 15.3 mag\n\nSo, a star is detectable if its apparent V magnitude is approximately 15.3 or brighter (i.e., m_V ≤ 15.3).\n\n### Step 3: Assess Each Star's Detectability\n\nNow we compare the apparent magnitude of each observable star to our limiting magnitude of 15.3.\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** Apparent V magnitude ≈ -0.74. This is much brighter than 15.3. It is **detectable**.\n*   **b) Polaris:** Already ruled out as not observable.\n*   **c) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 10 pc:** We calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula:\n    m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5*(1) - 5 = 15.0.\n    Since 15.0 ≤ 15.3, this star is **detectable**.\n*   **d) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 200 pc:**\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5*(2.30) - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5.\n    Since 21.5 > 15.3, this star is too faint and is **not detectable**.\n*   **e) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 5 pc:**\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5*(0.70) - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5.\n    Since 13.5 ≤ 15.3, this star is **detectable**.\n*   **f) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 50 pc:**\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5*(1.70) - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5.\n    Since 18.5 > 15.3, this star is too faint and is **not detectable**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nLet's summarize the results:\n*   a) Canopus: **Detectable**\n*   b) Polaris: Not detectable (not observable)\n*   c) Star (10 pc): **Detectable**\n*   d) Star (200 pc): Not detectable (too faint)\n*   e) Star (5 pc): **Detectable**\n*   f) Star (50 pc): Not detectable (too faint)\n\nCounting the detectable stars, we have a total of 3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
