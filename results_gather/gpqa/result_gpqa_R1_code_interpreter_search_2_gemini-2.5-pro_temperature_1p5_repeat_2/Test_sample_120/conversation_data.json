    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reagents\n\n*   **Starting Material**: The name is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The core structure `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6 of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   Substituents are three methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry of the four chiral centers (C1, C3, C4, C6) is given by the IUPAC name: C1 is R, C3 is R, C4 is R, and C6 is S.\n*   **Reagent**: The reagent is Me₂CuLi, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. This reagent acts as a source of the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n### 2. Understand the Reaction Mechanism\n\nThe question states the key rules for the reaction of saturated epoxides with organocuprates:\n1.  **Regioselectivity**: \"The alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n2.  **Stereospecificity**: \"Inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n\nThis describes a standard Sₙ2-type reaction.\n\n### 3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regiochemistry)\n\n*   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   We need to compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n    *   Carbon C1 has a methyl group attached to it, in addition to being part of the bicyclic system.\n    *   Carbon C6 does not have a methyl group; it has a hydrogen atom.\n*   Comparing a carbon atom with a methyl group to one with a hydrogen atom, the carbon with the hydrogen atom (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\n### 4. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome\n\n*   The nucleophilic attack occurs at C6 with inversion of configuration.\n*   The starting configuration of C6 is given as **S**.\n*   After the reaction, the configuration at C6 will be inverted to **R**.\n*   The other chiral centers (C1, C3, C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps of the ring-opening. Therefore, their configurations will be retained.\n    *   C1 remains **R**.\n    *   C3 remains **R**.\n    *   C4 remains **R**.\n\n### 5. Identify the Product Structure and Name\n\n*   The reaction opens the epoxide ring. The Me⁻ group forms a new bond with C6. The C6-O bond breaks, and the oxygen atom remains attached to C1. After an aqueous workup (which is implicit in forming the final alcohol product), the oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclohexanol with the following groups:\n    *   An -OH group and a -CH₃ group on C1 (from the starting material).\n    *   A new -CH₃ group on C6 (from the cuprate).\n    *   A -CH₃ group on C3 (from the starting material).\n    *   A -CH₃ group on C4 (from the starting material).\n*   The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol. We need to number the resulting ring according to IUPAC rules for alcohols. The carbon bearing the -OH group is assigned as C1. This corresponds to the original C1.\n*   Next, we number the ring to give the lowest possible locants (numbers) to the substituents (the four methyl groups).\n    *   Methyl groups are on old C1, old C3, old C4, and old C6.\n    *   The new C1 is the old C1. Let's consider the two possible numbering directions:\n        1.  Clockwise: C1(old) -> C2(old) -> C3(old) -> ... The methyl groups are at positions 1, 3, 4, 6. The locant set is {1,3,4,6}.\n        2.  Counter-clockwise: C1(old) -> C6(old) -> C5(old) -> ... Let's denote the new positions. New C1 = old C1, New C2 = old C6, New C3 = old C5, New C4 = old C4, New C5 = old C3. The methyl groups are at New C1, New C2, New C4, New C5. The locant set is {1,2,4,5}.\n    *   Comparing the locant sets {1,3,4,6} and {1,2,4,5}, the second set is lower (at the first point of difference, 2 < 3).\n    *   Therefore, the product is named **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n### 6. Determine the Final Product Stereochemistry\n\nNow we map the stereochemistry from the starting material to the correctly numbered product.\n*   **Product C1** corresponds to **Starting Material C1**. Its configuration is retained. So, it is **R**.\n*   **Product C2** corresponds to **Starting Material C6**. Its configuration is inverted. S -> **R**.\n*   **Product C4** corresponds to **Starting Material C4**. Its configuration is retained. So, it is **R**.\n*   **Product C5** corresponds to **Starting Material C3**. Its configuration is retained. So, it is **R**.\n\nCombining these results, the full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 7. Conclusion\n\nComparing our derived product name with the given options:\nA) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nB) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nC) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nD) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur result, (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
