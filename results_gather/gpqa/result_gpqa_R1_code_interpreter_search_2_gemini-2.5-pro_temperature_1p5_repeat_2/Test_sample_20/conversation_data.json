    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible isomers, known as tautomers. The most common form is **keto-enol tautomerism**, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone)**:\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone consists of a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone (C=O) groups opposite each other.\n    *   Let's examine the carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups. These alpha-carbons are part of the ring's double bonds (`-C=C-C(=O)-C=C-`).\n    *   These alpha-carbons are sp2 hybridized and are bonded to other carbon atoms within the ring, not to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo the standard keto-enol tautomerization. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n    *   This compound has a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are situated between two carbonyl groups. These are alpha-carbons.\n    *   Each of these alpha-carbons is a `CH2` group, meaning it has two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   These hydrogens are highly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. They can easily be removed and moved to one of the carbonyl oxygens to form an enol.\n    *   In fact, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists in equilibrium with its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is aromatic and thus highly stable.\n    *   Since it can form an enol tautomer, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH(OH)-C(=O)O-CH3`.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the -OH group). This carbon is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-C(=O)O-CH3)\n    *   All four of these groups are different. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Chiral molecules exhibit optical isomerism (they exist as a pair of enantiomers).\n    *   Thus, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   The structure is `CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3`. The term \"fumarate\" specifies that it is the *trans* isomer, where the two `-COOCH3` groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Let's look for chiral centers. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbons of the double bond are only bonded to three groups.\n    *   Let's assess the overall symmetry of the molecule. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion (a point in the center of the C=C bond through which you can invert all atoms and get an identical molecule).\n    *   Molecules with a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry are achiral and cannot be optically active.\n    *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer determination:**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
