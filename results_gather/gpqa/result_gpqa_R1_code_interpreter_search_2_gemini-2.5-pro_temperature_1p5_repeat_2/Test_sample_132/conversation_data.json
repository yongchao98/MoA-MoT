    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-).\n\n**1. Identify the chemical species in the solution.**\nThe solution is made by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O) in water.\n*   KH2PO4 is a salt that dissociates completely in water to yield K+ ions and dihydrogen phosphate ions (H2PO4-).\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O is a hydrated salt that dissolves to yield Na+ ions and hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO4^2-).\n\nThe two phosphate species, H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, form a conjugate acid-base pair. This creates a buffer solution. The relevant equilibrium for this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\nH2PO4⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + HPO4²⁻(aq) ; Ka2 = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n\n**2. Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of moles of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ added to the solution.\n\n*   **Moles of H2PO4⁻ (from KH2PO4):**\n    *   Mass of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles\n\n*   **Moles of HPO4²⁻ (from Na2HPO4●2H2O):**\n    *   Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles\n\nNext, we calculate the concentrations using the total volume of the solution.\n*   Volume = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n*   **Concentration of H2PO4⁻:**\n    *   [H2PO4⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n*   **Concentration of HPO4²⁻:**\n    *   [HPO4²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer solution.**\nThe hydrogen ion concentration is determined by the Ka2 equilibrium for the H2PO4⁻/HPO4²⁻ buffer. We can rearrange the equilibrium constant expression:\nKa2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n[H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻).**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO4³⁻) is produced by the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4²⁻). This process is governed by the third acid dissociation constant, Ka3.\nHPO4²⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + PO4³⁻(aq) ; Ka3 = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\nWe can rearrange the Ka3 expression to solve for [PO4³⁻]:\nKa3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n[PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺]\n\nNow, we substitute the known values for [HPO4²⁻], [H⁺], and Ka3:\n[PO4³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO4³⁻] ≈ 6.235x10⁻⁷ M\n\n**5. Final Answer.**\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M. This corresponds to option A.\n\nWe can perform the calculation using a single script for higher precision.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nMw_KH2PO4 = 136.09\nMw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99\n\n# Masses (g)\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00\n\n# Volume (L)\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000\n\n# Acid dissociation constants\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of each component\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / Mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / Mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations of the buffer components\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / volume_L\nconc_HPO4 = moles_HPO4 / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate concentration [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation (Ka3)\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nPO4_conc = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4 / H_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{PO4_conc:.3e}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n6.235e-07\n</execute_code>\nThe result from the code confirms the manual calculation. The concentration is 6.235x10⁻⁷ M, which rounds to 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<A>>>",
