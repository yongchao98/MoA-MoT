    "The problem asks for the kinematically allowed decay modes of a boson X with a mass of $M_X = 6$ GeV. The interaction Lagrangian that describes the coupling of the boson X to fermions is given by:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f (y) (\\upsilon + X(y)) \\psi_f(y) $$\nThe term relevant for the decay of X is the interaction term involving the X field:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{Xff} = -\\lambda_f X(y) \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) \\psi_f(y) $$\nThis term describes the decay of the boson X into a fermion-antifermion pair, $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\nFor a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the decaying particle must be greater than the sum of the masses of the decay products. In this case, for the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$, the condition is:\n$$ M_X > m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} $$\nSince a fermion and its corresponding antifermion have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$$ M_X > 2m_f $$\nGiven that the mass of the boson X is $M_X = 6$ GeV, we must find all fermions $f$ that satisfy:\n$$ 6 \\, \\text{GeV} > 2m_f $$\n$$ 3 \\, \\text{GeV} > m_f $$\nThis means we need to list all fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) whose mass is less than 3 GeV.\n\nLet's list the masses of the fundamental fermions:\n**Leptons:**\n*   Electron ($e$): $m_e \\approx 0.511$ MeV/$c^2$ = 0.000511 GeV/$c^2$\n*   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_\\mu \\approx 105.7$ MeV/$c^2$ = 0.1057 GeV/$c^2$\n*   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777$ GeV/$c^2$\n\n**Quarks:**\n*   Up ($u$): $m_u \\approx 2.2$ MeV/$c^2$ = 0.0022 GeV/$c^2$\n*   Down ($d$): $m_d \\approx 4.7$ MeV/$c^2$ = 0.0047 GeV/$c^2$\n*   Strange ($s$): $m_s \\approx 95$ MeV/$c^2$ = 0.095 GeV/$c^2$\n*   Charm ($c$): $m_c \\approx 1.27$ GeV/$c^2$\n*   Bottom ($b$): $m_b \\approx 4.18$ GeV/$c^2$\n*   Top ($t$): $m_t \\approx 173.1$ GeV/$c^2$\n\n(Note: Neutrinos also exist, but their masses are extremely small and their decay products would be practically undetectable in this context. They are typically omitted from such lists unless specified.)\n\nNow, let's check the condition $m_f < 3$ GeV for each fermion:\n*   $m_e = 0.000511$ GeV < 3 GeV. So, $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is allowed.\n*   $m_\\mu = 0.1057$ GeV < 3 GeV. So, $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is allowed.\n*   $m_\\tau = 1.777$ GeV < 3 GeV. So, $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is allowed.\n*   $m_u = 0.0022$ GeV < 3 GeV. So, $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is allowed.\n*   $m_d = 0.0047$ GeV < 3 GeV. So, $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is allowed.\n*   $m_s = 0.095$ GeV < 3 GeV. So, $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is allowed.\n*   $m_c = 1.27$ GeV < 3 GeV. So, $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is allowed.\n*   $m_b = 4.18$ GeV > 3 GeV. So, $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **not** allowed.\n*   $m_t = 173.1$ GeV > 3 GeV. So, $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **not** allowed.\n\nTherefore, the kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson X are into pairs of electrons, muons, taus, and up, down, strange, and charm quarks.\n\nThe list of allowed decays is:\n$X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}, s\\bar{s}, u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-}$\n\nComparing this list with the given options:\nA) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$\nB) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $b\\bar{b}$)\nC) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $b\\bar{b}$ and excludes $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $c\\bar{c}$)\nD) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $t\\bar{t}$)\n\nOption A correctly lists all the kinematically allowed decay channels.\n\n<<<A>>>"
