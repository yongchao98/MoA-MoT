    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes. So, the molecular weight is 156 g/mol.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2) with an intensity of about 32% relative to the M⁺ peak (100%). This M⁺ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a classic isotopic signature for a compound containing **one chlorine atom**. (Chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with natural abundances of ~75% and ~25%, respectively).\n\nLet's quickly check the molecular weight of the options to see if they match. The general formula for the plausible options is C₇H₅ClO₂.\nMolecular Weight (using ³⁵Cl) = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\nMolecular Weight (using ³⁷Cl) = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 37) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158 g/mol.\nAll the acid and aldehyde options (A, B, D) have this formula and match the mass spec data. Phenyl chloroformate (C) also has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and fits the mass data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic and unmistakable signal for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its position is consistent with the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\nThe IR data strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This makes options B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid) strong candidates, and makes options A (aldehyde/alcohol) and C (chloroformate) highly unlikely.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is diagnostic for a **carboxylic acid proton**. The 's' means it is a singlet (it does not couple with other protons), and '1H' means it represents one proton. This further confirms the presence of a -COOH group.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The splitting pattern is key: there are only two signals, and both are **doublets**.\n    *   The integration shows that each signal represents two protons ('2H').\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-isomer means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and they split each other into doublets.\n\n**Conclusion by Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Inconsistent with IR (not a carboxylic acid) and ¹H NMR (would have a more complex aromatic pattern, an aldehyde proton, and an alcohol proton, but no carboxylic acid proton).\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is a **para-substituted** chlorinated benzoic acid. It is perfectly consistent with all the data:\n    *   **MS:** MW = 156, contains one Cl. (Correct)\n    *   **IR:** Has a carboxylic acid group. (Correct)\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Has a carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm) and a para-substituted aromatic ring (two doublets, each 2H). (Correct)\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** Inconsistent with IR and ¹H NMR as it lacks a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is an **ortho-substituted** benzoic acid. While it matches the MS and IR data (it's a carboxylic acid with MW=156), its ¹H NMR spectrum would be much more complex. Due to the lack of symmetry, it would show four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, not two simple doublets. Therefore, it is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\nThe only structure that fits all the provided spectral information is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
