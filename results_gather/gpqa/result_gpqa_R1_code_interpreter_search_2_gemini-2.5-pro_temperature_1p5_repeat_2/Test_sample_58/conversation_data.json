    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n    *   **CH3COOH (a weak acid):**\n        *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n        *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol\n    *   **HCl (a strong acid):**\n        *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n        *   Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol\n        *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.08 moles of H+ ions.\n    *   **Ba(OH)2 (a strong base):**\n        *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n        *   Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n        *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates completely according to the equation: Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻. Therefore, the moles of OH⁻ ions are twice the moles of Ba(OH)2.\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the neutralization reactions.** The strong base (OH⁻) will react first with the strong acid (H⁺), as this reaction goes to completion.\n\n    *   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.08 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.18 mol\n    *   The H⁺ ions are the limiting reactant. They will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining after reacting with HCl = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n3.  **React the remaining strong species with the weak species.** The remaining strong base (OH⁻) will now react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n    *   Reaction: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.10 mol\n    *   The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant in this step. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ consumed = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (acetate) produced = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n4.  **Determine the final composition of the solution.**\n    *   After all reactions, the solution contains an excess of a strong base (0.05 mol of OH⁻) and a weak base (0.05 mol of CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   The presence of a strong base (OH⁻) will dominate the solution's pH. The contribution to the hydroxide concentration from the weak base (CH₃COO⁻) is negligible due to the common ion effect and can be ignored.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final pH.**\n    *   First, calculate the total volume of the final solution:\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n    *   Next, calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻ ions:\n        *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.\n    *   Now, calculate the pOH:\n        *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.\n    *   Finally, calculate the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14:\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial moles\nmoles_CH3COOH = 0.1 * 0.5  # 0.05 mol\nmoles_HCl = 0.2 * 0.4      # 0.08 mol\nmoles_BaOH2 = 0.3 * 0.3    # 0.09 mol\n\nmoles_H_strong = moles_HCl\nmoles_OH_strong = 2 * moles_BaOH2 # 0.18 mol\n\n# Step 2: Neutralize strong acid and strong base\n# OH- is in excess\nmoles_OH_after_strong_acid_reaction = moles_OH_strong - moles_H_strong # 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol\n\n# Step 3: React remaining strong base with weak acid\n# OH- is still in excess\nmoles_OH_final_excess = moles_OH_after_strong_acid_reaction - moles_CH3COOH # 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol\n\n# Step 4 & 5: Calculate final pH from excess strong base\ntotal_volume_L = 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.3  # 1.2 L\nconcentration_OH_final = moles_OH_final_excess / total_volume_L\n\npOH = -math.log10(concentration_OH_final)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f'{pH=:.2f}')\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "An analysis of the chemical reaction shows there is an excess of a strong base. The pH is calculated as follows:\n1.  **Calculate moles of each species:**\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid) = 0.500 L × 0.1 M = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid) = 0.400 L × 0.2 M = 0.08 mol.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base) = 0.300 L × 0.3 M × 2 = 0.18 mol.\n\n2.  **Neutralization reaction:** The strong base (OH⁻) neutralizes the acids. It will first react with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) and then with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ to be neutralized = 0.08 mol (from HCl) + 0.05 mol (from CH₃COOH) = 0.13 mol.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.18 mol.\n    *   Since moles of OH⁻ > moles of H⁺, the base is in excess.\n    *   Moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.18 mol - 0.13 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻:**\n    *   Total volume of the solution = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
