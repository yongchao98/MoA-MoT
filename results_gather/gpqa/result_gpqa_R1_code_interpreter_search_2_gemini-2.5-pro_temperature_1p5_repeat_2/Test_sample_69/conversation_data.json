    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical riddle:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Clue 3 - The Hydrolysis Reaction\n**Clue:** \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"\n*   `C + H₂O → A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`\n*   This reaction is the most chemically descriptive. A substance C hydrolyzes to give back the starting material A and two different acids. This strongly suggests that C is a complex or adduct that releases a substance upon hydrolysis, which then disproportionates in water.\n*   The substance released must be the components of gas B. So, let's find a gaseous substance `B` whose hydrolysis products are a strong acid and a weak acid.\n*   Let's consider oxides of non-metals.\n    *   `N₂O₄(g) + H₂O → HNO₃ (strong) + HNO₂ (weak)`. This is a possibility. Let's call it Hypothesis 1.\n    *   `2ClO₂(g) + H₂O → HClO₃ (strong) + HClO₂ (weak)`. (Note: this disproportionation happens in basic solution, followed by acidification, but is a common feature in such riddles). This is also an excellent candidate. Let's call it Hypothesis 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Clue 4 - Formation of the Solvent H\n**Clue:** \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\n*   Let's test our hypotheses for B.\n*   **Hypothesis 1 (B = N₂O₄):** `D(g) + N₂O₄(g) → H(solvent)`. There is no common 1:1 reaction of N₂O₄ with a gas D to form a solvent. N₂O₄ itself is a solvent. This hypothesis is weak here.\n*   **Hypothesis 2 (B = ClO₂):** `D(g) + ClO₂(g) → H(solvent)`. Chlorine dioxide (ClO₂) is a highly reactive radical. Let's look for a 1:1 reaction with another gas `D`. The reaction with ozone (O₃) is known:\n    `2ClO₂ + 2O₃ → Cl₂O₆ + 2O₂`\n    The reactant ratio of ClO₂ to O₃ is 1:1. The product `Cl₂O₆` (dichlorine hexoxide) is a dark red liquid at room temperature and can be considered a non-aqueous solvent. This fits the clue perfectly.\n*   This makes Hypothesis 2 very strong. We can identify:\n    *   **B = ClO₂** (Chlorine dioxide)\n    *   **D = O₃** (Ozone)\n    *   **H = Cl₂O₆** (Dichlorine hexoxide)\n    *   **F = HClO₃** (Chloric acid)\n    *   **G = HClO₂** (Chlorous acid)\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Clue 1 - Formation of Product C\n**Clue:** \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"\n*   Using our identities: `A(s) + 8ClO₂(g) → C(red)`\n*   And from Clue 3, `C` must release `A` and `ClO₂` upon hydrolysis. This suggests `C` is a complex or adduct. The stoichiometry suggests a formula like `A(ClO₂)₈`.\n*   What could `A` be? Iodine (`I₂`) is a solid that forms numerous colored complexes and clathrates (cage compounds) and is known to be reformed after its compounds react. Let's propose that `A` is Iodine.\n*   **A = I₂**\n*   `C` could be a clathrate or complex `I₂(ClO₂)₈`. Iodine and chlorine dioxide are both colored, so a \"bright red product\" is plausible.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Clue 2 - Formation of the Hazardous Product E\n**Clue:** \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n*   Using our identities: `I₂(ClO₂)₈ (C) + 2O₃ (D) → E (hazardous)`\n*   This reaction involves strong oxidizing agents (ClO₂, O₃). The product E is likely an oxide of chlorine or iodine. The reaction \"produces E\" implies E is a notable product, not necessarily the only one.\n*   Given the reactants (chlorine and oxygen) and the description \"extremely hazardous,\" high-oxidation-state chlorine oxides are prime candidates. `Cl₂O₇` (dichlorine heptoxide) is a powerful oxidizing agent that is sensitive to shock and heat, making it explosive and thus \"extremely hazardous\".\n*   Let's tentatively identify **E = Cl₂O₇**.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E\n*   The final question is to find the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E. We have identified E as `Cl₂O₇`.\n*   The structure of `Cl₂O₇` consists of two `ClO₃` pyramidal groups joined by a bridging oxygen atom (`O₃Cl-O-ClO₃`). The `Cl-O-Cl` bond is bent. The two `ClO₃` groups are twisted relative to one another.\n*   Let's analyze the symmetry elements:\n    *   There is no plane of symmetry (`σ`).\n    *   There is no center of inversion (`i`).\n    *   There is a single two-fold axis of rotation (`C₂`) that passes through the bridging oxygen atom and bisects the `Cl-O-Cl` angle.\n*   A molecule that has only a `C₂` axis of rotation as its symmetry element belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nFinal check of all identified substances:\n*   **A:** I₂ (Iodine)\n*   **B:** ClO₂ (Chlorine dioxide)\n*   **C:** I₂(ClO₂)₈ (Iodine-chlorine dioxide complex)\n*   **D:** O₃ (Ozone)\n*   **E:** Cl₂O₇ (Dichlorine heptoxide)\n*   **F:** HClO₃ (Chloric acid)\n*   **G:** HClO₂ (Chlorous acid)\n*   **H:** Cl₂O₆ (Dichlorine hexoxide)\n\nThe chemical logic is consistent. The point group of E (Cl₂O₇) is C₂.\n\n```python\n# This problem is a chemical riddle that requires logical deduction of the identities\n# of several unknown substances based on their reactions. The final question is about\n# the molecular symmetry of product E. The thought process above walks through the\n# deduction steps.\n#\n# Step 1: Identify B, F, and G from the hydrolysis clue.\n#   Clue: C + H2O -> A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid).\n#   This suggests B disproportionates in water. Two main candidates:\n#   1) N2O4 -> HNO3 + HNO2\n#   2) ClO2 -> HClO3 + HClO2\n# Step 2: Identify D and H from the 1:1 reaction clue.\n#   Clue: D + B -> H(solvent) [1:1]\n#   If B = N2O4, there's no obvious 1:1 reaction.\n#   If B = ClO2, the reaction 2O3 + 2ClO2 -> Cl2O6 + 2O2 is a 1:1 reaction between\n#   reactants D=O3 and B=ClO2 to form H=Cl2O6 (a liquid/solvent). This works.\n#   So: B=ClO2, D=O3, H=Cl2O6, F=HClO3, G=HClO2.\n# Step 3: Identify A and C.\n#   Clue: A(s) + 8B(g) -> C(red) and C hydrolyzes back to A.\n#   This suggests A is a host for B. Iodine (I2) is a solid that forms many colored\n#   complexes. Let A = I2. C would be a complex like I2(ClO2)8.\n# Step 4: Identify E.\n#   Clue: C + 2D -> E(hazardous).\n#   I2(ClO2)8 + 2O3 -> E.\n#   The reaction involves powerful oxidants. E is likely a high-oxidation state chlorine oxide.\n#   Dichlorine heptoxide (Cl2O7) is a plausible candidate. It is a hazardous, explosive oil.\n# Step 5: Determine the symmetry of E.\n#   The molecule is E = Cl2O7. Its structure is O3Cl-O-ClO3 with a bent Cl-O-Cl angle\n#   and the two ClO3 groups twisted relative to each other.\n#   This structure possesses only one symmetry element: a C2 rotation axis passing through\n#   the bridging oxygen. Therefore, its point group is C2.\n#   This matches option D in the multiple-choice question.\n\nprint(\"Based on the deductive reasoning:\")\nprint(\"A = I2\")\nprint(\"B = ClO2\")\nprint(\"C = I2(ClO2)8 (hypothetical complex)\")\nprint(\"D = O3\")\nprint(\"E = Cl2O7\")\nprint(\"F = HClO3\")\nprint(\"G = HClO2\")\nprint(\"H = Cl2O6\")\nprint(\"The molecular symmetry group (point group) of E (Cl2O7) is C2.\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option D.\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Hydrolysis Reaction (Clue 3):**\n    *   `C + H₂O → A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`\n    *   This is the most revealing clue. The reaction shows that C, when hydrolyzed, regenerates the starting material A and produces two acids. This implies that the components of gas B, which make up part of C, are what hydrolyze. This type of reaction, where a single substance produces two acids (one in a higher oxidation state, one in a lower), is a disproportionation.\n    *   Let's consider oxides of non-metals that are gases and disproportionate in water. A classic example is chlorine dioxide (`ClO₂`). While the reaction is more complex in reality, for a puzzle context, it can be represented as disproportionating to form chloric acid (HClO₃, a strong acid) and chlorous acid (HClO₂, a weak acid).\n    *   Hypothesis: `B` is `ClO₂`, `F` is `HClO₃`, and `G` is `HClO₂`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Solvent Formation (Clue 4):**\n    *   `D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Let's test our hypothesis that `B` is `ClO₂`. Is there a 1:1 reaction between `ClO₂` and another gas `D` that forms a substance `H` used as a solvent?\n    *   The reaction between chlorine dioxide (`ClO₂`) and ozone (`O₃`) fits this description:\n        `2O₃(g) + 2ClO₂(g) → Cl₂O₆(l) + 2O₂(g)`\n    *   Here, the molar ratio of the reactants `D` (`O₃`) to `B` (`ClO₂`) is 1:1. The product, dichlorine hexoxide (`Cl₂O₆`), is a dark-red liquid at room temperature and can be considered a specialized non-aqueous solvent.\n    *   This strongly supports our initial hypothesis and allows us to identify:\n        *   **B = ClO₂** (chlorine dioxide)\n        *   **D = O₃** (ozone)\n        *   **H = Cl₂O₆** (dichlorine hexoxide)\n\n3.  **Analyze the Formation of C and E:**\n    *   **Clue 1:** `A(s) + 8B(g) → C(bright red)`\n        *   `A(s) + 8ClO₂(g) → C`\n        *   Since `C` reforms `A` upon hydrolysis, `A` must be a solid that can form a complex or adduct with `ClO₂`. Iodine (`I₂`) is a common solid halogen that forms such colored complexes. Let's assume **A = I₂**. Then `C` is a complex, likely `I₂(ClO₂)₈`.\n    *   **Clue 2:** `C + 2D(g) → E(extremely hazardous)`\n        *   `I₂(ClO₂)₈ + 2O₃ → E`\n        *   This reaction involves powerful oxidizing agents (`ClO₂`, `O₃`). The product `E` is described as extremely hazardous, which points towards a highly reactive and potentially explosive substance. A prominent candidate is dichlorine heptoxide (`Cl₂O₇`), an oily liquid that is a powerful oxidizing agent and can detonate with shock or heat.\n        *   Let's identify **E = Cl₂O₇**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n    *   We have identified `E` as dichlorine heptoxide, `Cl₂O₇`.\n    *   The structure of `Cl₂O₇` is `O₃Cl-O-ClO₃`. It consists of two `ClO₃` groups linked by a bridging oxygen atom.\n    *   The `Cl-O-Cl` bond is bent (approximately 118.6°).\n    *   Crucially, the two `ClO₃` groups are twisted relative to each other along the `Cl-O-Cl` axis.\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry elements of this structure:\n        *   There is no mirror plane (`σ`) that can cut the molecule into two identical halves.\n        *   There is no center of inversion (`i`).\n        *   There is no rotation axis higher than `C₂`.\n        *   There is a single two-fold (`C₂`) axis of rotation that passes through the central, bridging oxygen atom and bisects the `Cl-O-Cl` angle.\n    *   A molecule that possesses only a `C₂` rotational axis as its non-identity symmetry element belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is C₂.\n\n<<<D>>>"
