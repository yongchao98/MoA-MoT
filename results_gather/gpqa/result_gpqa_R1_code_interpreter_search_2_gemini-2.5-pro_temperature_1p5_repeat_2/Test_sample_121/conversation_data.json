    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the reaction pathway and the structure of each product.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. The alpha-carbon of the carboxylic acid is brominated.\n    *   Starting material: Acetic acid (CH3COOH)\n    *   The alpha-carbon is the methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Product 1:** α-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n    *   The -OH of the carboxyl group is replaced by the -OCH2CH3 group from ethanol.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN-) is a strong nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion via an SN2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes a proton from the alpha-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. This carbon is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt), making its protons acidic.\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br(CH2)5Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since *excess* NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining proton on the alpha-carbon, which is still acidic.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion on the alpha-carbon now attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a cyclic compound. The ring is formed from the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the final product (4) for symmetry.**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n```\n      CN\n      |\n      C  (C1)\n     / \\\n  H2C   CH2 (C2, C6)\n  |     |\n  H2C   CH2 (C3, C5)\n     \\ /\n      CH2 (C4)\n      |\n      C=O\n      |\n      O\n      |\n      CH2\n      |\n      CH3\n```\n\nThis molecule is achiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the C1 and C4 atoms of the ring, as well as the cyano and ethyl carboxylate substituents. This symmetry has important consequences for the NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals (¹H NMR).**\n\nWe need to count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n\n1.  **The Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH2-) are enantiotopic because they are mirror images across the molecule's plane of symmetry. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **The Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons equivalent: C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5. C4 is unique.\n    *   In a substituted cyclohexane ring, the two protons on each CH2 group (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent and will give separate signals.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6 (4H total):** The two carbons are equivalent. The axial proton on C2 is equivalent to the axial proton on C6. The equatorial proton on C2 is equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. However, the axial and equatorial protons themselves are non-equivalent. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5 (4H total):** Similar to the above, the axial protons are equivalent to each other, and the equatorial protons are equivalent to each other, but axial and equatorial are distinct. This gives another **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4 (2H total):** This carbon is unique. Its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Summary of Signals:**\n*   Ethyl -CH3: 1 signal\n*   Ethyl -OCH2-: 1 signal\n*   Ring C2/C6 protons: 2 signals\n*   Ring C3/C5 protons: 2 signals\n*   Ring C4 protons: 2 signals\n\nTotal distinct signals = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8**.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the ¹H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
