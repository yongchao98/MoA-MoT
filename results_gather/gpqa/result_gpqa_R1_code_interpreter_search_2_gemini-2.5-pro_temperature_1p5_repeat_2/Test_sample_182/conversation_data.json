    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant**\n    The reactant is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\". Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula.\n    *   **Parent Structure**: `cyclohex-3-ene` is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbons 3 and 4. A ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation. The double bond adds another.\n    *   **Principal Functional Group**: `carboxylic acid` (-COOH) is at position 1. This group contains a C=O double bond.\n    *   **Substituents**:\n        *   A `formyl` group (-CHO, an aldehyde) is at position 2. This group also contains a C=O double bond.\n        *   A `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) is at position 5. This group contains a C=C double bond.\n\n    Now, let's determine the molecular formula of the reactant (C10H12O3):\n    *   **Carbons (C)**: 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H)**: We can deduce this from the structure. A systematic count gives 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens (O)**: 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n    The molecular formula is C10H12O3.\n\n    Let's calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant to verify our structural analysis.\n    IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    IHD = 10 - (12/2) + 0 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n    This matches the structural features: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in aldehyde) = 5.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**\n    The reagent is **red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its effect on the functional groups present in the reactant is as follows:\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: It gets completely reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Aldehyde (-CHO)**: It also gets completely reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Alkenes (C=C)**: Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the vinyl group are reduced to single bonds (C-C). The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) becomes an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n    *   **Ring Structure**: The cyclohexane ring itself is stable and does not open under these conditions.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product**\n    The reaction reduces all sites of unsaturation (except the ring itself) and removes all oxygen atoms.\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` core becomes a `cyclohexane` core.\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` at C1 becomes a `methyl group`.\n    *   The `formyl group` at C2 becomes a `methyl group`.\n    *   The `vinyl group` at C5 becomes an `ethyl group`.\n    The final product is a substituted cyclohexane (an isomer of 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane). The exact stereochemistry and IUPAC name are not necessary to find the molecular formula.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of the Product**\n    The reaction does not change the number of carbon atoms. So, the product still has 10 carbon atoms (C10).\n    The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for such a compound is CnH2n.\n    Since n = 10, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n    The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) for the product C10H20 can be calculated using the formula:\n    IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n    This result makes perfect sense. The final product is a saturated alkane skeleton which has only one structural feature causing hydrogen deficiency: the single ring. A single ring always corresponds to an IHD of 1.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
