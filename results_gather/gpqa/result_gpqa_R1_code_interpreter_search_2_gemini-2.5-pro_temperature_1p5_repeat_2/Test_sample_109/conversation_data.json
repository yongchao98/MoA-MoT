    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Observability Criteria\n\nFor a star to be detected by **both** the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, it must satisfy two conditions:\n\n*   **Location Condition:** It must be visible from both observatory locations.\n*   **Brightness Condition:** Its apparent V magnitude must be within the detection limits of both instruments.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Location Condition\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located in Chile, in the Southern Hemisphere. Its latitude is approximately 24.6° South (-24.6°).\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located in Hawaii, in the Northern Hemisphere. Its latitude is approximately 19.8° North (+19.8°).\n\nAn observatory can observe stars that rise above its local horizon. The declination (DEC) of a star determines its path across the sky.\n*   For Keck Observatory (latitude ≈ +20°), the observable declination range is roughly from -70° to +90°.\n*   For Paranal Observatory (latitude ≈ -25°), the observable declination range is roughly from -90° to +65°.\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range, which is approximately **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n\nThe problem states to \"disregard the pointing limits\", which simplifies this. We will just check if the star's declination falls within this common visibility window, ruling out stars at extreme southern or northern declinations that can only be seen from one hemisphere.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Brightness Condition\n\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit:** Apparent V magnitude < 17.0\n*   **HIRES Limit:** Apparent V magnitude < 16.0\n\nFor a star to be detected by **both** spectrographs, it must be bright enough for the less sensitive instrument, which is HIRES. Therefore, the combined brightness condition is:\n**Apparent V magnitude (V) < 16.0**\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Star\n\nWe will now calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and check if it meets both the location (declination) and brightness conditions.\n\n**Key Formulas:**\n*   **Distance Modulus:** V = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d) - 5\n    *   V = Apparent V magnitude\n    *   M_V = Absolute V magnitude\n    *   d = distance in parsecs (pc)\n*   **Interstellar Extinction:** V_observed = V_unreddened + A_V\n    *   A_V = Total absorption in V-band\n    *   A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) (as given in the problem)\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef check_star_visibility(star_name, dec, V_mag):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a star is visible based on declination and magnitude.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Location Check: Is declination between -70 and +65 degrees?\n    dec_visible = -70 < dec < 65\n    \n    # Brightness Check: Is apparent V magnitude < 16.0?\n    mag_visible = V_mag < 16.0\n    \n    # Overall Visibility: Must satisfy both\n    is_visible = dec_visible and mag_visible\n    \n    print(f\"--- {star_name} ---\")\n    print(f\"Declination (DEC): {dec:.2f} deg\")\n    print(f\"Apparent Magnitude (V): {V_mag:.2f} mag\")\n    print(f\"Visible from both locations (DEC)? {'Yes' if dec_visible else 'No'}\")\n    print(f\"Bright enough for both instruments (V < 16.0)? {'Yes' if mag_visible else 'No'}\")\n    print(f\"Observable by BOTH? {'Yes' if is_visible else 'No'}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n    return is_visible\n\n# --- Star 1 ---\n# DEC = -75 deg, M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc\ndec1 = -75\nM_V1 = 15.5\nd1 = 10\n# V = M_V + 5*log10(d) - 5\nV1 = M_V1 + 5 * math.log10(d1) - 5\ncheck_star_visibility(\"Star 1\", dec1, V1)\n\n# --- Star 2 ---\n# DEC = 55 deg, V = 16.5 mag\ndec2 = 55\nV2 = 16.5\ncheck_star_visibility(\"Star 2\", dec2, V2)\n\n# --- Star 3 ---\n# DEC = 48 deg, V = 15.5 mag (assumed observed magnitude)\ndec3 = 48\nV3 = 15.5\ncheck_star_visibility(\"Star 3\", dec3, V3)\n\n# --- Star 4 ---\n# DEC = -48 deg, M_V = 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag, d = 10 pc\ndec4 = -48\nM_V4 = 15.5\nd4 = 10\nE_BV4 = 0.4\n# V_unreddened = M_V + 5*log10(d) - 5\nV_unreddened4 = M_V4 + 5 * math.log10(d4) - 5\nA_V4 = 3.1 * E_BV4\nV4 = V_unreddened4 + A_V4\ncheck_star_visibility(\"Star 4\", dec4, V4)\n\n# --- Star 5 ---\n# DEC = 60 deg, M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc\ndec5 = 60\nM_V5 = 16.5\nd5 = 5\n# V = M_V + 5*log10(d) - 5\nV5 = M_V5 + 5 * math.log10(d5) - 5\ncheck_star_visibility(\"Star 5\", dec5, V5)\n```\n<execution_outputs>\n--- Star 1 ---\nDeclination (DEC): -75.00 deg\nApparent Magnitude (V): 15.50 mag\nVisible from both locations (DEC)?

Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis and the code execution:\n\n*   **Star 1:** Is not observable because its declination of -75° is too far south to be seen from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii.\n*   **Star 2:** Is not observable because its apparent magnitude of 16.5 is too faint for the HIRES spectrograph (which requires V < 16).\n*   **Star 3:** Is observable. Its declination of +48° is visible from both hemispheres, and its apparent magnitude of 15.5 is brighter than the V < 16 limit.\n*   **Star 4:** Is not observable. Although its location is fine, its calculated apparent magnitude of 16.74 (after accounting for dust extinction) is too faint for the HIRES spectrograph.\n*   **Star 5:** Is observable. Its declination of +60° is visible from both hemispheres, and its calculated apparent magnitude of 14.99 is brighter than the V < 16 limit.\n\nTherefore, the two stars that can be detected by both instruments are **Star 3 and Star 5**.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The analysis of each star is based on two criteria:\n1.  **Location:** The star must be visible from both the Northern Hemisphere (Keck) and the Southern Hemisphere (Paranal). This means its declination (DEC) must be within a shared visibility window, roughly between -70° and +65°.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the limit of the less sensitive instrument (HIRES). Therefore, the apparent V magnitude must be less than 16.0.\n\nHere is a summary of the results from the executed code:\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   Declination = -75°. **Not visible** from Keck Observatory (Northern Hemisphere).\n    *   Result: Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   Apparent V magnitude = 16.5. This is **too faint** for the HIRES spectrograph (V < 16.0).\n    *   Result: Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   Declination = 48°. **Visible** from both observatories.\n    *   Apparent V magnitude = 15.5. This is **bright enough** for both instruments (15.5 < 16.0).\n    *   Result: **Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   Declination = -48°. **Visible** from both observatories.\n    *   Calculated Apparent V magnitude = 16.74. This is **too faint** for the HIRES spectrograph (16.74 > 16.0).\n    *   Result: Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   Declination = 60°. **Visible** from both observatories.\n    *   Calculated Apparent V magnitude = 14.99. This is **bright enough** for both instruments (14.99 < 16.0).\n    *   Result: **Observable by both.**\n\nTherefore, the only stars that can be detected by both instruments are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
