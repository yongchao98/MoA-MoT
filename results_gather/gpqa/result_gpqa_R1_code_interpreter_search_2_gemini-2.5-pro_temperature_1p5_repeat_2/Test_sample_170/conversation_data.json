    "This problem requires arranging six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer upon electrophilic bromination. The key to solving this is to understand the directing effects (ortho/para vs. meta) and the factors influencing the ratio of isomers (steric and electronic effects).\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents on the benzene ring (`C6H5-`) as either ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the ortho and para positions. They generally lead to a high yield of the para isomer.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro): Deactivating, but o,p-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The yields of ortho and para isomers are very low.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl ester): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n\nSince meta-directors produce very little para product, and o,p-directors produce a significant amount, the three meta-directing compounds will come first in the order (lowest para yield), followed by the three ortho, para-directing compounds.\n\n**Step 2: Order the meta-directing compounds.**\n\nFor meta-directors (`-NO2`, `-COOH`, `-COOC2H5`), the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield of this byproduct is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A more strongly deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in even less of the ortho and para isomers.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5`.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of their deactivating strength:\n`C6H5-NO2` (4) < `C6H5-COOH` (6) < `C6H5-COOC2H5` (2)\n\n*   Para-yield for nitration of nitrobenzene is ~1%.\n*   Para-yield for bromination of benzoic acid is ~1-2%.\n*   Para-yield for nitration of ethyl benzoate is ~4%.\n\nSo the first part of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the ortho, para-directing compounds.**\n\nFor o,p-directors (`-CH3`, `-C2H5`, `-Cl`), we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product. A higher para/ortho ratio means a higher yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** Both are alkyl groups. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para product than toluene.\n    *   Bromination of toluene (1) gives ~62% para product.\n    *   Bromination of ethylbenzene (5) gives ~73% para product.\n    *   So, the order is: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is o,p-directing due to its +R (resonance) effect, but deactivating due to its strong -I (inductive) effect. The inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para substitution.\n    *   Bromination of chlorobenzene (3) gives ~87% para product.\n\n*   **Combining the o,p-directors:** Based on the approximate percentage yields:\n    *   Toluene (1): ~62% para\n    *   Ethylbenzene (5): ~73% para\n    *   Chlorobenzene (3): ~87% para\n    *   The order of increasing para yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine all substances into the final order.**\n\nFirst, we list the meta-directors in order of increasing para yield, followed by the ortho, para-directors in their respective order.\n\n*   Meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nCombining them gives the final sequence: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
