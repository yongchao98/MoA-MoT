    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio of Temperatures:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 as:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]\n\n    The problem states that the star is the same for both planets (so T_star and R_star are constant) and that the albedos are the same (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (2 * a_2 / R_star))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    This means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n4.  **Relate Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity:** The Doppler shift (Δλ) in a star's spectral line is caused by its motion along our line of sight (radial velocity, v_r). The relationship is:\n    Δλ / λ_0 = v_r / c\n    where λ_0 is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem gives the maximum periodic shift, which corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, known as the RV semi-amplitude (K).\n    K = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\n\n    From this, we can find the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes for the two planets' effects on the star:\n    K1 / K2 = [c * (Δλ_1 / λ_0)] / [c * (Δλ_2 / λ_0)] = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n    K1 / K2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\n5.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a) by the following formula (assuming we observe the system edge-on, i.e., sin(i)=1, which gives the maximum shift):\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * v_p\n    where v_p is the planet's orbital velocity, v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a) (assuming M_p << M_star).\n    So, K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))\n\n6.  **Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    K^2 = M_p^2 * G / (a * M_star)\n    a = (G / M_star) * (M_p^2 / K^2)\n\n    Now we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\n    a_2 / a_1 = [(G / M_star) * (M_p2^2 / K2^2)] / [(G / M_star) * (M_p1^2 / K1^2)]\n    The term (G / M_star) cancels out:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratios and Final Value:** We have the necessary ratios:\n    *   Mass ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5/7\n    *   RV ratio: K1 / K2 = 3/4\n\n    Substitute these into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\n    Finally, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28\n\n8.  **Compute the Numerical Result:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\n# M_p1 = 7 Earth masses, M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n# d_lambda_1 = 0.03 Å, d_lambda_2 = 0.04 Å\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is given by sqrt(a_2 / a_1).\n# The semi-major axis 'a' is proportional to (M_p / K)^2, where K is the RV semi-amplitude.\n# K is proportional to the Doppler shift d_lambda.\n# So, a is proportional to (M_p / d_lambda)^2.\n# Therefore, a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / d_lambda_2)^2 / (M_p1 / d_lambda_1)^2\n# a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (d_lambda_1 / d_lambda_2)^2\n\n# Ratios\nmass_ratio_2_over_1 = 5 / 7\ndoppler_ratio_1_over_2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# Ratio of semi-major axes (a_2 / a_1)\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (mass_ratio_2_over_1**2) * (doppler_ratio_1_over_2**2)\n\n# Ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2)\nT_eq_ratio_1_over_2 = a_ratio_2_over_1**0.5\n\n# An even simpler way: T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2/a_1) = (M_p2/M_p1) * (d_lambda_1/d_lambda_2)\nfinal_ratio = (5/7) * (0.03/0.04)\n\nprint(final_ratio)\n```\n\n>>>0.5357142857142857\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nwhere:\n- T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n- R_star is the star's radius.\n- a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- A is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2), we can write:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_1)^(-1/2) / (a_2)^(-1/2) = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a_2 / a_1). We can relate the semi-major axis to the radial velocity (RV) data.\n\nThe maximum radial velocity of the star (the RV semi-amplitude, K) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))\n(where M_p is the planet mass, M_star is the star mass, G is the gravitational constant, and we assume M_p << M_star).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for `a`:\nK^2 = M_p^2 * G / (a * M_star)\na = G * M_p^2 / (K^2 * M_star)\n\nThe Doppler shift (Δλ) is proportional to the radial velocity (v_r), and thus the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max) is proportional to the RV semi-amplitude (K).\nΔλ_max / λ_0 = K / c  => K = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\nSo, K is directly proportional to Δλ_max. Let's denote Δλ_max as just Δλ.\nK ∝ Δλ\n\nNow we can substitute this into our equation for `a`:\na ∝ M_p^2 / (Δλ)^2\n\nLet's form the ratio a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = [M_p2^2 / (Δλ_2)^2] / [M_p1^2 / (Δλ_1)^2]\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\nFinally, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\nNow we can plug in the given values:\n- M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n- M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n- Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n- Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 M_earth / 7 M_earth) * (0.03 Å / 0.04 Å)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5/7) * (3/4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
