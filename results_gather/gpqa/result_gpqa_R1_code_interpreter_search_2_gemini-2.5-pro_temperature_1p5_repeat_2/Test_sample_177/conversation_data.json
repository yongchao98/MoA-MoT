    "This problem requires us to perform dimensional analysis in the context of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) to determine the mass dimension of a coupling constant `κ` and then to assess the renormalizability of the theory based on this dimension.\n\n### **1. Dimensional Analysis Principles**\n\nIn natural units (where `ħ = c = 1`), mass, energy, and momentum have a mass dimension of +1, while length and time have a mass dimension of -1.\nThe action `S` is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density `L` over spacetime:\n`S = ∫ d⁴x L`\n\nFor the path integral formalism to make sense, the action `S` must be a dimensionless quantity.\nThe spacetime volume element `d⁴x` has a mass dimension of `[length]⁴`, which is `[mass]⁻⁴`.\nTherefore, for `S` to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of +4.\n`[S] = [d⁴x] [L] = [M]⁻⁴ [M]⁴ = [M]⁰ = 1` (dimensionless).\nSo, `[L] = 4`.\n\n### **2. Mass Dimension of Fields**\n\nWe determine the mass dimension of the fields from their kinetic terms in the standard Lagrangian.\n\n*   **Fermion field `ψ`:** The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is `L_Dirac = iψ̄γ^μ∂_μψ`.\n    The total dimension must be 4: `[L_Dirac] = 4`.\n    We have `[L_Dirac] = [ψ̄] + [γ^μ] + [∂_μ] + [ψ]`.\n    The partial derivative `∂_μ = ∂/∂x^μ` has a dimension of `[mass]¹ / [length]¹ = [M]¹`.\n    The gamma matrices `γ^μ` are dimensionless matrices, so `[γ^μ] = 0`.\n    By convention, `[ψ̄] = [ψ]`.\n    So, the equation for the dimensions is: `4 = [ψ] + 0 + 1 + [ψ] = 2[ψ] + 1`.\n    Solving for `[ψ]`, we get `2[ψ] = 3`, which means `[ψ] = 3/2`.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor `F^{μν}`:** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field (a U(1) gauge field) is `L_EM = -1/4 F_{μν}F^{μν}`.\n    The total dimension must be 4: `[L_EM] = 4`.\n    We have `[L_EM] = [F_{μν}] + [F^{μν}] = 2[F^{μν}]`.\n    So, `4 = 2[F^{μν}]`, which gives `[F^{μν}] = 2`.\n\n### **3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling `κ`**\n\nNow we analyze the given interaction Lagrangian:\n`L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}`\n\nThe total dimension of this term must also be 4: `[L_int] = 4`.\nThe dimension of the term is the sum of the dimensions of its components:\n`[L_int] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ_{μν}] + [ψ] + [F^{μν}]`.\n\nLet's look at `σ_{μν} = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. Since the gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless, their commutator is also dimensionless. Thus, `[σ_{μν}] = 0`.\n\nNow, we can substitute the known dimensions into the equation:\n`4 = [κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2`\n`4 = [κ] + 3 + 2`\n`4 = [κ] + 5`\nSolving for `[κ]`, we find:\n`[κ] = 4 - 5 = -1`.\n\nSo, the mass dimension of `κ` is -1.\n\n### **4. Renormalizability**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by power-counting, which relies on the mass dimension of the coupling constants of the interaction terms.\nThe classification is as follows:\n*   **Super-renormalizable (Relevant operator):** The coupling constant `g` has a positive mass dimension, `[g] > 0`.\n*   **Renormalizable (Marginal operator):** The coupling constant `g` is dimensionless, `[g] = 0`.\n*   **Non-renormalizable (Irrelevant operator):** The coupling constant `g` has a negative mass dimension, `[g] < 0`.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant `κ` has a mass dimension of `[κ] = -1`. Since this is negative, the interaction term is non-renormalizable. Non-renormalizable theories are typically treated as effective field theories, valid only up to a certain energy scale. At higher energies, the perturbative expansion breaks down, and new physics is expected to appear.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of `κ` is `[κ] = -1`.\n*   Because the mass dimension of the coupling constant is negative, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
