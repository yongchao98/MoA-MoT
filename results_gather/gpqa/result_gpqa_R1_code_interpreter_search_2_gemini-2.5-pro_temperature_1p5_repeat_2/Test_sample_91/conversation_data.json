    "This problem requires calculating the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) of a given organic molecule. The enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\n\nThe formula for calculating the enthalpy of formation using atomization enthalpies and bond energies is:\nΔHf° = [Σ (Enthalpies of atomization of elements in reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product molecule)]\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and the balanced formation reaction.**\n\nThe molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's count the number of Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n- The (CH3)2C= group has 1 central C + 2*1 C in methyl groups = 3 C atoms. It has 2*3 = 6 H atoms.\n- The =CH- group has 1 C atom and 1 H atom.\n- The -CH2- group has 1 C atom and 2 H atoms.\n- The -CH(CH3)- group has 1 chain C + 1 methyl C = 2 C atoms. It has 1 chain H + 3 methyl H = 4 H atoms.\n- The next -CH2- group has 1 C atom and 2 H atoms.\n- The -CH= group has 1 C atom and 1 H atom.\n- The =C(CH3)2 group has 1 central C + 2*1 C in methyl groups = 3 C atoms. It has 2*3 = 6 H atoms.\n\nTotal Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 atoms.\nTotal Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 atoms.\nThe molecular formula is C12H22.\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of the reactants.**\n\nThe reactants are 12 moles of solid carbon (C(s)) and 11 moles of hydrogen gas (H2(g)). We need to convert them to gaseous atoms.\n- Atomization of 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n- Atomization of 11 moles of Hydrogen: This involves breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds. 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total bond energy of the product molecule.**\n\nWe need to count the number of each type of bond in the C12H22 molecule.\nLet's analyze the structure again: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n- **C-H bonds:** The formula is C12H22, and since there are no other types of atoms, all 22 hydrogen atoms are bonded to carbon atoms. So, there are 22 C-H bonds.\n- **C=C bonds:** The structure explicitly shows two double bonds (\"=CH-\" and \"-CH=\"). So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n- **C-C bonds:** We can find the number of C-C single bonds using the total bond count. For an acyclic molecule with N_C carbons and N_H hydrogens, the total number of bonds is N_C + N_H - 1.\nTotal bonds = 12 + 22 - 1 = 33 bonds.\nNumber of C-C bonds = Total bonds - (Number of C-H bonds) - (Number of C=C bonds)\nNumber of C-C bonds = 33 - 22 - 2 = 9 C-C bonds.\n\nNow, we calculate the total bond energy of the product:\n- Energy from C-H bonds: 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n- Energy from C=C bonds: 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n- Energy from C-C bonds: 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n\nTotal bond energy of the product = 8800 + 600 + 1800 = 11200 kJ/mol.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°).**\n\nΔHf° = (Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of the product)\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n**Step 5: Check the units of the given options.**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options.\nA) 1900 kJ/g\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 11200 kJ/mol\nD) 67.4 kJ/mol\n\nOption A has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol).\nOption C is the total bond energy of the product, not the enthalpy of formation.\nOption B is in kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g.\n\nFirst, calculate the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass = 12 * (atomic mass of C) + 22 * (atomic mass of H)\nUsing approximate masses: Molar Mass ≈ 12 * 12 g/mol + 22 * 1 g/mol = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔHf° (kJ/g) = ΔHf° (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔHf° (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\nFinal check with code-based calculation:\n```python\n# Given values\nenthalpy_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_H_H = 100   # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C = 200   # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C_double = 300  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_H = 400   # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular formula C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Step 1: Calculate enthalpy of atomization of reactants: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g)\nreactants_atomization_energy = (num_C * enthalpy_atom_C) + ((num_H / 2) * bond_energy_H_H)\n# print(f\"Reactants atomization energy: {reactants_atomization_energy} kJ/mol\") # Expected: 13100\n\n# Step 2: Calculate total bond energy of the product C12H22\n# Number of bonds in C12H22 (acyclic diene)\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\nnum_C_C_double_bonds = 2\nnum_C_C_single_bonds = num_C + num_H - 1 - num_C_H_bonds - num_C_C_double_bonds # 12 + 22 - 1 - 22 - 2 = 9\nproduct_bond_energy = (num_C_H_bonds * bond_energy_C_H) + \\\n                      (num_C_C_single_bonds * bond_energy_C_C) + \\\n                      (num_C_C_double_bonds * bond_energy_C_C_double)\n# print(f\"Product total bond energy: {product_bond_energy} kJ/mol\") # Expected: 11200\n\n# Step 3: Calculate enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_of_formation_mol = reactants_atomization_energy - product_bond_energy\n# print(f\"Enthalpy of formation: {enthalpy_of_formation_mol} kJ/mol\") # Expected: 1900\n\n# Step 4: Convert to kJ/g\nmolar_mass_C = 12.0\nmolar_mass_H = 1.0\nmolar_mass_C12H22 = num_C * molar_mass_C + num_H * molar_mass_H\nenthalpy_of_formation_gram = enthalpy_of_formation_mol / molar_mass_C12H22\nprint(f\"{enthalpy_of_formation_gram:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n11.45\n>>>\nThe calculation confirms that the enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol, which is approximately 11.45 kJ/g.

    "The problem asks for the calculation of the enthalpy of formation of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. We will solve this step-by-step using the provided thermochemical data.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, let's determine the molecular formula of the compound by counting the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms from its structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   Carbons (C): There are 2 methyl groups (2 C), 1 C in the `C=`, 1 C in `=CH-`, 1 C in `-CH2-`, 1 C in `-CH()`, 1 C in the attached methyl group, 1 C in the next `-CH2-`, 1 C in `-CH=`, 1 C in `=C()`, and 2 C in the final two methyl groups.\n    Total C = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 atoms.\n*   Hydrogens (H): Following the same parts of the molecule:\n    Total H = (2 * 3) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + (2 * 3) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(solid) + 11 H2(gas) → C12H22(gas)\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThis is the energy required to break the reactants (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of hydrogen gas) into gaseous atoms.\n\n*   **Atomization of Carbon:** We are given the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. For 12 moles:\n    Energy = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **Atomization of Hydrogen:** We need to break 11 moles of H2 molecules into H atoms. This means breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    Energy = 11 mol * (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants:**\n    ΣΔH(atomization, reactants) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product Molecule**\n\nThis is the energy released when the gaseous atoms (12 C atoms and 22 H atoms) form one mole of the product molecule, C12H22. We need to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.\n\n*   **C-H bonds:** From the formula C12H22, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds (`=`). There are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** For a non-cyclic molecule, the total number of bonds is (Number of C atoms) + (Number of H atoms) - 1.\n    Total bonds = 12 + 22 - 1 = 33 bonds.\n    Number of C-C single bonds = Total bonds - (Number of C-H bonds) - (Number of C=C bonds)\n    Number of C-C bonds = 33 - 22 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nNow, we calculate the total bond energy for one mole of the product:\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n\n*   **Total Bond Energy of Product:**\n    Σ(Bond Energies) = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when forming the bonds of the product.\n\nΔHf° = [ΣΔH(atomization, reactants)] - [Σ(Bond Energies of product)]\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Convert the Units to Match the Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's check the options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 11200 kJ/mol\nD) 67.4 kJ/mol\n\nOptions A and B are in kJ/g. We need to convert our result to these units by dividing by the molar mass of C12H22.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    Molar Mass = (12 * Atomic mass of C) + (22 * Atomic mass of H)\n    Molar Mass = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\n*   **Convert ΔHf° to kJ/g:**\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.445 kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option B. The provided code output of 11.45 is a rounded version of this result.\n\n<<<B>>>"
