    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze its structure:\n*   **Benzene ring:** The core structure.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Relative positions:** The three substituents are on adjacent carbons (a 1,2,3 substitution pattern). -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other. -tBu and -NO2 are also *ortho* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence.\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** A strongly activating group, and an *ortho-, para-* director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** An activating group, and an *ortho-, para-* director. It is very bulky, which can sterically hinder substitution at its *ortho* positions.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** A strongly deactivating group, and a *meta-* director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Synthesis Strategies**\n\nThe 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern is sterically crowded and can be challenging to synthesize directly. We need to introduce the three groups in a specific order to ensure the correct regiochemistry and to achieve a high yield. Let's evaluate the options provided.\n\n**Starting Point:** All options begin with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with tert-butyl chloride.\n*   **Step i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Benzene:** This reaction produces **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a logical first step.\n\n**Continuation of the Synthesis - Evaluating the Options**\n\n**Option A:** i) tBuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; ...\n*   **Step ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene:** The -tBu group is an *o,p-*director. Due to the large size of the tert-butyl group, the major product will be **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. The desired intermediate for our target molecule would have the nitro and tert-butyl groups *ortho* to each other, so we would need **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. This ortho isomer is formed as a minor product. A sequence that relies on a minor product cannot be considered a \"high-yield\" synthesis. Therefore, option A's initial steps are inefficient.\n\n**Option D:** i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; ...\n*   **Step i) Nitration of Benzene:** -> Nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii) Reduction:** -> Aniline.\n*   **Step iii) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation of Aniline:** This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that deactivates the ring towards electrophilic attack. Thus, option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** This sequence is chemically scrambled (e.g., it lists diazotization before the formation of an amine), making it nonsensical.\n\n**Option B:** i) tBuCl/AlCl3; ii) SO3/H2SO4; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; ...\nThis option employs a **blocking group strategy**, which is a classic technique to achieve high yields of specific isomers that are difficult to obtain by direct substitution.\n*   **Step i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **Step ii) Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4):** The -tBu group directs substitution to the *para* position (which is sterically more accessible than the *ortho* positions). The major product is **p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) now \"blocks\" the para position.\n*   **Step iii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** We now nitrate p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   The -tBu group (at C1) is an *o,p-*director, directing the new group to C2 or C6.\n    *   The -SO3H group (at C4) is a *m-*director, also directing the new group to C2 or C6.\n    *   Since both groups direct to the same position, the nitration occurs cleanly at the position *ortho* to the tert-butyl group.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   This three-step sequence is a highly efficient, high-yield method to introduce a nitro group *ortho* to a tert-butyl group. The subsequent removal of the -SO3H blocking group (desulfonation) would give pure **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion on Strategy:**\nThe strategy starting with Alkylation -> Sulfonation -> Nitration (as in Option B) is vastly superior for a \"high-yield\" synthesis compared to the direct nitration in Option A.\n\n**Analyzing the Remainder of Option B**\nWhile the initial steps of Option B represent excellent chemical strategy, the order of the subsequent reagents is flawed as presented. For example, desulfonation (viii) should occur earlier, and the second nitration step (vi) is misplaced. However, compared to the other options, which are either chemically impossible (D), illogical from a yield perspective (A), or completely scrambled (C), Option B is the only one that contains the correct set of reagents and begins with a valid, high-yield synthetic sequence. It is the most plausible choice, assuming errors in the transcription of the later steps.\n\nA plausible (though still challenging) completion of the synthesis using the reagents from option B, correctly ordered, would be:\n1.  **i, ii, iii:** Form 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n2.  **viii) dilute H2SO4:** Desulfonation to get **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n3.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction to get **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n4.  **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** A problematic but necessary nitration to introduce the second nitro group at the desired position, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (This is the most difficult step to justify).\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group.\n6.  **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n7.  **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis to form the final ethoxy group.\n\nBecause Option B is the only one that starts with a correct high-yield strategy using a blocking group, it is the best answer among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
