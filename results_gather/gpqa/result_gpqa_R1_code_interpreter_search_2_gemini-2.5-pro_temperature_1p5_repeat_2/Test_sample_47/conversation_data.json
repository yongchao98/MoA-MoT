    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2), forming product 1.**\nThis is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The reaction typically occurs at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). In cyclohexanone, both alpha-positions (C2 and C6) are equivalent. The reaction yields 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming product 2.**\n2-Bromocyclohexanone is an α-halo ketone with protons on the other α-carbon (C6). When treated with a strong base like NaOH, it can undergo two possible reactions:\n1.  **Elimination:** Abstraction of a proton from C3 followed by elimination of Br- to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone (cyclohex-2-en-1-one).\n2.  **Favorskii Rearrangement:** Abstraction of a proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate, which then attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) to form a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. This strained intermediate is then attacked by hydroxide (OH-), leading to ring-opening and rearrangement. This pathway results in ring contraction.\n\nThe Favorskii rearrangement is a very common reaction for α-halo ketones with an available α'-proton. The product of this rearrangement, after workup, is a carboxylic acid with one fewer carbon in the ring. Here, the six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring.\n1.  Formation of bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one.\n2.  Attack of OH- on the carbonyl, followed by ring opening to form the more stable carbanion (on the less substituted carbon).\n3.  This forms a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylate group.\n*   **Product 2:** Sodium cyclopentanecarboxylate (the sodium salt of cyclopentanecarboxylic acid).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine, forming product 3.**\nThis is a standard reaction to convert a carboxylic acid (or its salt) into an acyl chloride. The carboxylate group of sodium cyclopentanecarboxylate is converted to a carbonyl chloride group (-COCl).\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3), forming product 4.**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Counting the chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde).**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclopentane ring bonded to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry and the different types of hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Structure:** C5H9-CHO\n*   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the C1 carbon (the one attached to the aldehyde), the aldehyde group (CHO), and bisects the rest of the ring. This plane makes C2 and C5 equivalent, and C3 and C4 equivalent.\n\nNow, let's identify the unique sets of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** There is only one of these. It is in a unique chemical environment. (1 signal)\n2.  **The proton on C1 (H-C1):** This is the only proton directly attached to the ring carbon that is also attached to the aldehyde group. It is unique. (1 signal)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, there are two protons. These two protons are diastereotopic because of their spatial relationship (cis or trans) to the aldehyde group. Therefore, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other. The 'cis' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'cis' proton on C5, and the 'trans' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'trans' proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of protons for the C2/C5 positions. (2 signals)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This results in two distinct sets of protons for the C3/C4 positions. (2 signals)\n\nTotal number of distinct hydrogen sets (signals in an NMR spectrum) = 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H's) + 2 (C3/C4-H's) = **6**.\n\nSo, there are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\nFinal check with the options:\nA) 6\nB) 8\nC) 10\nD) 7\n\nOur calculated value of 6 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
