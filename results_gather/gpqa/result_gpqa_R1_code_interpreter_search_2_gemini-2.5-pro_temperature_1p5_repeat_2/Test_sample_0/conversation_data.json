    "This problem is based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the relationship between the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt), which in this case is the lifetime (τ) of the quantum state.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Principles**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ).\n    \n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    \n*   **Lifetime and Energy Width:** For a quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ), this lifetime represents the time uncertainty (Δt = τ). This means the energy of the state is not perfectly defined but has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" (ΔE). For calculation purposes, we can approximate the minimum uncertainty as:\n    \n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n    \n*   **Resolving Energy Levels:** To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E1 - E2|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (ΔE1 + ΔE2). This is analogous to the Rayleigh criterion for resolving two light sources.\n    \n    Condition for resolution: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n    \n    Therefore, the minimum required energy difference is approximately the sum of the widths of the two energy levels.\n\n**2. Calculations**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state using the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nNow, let's calculate the minimum energy difference required to resolve these two levels by summing their uncertainties.\n\n*   **Minimum Energy Difference:**\n    *   |E1 - E2|ₘᵢₙ ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   |E1 - E2|ₘᵢₙ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   |E1 - E2|ₘᵢₙ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   |E1 - E2|ₘᵢₙ ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nTo perform the calculation precisely, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# The reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state\n# based on the uncertainty principle: Delta_E * tau >= h_bar\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must be greater\n# than the sum of their individual widths. We calculate this minimum sum.\nmin_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"The minimum energy difference required to resolve the states is approximately: {min_energy_difference:.3e} eV\")\n```\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation shows that the minimum energy difference required to resolve the two states is approximately **7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV**.\n\nWe need to choose an option that is clearly *greater* than this value. Let's compare this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV   (smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV   (much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV   (much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two energy levels, as it is significantly greater than the sum of their natural line widths.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem is based on the energy-time uncertainty principle, which sets a fundamental limit on how precisely we can know a particle's energy for a given lifetime.\n\n### Reasoning and Principles\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle relates the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt). A common form is ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n2.  **Lifetime and Energy Width:** For an unstable quantum state, its lifetime (τ) can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt = τ). This implies that the energy level is not perfectly sharp but has an intrinsic \"energy width\" or uncertainty, ΔE. For calculation purposes, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. This ΔE represents the minimum possible spread in the energy of that state.\n3.  **Resolving Two Energy Levels:** To be able to clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two separate energy levels, the difference in their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂). If the energy difference is smaller than this sum, the energy distributions of the two states will overlap too much to be seen as distinct.\n    *   **Condition for resolution:** |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n### Calculation\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy width (uncertainty) for each state.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nNext, we find the minimum energy difference required for resolution by summing the two energy widths.\n\n*   **Minimum Energy Difference for Resolution:**\n    *   |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   |E₁ - E₂| > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   |E₁ - E₂| > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   |E₁ - E₂| > 7.238 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nThe executed code confirms this result: `The minimum energy difference required to resolve the states is approximately: 7.240e-07 eV`.\n\n### Comparing with Options\n\nWe must choose an energy difference from the options that is greater than this minimum required value of ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (<< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV) - Not resolvable.\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV (< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV) - Not resolvable.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 x 10⁻⁷ eV (<< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV) - Not resolvable.\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV  (>> 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV) - **Clearly resolvable.**\n\nTherefore, an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<D>>>"
