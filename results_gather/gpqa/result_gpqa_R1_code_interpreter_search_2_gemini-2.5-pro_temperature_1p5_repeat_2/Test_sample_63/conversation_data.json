    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts A and B was heated, and the resulting gas mixture was passed through three tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g. This corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂).\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase (0.80 g) is due to the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ is 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Final Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remained. The conditions are standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, Ca(OH)₂, or hot copper. This suggests it is a relatively inert gas. A very common product from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The fact that its weight did not change strongly implies that no such acidic gases were produced in the decomposition.\n\n**2. Verify the Identities and Quantities of Gases with Mass Conservation**\n\nLet's check if our identified gases (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) account for the total initial mass of the salts.\n*   Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n*   Mass of O₂ produced = 0.80 g.\n*   Mass of N₂ produced (assuming Gas C is N₂) = moles × molar mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass of gaseous products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThe total mass of the products equals the initial mass of the reactants. This confirms that the only gases produced were H₂O, O₂, and N₂, and our calculated mole quantities are correct.\n\n**3. Determine the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nWe know the following about the salts A and B:\n*   They are in an equimolar mixture (moles of A = moles of B).\n*   They weigh 7.20 g in total.\n*   They decompose completely into gaseous products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) upon heating. This suggests they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions.\n\nLet's propose candidate salts and test if they fit the data. The most common salts fitting this description are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n    *   Decomposition: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   This reaction produces N₂ and H₂O.\n\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n    *   Ammonium nitrate has a complex decomposition that depends on temperature. A common reaction at moderate temperatures is NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O. This does not produce the O₂ we observed.\n    *   However, at slightly higher temperatures or under certain conditions, a different decomposition occurs: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n    *   This reaction produces all three of our observed gases: N₂, O₂, and H₂O.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that salts A and B are NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\nLet 'n' be the moles of each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01*2 + 1.01*4 + 16.00*3 = 80.05 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01*2 + 1.01*4 + 16.00*2 = 64.05 g/mol\n*   Total mass = n × (M_A + M_B) = n × (80.05 + 64.05) = n × 144.1 g/mol.\n*   We know the total mass is 7.20 g: n × 144.1 = 7.20 g => n ≈ 0.05 mol.\n\nNow, let's see if 0.05 moles of each salt produce the correct amount of gases based on our hypothesized reactions.\n*   **From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂:**\n    *   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   Products: 0.05 mol N₂ and 2 × 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n\n*   **From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃:**\n    *   Using the reaction: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n    *   The stoichiometric ratio is 2 moles of NH₄NO₃ produce 2 moles N₂, 1 mole O₂, and 4 moles H₂O.\n    *   Since we have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃, which is (0.05/2) = 0.025 of the reaction unit:\n    *   Moles of N₂ produced = (0.05/2) × 2 = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ produced = (0.05/2) × 1 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O produced = (0.05/2) × 4 = 0.10 mol.\n\n**4. Sum the Products and Compare with Experimental Data**\nLet's sum the products from the decomposition of both salts:\n*   **Total Moles of N₂:** 0.05 mol (from NH₄NO₂) + 0.05 mol (from NH₄NO₃) = **0.10 mol**. (Matches Gas C)\n*   **Total Moles of O₂:** 0 mol (from NH₄NO₂) + 0.025 mol (from NH₄NO₃) = **0.025 mol**. (Matches Tube №3)\n*   **Total Moles of H₂O:** 0.10 mol (from NH₄NO₂) + 0.10 mol (from NH₄NO₃) = **0.20 mol**. (Matches Tube №1)\n\nThe calculated products perfectly match the experimental results. Therefore, our assumption is correct: Salt A is ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and Salt B is ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1 Nitrogen (in NH₄⁺) + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen (in NO₃⁻) + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1 Nitrogen (in NH₄⁺) + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen (in NO₂⁻) + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nFinal check of the steps using a script for calculations.\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_H2O = 18.015\nM_O2 = 31.998\nM_N2 = 28.014\nM_NH4NO3 = 80.043\nM_NH4NO2 = 64.043\n\n# Step 1: Moles of products from experimental data\nmass_H2O = 3.60\nmass_O2 = 0.80\nvol_gas_C_STP = 2.24\n\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\nmoles_O2 = mass_O2 / M_O2\nmoles_gas_C = vol_gas_C_STP / 22.4\n\nprint(f\"Moles H2O: {moles_H2O:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Moles O2: {moles_O2:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Moles Gas C: {moles_gas_C:.4f}\")\n\n# Step 2: Mass balance check\ntotal_mass_products = mass_H2O + mass_O2 + (moles_gas_C * M_N2)\nprint(f\"Total mass of products: {total_mass_products:.2f} g\")\n\n# Step 3: Moles of equimolar salts\ntotal_mass_salts = 7.20\nmoles_each_salt = total_mass_salts / (M_NH4NO3 + M_NH4NO2)\nprint(f\"Moles of each salt: {moles_each_salt:.4f}\")\n\n# Step 4: Verify products from 0.05 moles of each salt\nn = 0.05\n# NH4NO2 -> N2 + 2H2O\nprod_N2_from_NH4NO2 = n\nprod_H2O_from_NH4NO2 = 2 * n\n\n# 2NH4NO3 -> 2N2 + O2 + 4H2O\nprod_N2_from_NH4NO3 = n\nprod_O2_from_NH4NO3 = n / 2\nprod_H2O_from_NH4NO3 = 2 * n\n\n# Total products\ntotal_N2 = prod_N2_from_NH4NO2 + prod_N2_from_NH4NO3\ntotal_O2 = prod_O2_from_NH4NO3\ntotal_H2O = prod_H2O_from_NH4NO2 + prod_H2O_from_NH4NO3\n\nprint(f\"Calculated total moles N2: {total_N2:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated total moles O2: {total_O2:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated total moles H2O: {total_H2O:.4f}\")\n\n\n# Step 5: Count atoms\n# NH4NO3: 2 N, 4 H, 3 O\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 3\n# NH4NO2: 2 N, 4 H, 2 O\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 2\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(f\"Total atoms in A and B: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**1. Analysis of Gaseous Products**\n\nThe experiment involves heating a mixture of salts and analyzing the gaseous products. Let's identify each gas and its quantity.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a desiccant (drying agent) that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution tests for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The weight did not change, so no such gases were formed.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through the tubes, 2.24 L of a gas remained under standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, an acid gas test, or hot copper, indicating it is a relatively unreactive gas. The most likely product from heating nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Mass Conservation Check**\n\nLet's verify our findings by checking if the mass of the products equals the initial mass of the salts.\n*   Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂) = moles × molar mass = 0.10 mol × 28 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThe masses match, confirming that the decomposition products are indeed 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are composed of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. This suggests that salts A and B are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. We need to find two salts whose thermal decomposition in an equimolar mixture yields the exact quantities of gases we calculated.\n\nLet's test common ammonium salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂): The decomposition reaction is **NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**.\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃): The decomposition can vary. A relevant reaction is **2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)**. This reaction produces all three of our observed gases.\n\nLet's assume salts A and B are NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂, and they are present in an equimolar amount, 'n' moles of each.\n\n*   From the decomposition of `n` mol of NH₄NO₂: `n` mol of N₂ and `2n` mol of H₂O are produced.\n*   From the decomposition of `n` mol of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio): `n` mol of N₂, `n/2` mol of O₂, and `2n` mol of H₂O are produced.\n\nNow, let's sum the products from both reactions:\n*   Total moles of N₂ = `n` (from NH₄NO₂) + `n` (from NH₄NO₃) = `2n`.\n*   Total moles of O₂ = `0` + `n/2` (from NH₄NO₃) = `n/2`.\n*   Total moles of H₂O = `2n` (from NH₄NO₂) + `2n` (from NH₄NO₃) = `4n`.\n\nWe equate these to our experimental results:\n*   For N₂: `2n` = 0.10 mol  =>  `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   For O₂: `n/2` = 0.025 mol =>  `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   For H₂O: `4n` = 0.20 mol  =>  `n` = 0.05 mol.\n\nAll calculations consistently give `n` = 0.05 mol. This strongly supports our hypothesis. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n**4. Final Calculation: Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in their respective formulas:\nTotal atoms = 9 (in A) + 8 (in B) = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
