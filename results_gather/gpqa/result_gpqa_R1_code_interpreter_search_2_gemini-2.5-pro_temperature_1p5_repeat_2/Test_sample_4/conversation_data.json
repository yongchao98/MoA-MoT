    "This problem asks for the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator representing the spin of a muon along a specific direction. The eigenvector corresponds to a specific eigenvalue. Let's break down the problem into clear steps.\n\n**1. Identify the operators**\n\nThe problem provides the Cartesian components of the operator $\\vec{P}$:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThese are the spin angular momentum operators for a spin-1/2 particle (like a muon), often denoted as $\\vec{S}$. The matrices are the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$), such that $\\vec{P} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\n**2. Define the direction vector**\n\nThe direction $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary direction lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector in the x-z plane can be parameterized by a single angle $\\theta$ with respect to the z-axis. In Cartesian coordinates, this vector is:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\nHere, $n_x = \\sin\\theta$, $n_y = 0$, and $n_z = \\cos\\theta$.\n\n**3. Construct the operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$, denoted as $P_n$, is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\nSubstituting the components:\n$P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x) (\\sin\\theta) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y) (0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z) (\\cos\\theta)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, let's write this in matrix form:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Set up and solve the eigenvalue equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that satisfies the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation yields a system of two linear equations:\n1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve for the relationship between $a$ and $b$ using the first equation:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nNow, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n$1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n$\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, we have $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. We can write this as $a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. To avoid fractions, we can also write it as $C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some constant $C$.\n\n**5. Normalize the eigenvector**\n\nThe eigenvector must be normalized, meaning its norm (length) must be 1. For a vector $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$, the squared norm is $|x|^2 + |y|^2$. Let our eigenvector be $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$:\n$|C|^2 (|\\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |\\sin(\\theta/2)|^2) = 1$\n$|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\nUsing the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$:\n$|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$\n\nWe can choose the simplest phase for C, which is $C=1$.\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**6. Compare with the given options**\n\n*   A) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$\n*   B) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$\n*   C) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$\n*   D) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$\n\nOur calculated result $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
