    "This problem involves the two-body decay of a stationary particle. We need to apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. Understand the Decay Process**\n\nThe decay is given by:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + νμ\n\n*   **π⁺ (positive pion):** The parent particle, which is stationary.\n*   **μ⁺ (positive muon):** One of the daughter particles, with rest mass.\n*   **νμ (muon neutrino):** The other daughter particle. We can assume its rest mass is negligible (m_ν ≈ 0).\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n\n*   Rest mass energy of the pion (m_πc²): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of the muon (m_μc²): 105.7 MeV\n*   The initial pion (π⁺) is stationary.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after.\n    *   Initial Energy (E_initial): Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n        E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n    *   Final Energy (E_final): The total energy of the two product particles.\n        E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n        where E_μ is the total energy of the muon and E_ν is the total energy of the neutrino.\n    *   Equating them:\n        m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before must equal the total momentum after.\n    *   Initial Momentum (**p**_initial): Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero.\n        **p**_initial = 0\n    *   Final Momentum (**p**_final): The vector sum of the momenta of the product particles.\n        **p**_final = **p**_μ + **p**_ν\n    *   Equating them:\n        **p**_μ + **p**_ν = 0\n        This implies that the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum: |**p**_μ| = |**p**_ν| = p.\n\n**4. Relate Energy, Momentum, and Mass**\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n\n*   **For the neutrino (νμ):** Since its rest mass is approximately zero (m_ν ≈ 0), its energy-momentum relation is E_ν² = (p_νc)².\n    This simplifies to E_ν = p_νc = pc. As the rest mass is zero, its total energy is purely kinetic energy (KE_ν = E_ν).\n    So, KE_ν = pc.\n\n*   **For the muon (μ⁺):**\n    E_μ² = (p_μc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    Since p_μ = p, we can substitute p = E_ν/c:\n    E_μ² = (E_ν/c * c)² + (m_μc²)²\n    E_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n\n**5. Solve for the Energies**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  m_πc² = E R_μ + E_ν  =>  E_ν = m_πc² - E_μ\n2.  E_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\nE_μ² = (m_πc² - E_μ)² + (m_μc²)²\nE_μ² = (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_μ + E_μ² + (m_μc²)²\n\nThe E_μ² terms cancel out. Rearranging the equation to solve for E_μ:\n2(m_πc²)E_μ = (m_πc²)² + (m_μc²)²\nE_μ = [(m_πc²)² + (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\nLet's use a Python script for precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\nE_mu = (m_pi_c2**2 + m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# The total energy released (Q-value) is distributed as kinetic energy\nQ_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n# Q_value = KE_mu + KE_nu\nKE_nu = Q_value - KE_mu\n\n# The products are the muon (mu) and the neutrino (nu)\nprint(f\"KE of muon: {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino: {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nKE of muon: 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino: 29.78 MeV\n```\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (νμ). This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem describes the two-body decay of a stationary particle. To solve it, we must apply the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in the framework of special relativity.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   Particle: Positive Pion (π⁺)\n*   State: Stationary (at rest)\n*   Total Initial Energy (E_i): Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy, E_i = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV.\n*   Total Initial Momentum (p_i): Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero, p_i = 0.\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   Particles: Positive Muon (μ⁺) and a Muon Neutrino (ν_μ)\n*   We need to find the kinetic energies of these two particles (KE_μ and KE_ν).\n\n**3. Applying Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    The total momentum after the decay must equal the total momentum before.\n    p_f = p_μ + p_ν = p_i = 0\n    This implies that the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n    |**p**_μ| = |**p**_ν| = p\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy after the decay must equal the total energy before.\n    E_f = E_μ + E_ν = E_i = m_πc²\n    Where E_μ and E_ν are the total energies of the muon and neutrino, respectively.\n    \n    The total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n    *   For the muon (μ⁺): E_μ = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )\n    *   For the neutrino (ν_μ): Neutrinos have negligible rest mass, so we can assume m_ν = 0. Therefore, its energy is E_ν = pc.\n\n**4. Solving the Equations:**\n\nWe have a system of equations:\n1.  m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n2.  E_ν = pc\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\nm_πc² = E_μ + pc  =>  pc = m_πc² - E_μ\n\nNow, use the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\nE_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nSubstitute the expression for `pc` into this equation:\nE_μ² = (m_πc² - E_μ)² + (m_μc²)²\nE_μ² = (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_μ + E_μ² + (m_μc²)²\n\nThe E_μ² term cancels on both sides. We can now solve for the total energy of the muon, E_μ:\n0 = (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_μ + (m_μc²)²\n2(m_πc²)E_μ = (m_πc²)² + (m_μc²)²\nE_μ = [ (m_πc²)² + (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2(m_πc²) ]\n\n**5. Calculation:**\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n*   m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n*   m_μc² = 105.7 MeV\n\nE_μ = [ (139.6)² + (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\nE_μ = [ 19488.16 + 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\nE_μ = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.82 MeV\n\nThis is the **total energy** of the muon. The kinetic energy (KE_μ) is the total energy minus the rest mass energy:\nKE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\nKE_μ = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.12 MeV\n\nNow, let's find the energy of the neutrino (E_ν). From the conservation of energy:\nE_ν = m_πc² - E_μ\nE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 109.82 MeV = 29.78 MeV\n\nSince the neutrino is considered massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy:\nKE_ν = E_ν = 29.78 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV (for the muon) and 29.8 MeV (for the neutrino).\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
