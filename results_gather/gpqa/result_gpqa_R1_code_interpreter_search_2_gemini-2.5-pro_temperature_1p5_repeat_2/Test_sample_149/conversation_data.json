    "**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO) from 1H-NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5. A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (DoU=4) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O) or ring.\n\n*   **1H-NMR Signal Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates that the adjacent carbon has two protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates it's adjacent to a carbon with one proton (1+1=2). This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as the CH2 protons are coupled to the single CHO proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets and each integrates to two protons. This pattern is classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring, where the two substituents are electronically different, causing the chemically equivalent protons on each side to split each other.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This is characteristic of an exchangeable proton group, most likely a primary amine (-NH2). The nitrogen atom in the molecular formula supports this.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring with two substituents at the para (1,4) positions.\n    *   One substituent is an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is a 2-oxoethyl group (-CH2-CHO).\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. This matches perfectly.\n    *   The starting material is **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O**\n    1.  **Diazotization:** The reagents NaNO2 and HCl at low temperature convert a primary aromatic amine (like the one in our starting material) into a diazonium salt. The -NH2 group is converted to -N2+Cl-.\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** Adding water (H2O) to the diazonium salt solution and warming it causes the -N2+ group to be replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N2). This is a standard synthesis of phenols from anilines.\n    *   **Intermediate Product:** The overall result of these two steps is the conversion of the amino group to a hydroxyl group. The molecule becomes **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat, acting on an aldehyde that has α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for a self-**Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde to form an enolate ion.\n        b.  **Aldol Addition:** This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, also known as an aldol addition product. The structure of this intermediate is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (which corresponds to option B).\n        c.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The \"Heat\" specified in the reaction conditions provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The -OH group from the β-carbon (C3) and the acidic proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This step is highly favorable because it creates an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new C=C double bond is conjugated with the C=O bond of the aldehyde, creating a very stable, extended conjugated system.\n    *   **Final Product:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal results in the formation of **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nLet's check the name and structure of the final product:\nChain: C4H2(Ph-OH) - C3H = C2(Ph-OH) - C1HO\nThis corresponds to a but-2-enal skeleton with 4-hydroxyphenyl groups attached to carbon 2 and carbon 4. The name is indeed 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence of reactions transforms 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde into 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. The explicit inclusion of \"Heat\" indicates that the reaction proceeds to the final, stable, dehydrated product, which is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n*   Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde\n*   After Steps 1 & 2: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde\n*   Step 3 (Aldol Addition Intermediate): 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option B)\n*   Step 3 (Final Condensation Product): **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (Option A)\n\nThe question asks for the final product, which is the result after all reactions, including the heat-driven dehydration, are complete.\n\n<<<A>>>"
