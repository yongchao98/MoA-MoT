As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Phenotypes of Single Mutants\n\nFirst, let's understand the role of each gene individually by looking at the single knock-out mutants. The resistance level is compared to a wild-type (WT) control, which has 100% resistance.\n\n*   **g1 (G1 knock-out):** 75% resistance. This means loss of G1 function causes a partial loss of resistance (25% reduction). So, G1 contributes to resistance.\n*   **g2 (G2 knock-out):** 0% resistance. This means loss of G2 function causes a complete loss of resistance. This is a very strong phenotype, suggesting G2 plays an essential, non-redundant role in the resistance pathway.\n*   **g3 (G3 knock-out):** 50% resistance. Loss of G3 function causes a significant loss of resistance (50% reduction). G3 also contributes substantially to resistance, seemingly more than G1.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Phenotypes of Double Mutants and Determine Epistasis\n\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another gene. We can detect this by comparing the phenotype of a double mutant to the phenotypes of the corresponding single mutants.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance) and not the `g1` single mutant (75% resistance). When a double mutant's phenotype matches one of the single mutants, the gene from that single mutant is considered **epistatic** to the other. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G1 in the same pathway. If the upstream gene (G2) is knocked out, the pathway is broken, so knocking out a downstream gene (G1) has no additional effect.\n\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance. Similarly, this phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance) and not the `g3` single mutant (50% resistance). Therefore, **G2 is also epistatic to G3**. This reinforces the idea that G2 is an upstream regulator of G3 as well.\n\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance. This phenotype is *different* from both the `g1` single mutant (75%) and the `g3` single mutant (50%). In fact, it's more severe than either. This indicates that G1 and G3 do not have a simple epistatic relationship. Instead, their functions are at least partially additive or synergistic. They likely act in parallel pathways or have overlapping functions.\n\n### 3. Synthesize the Pathway and Evaluate the Options\n\nBased on the analysis, we can propose a genetic pathway:\n\n1.  **G2 is an upstream master regulator.** Its complete epistatic effect over both G1 and G3, combined with the fact that its knockout abolishes all resistance, strongly supports the hypothesis given in the problem statement: that one gene is a **transcription factor** acting upstream. G2 is the only candidate for this role.\n\n2.  **G1 and G3 are downstream of G2 and have redundant functions.** They are both controlled by G2 and contribute to resistance in parallel. The loss of either one reduces resistance, but the loss of both almost completely wipes it out (10% vs 75% or 50%). This relationship is best described as **partial gene redundancy**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options against our conclusions:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: We only have data on one trait (resistance), so we cannot conclude anything about pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits).\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. The data strongly suggests G2 is the transcription factor, not G1. If G1 were an upstream TF for G2, the `g1` mutant phenotype would be at least as severe as the `g2` mutant phenotype, which is not the case (75% vs 0%).\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct. This aligns perfectly with our analysis.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct. This is the best description for their relationship, where the double mutant phenotype is much more severe than either single mutant.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This part of the statement is factually incorrect based on the data. However, compared to the other options, this option contains two strongly supported, correct conclusions. The final clause is likely an error in the question's construction.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption D provides the most accurate description of the genetic interactions. It correctly identifies G2 as the upstream transcription factor and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as one of gene redundancy. Despite the erroneous final clause, it is the best possible answer among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
