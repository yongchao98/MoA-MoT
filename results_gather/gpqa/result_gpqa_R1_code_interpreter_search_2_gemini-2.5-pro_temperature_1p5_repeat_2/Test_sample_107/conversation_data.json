    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the two quantities to be compared:**\n    *   The paramagnetic coupling term, which we'll denote as `⟨H⟩`. This is the energy shift due to the Zeeman effect.\n    *   The transition energy `ΔE` for a Hydrogen atom, corresponding to the given wavelength `λ`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the transition energy `ΔE`:**\n    *   The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the formula:\n        $E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n    *   Where:\n        *   `h` is Planck's constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}$)\n        *   `c` is the speed of light ($3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$)\n        *   `λ` is the wavelength given as $0.4861 \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        $\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the paramagnetic coupling term `⟨H⟩`:**\n    *   The energy of the paramagnetic coupling (Zeeman effect) is given by the interaction of the orbital magnetic moment with the external magnetic field.\n    *   The formula for this energy is:\n        $\\langle H \\rangle = m \\cdot \\mu_B \\cdot B$\n    *   Where:\n        *   `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem states to use a \"small\" value, so we can use `m=1` to find the order of magnitude of the splitting.\n        *   `μ_B` is the Bohr magneton ($9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$).\n        *   `B` is the magnetic field strength, given as `1 T`.\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        $\\langle H \\rangle = 1 \\times (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n\n4.  **Compare the two energies:**\n    *   We have $\\Delta E \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$.\n    *   We have $\\langle H \\rangle = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$.\n    *   To compare them, let's look at their ratio:\n        $\\frac{\\Delta E}{\\langle H \\rangle} = \\frac{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}}{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}} \\approx 4.4 \\times 10^4$\n    *   This shows that `ΔE` is more than 40,000 times larger than `⟨H⟩`.\n    *   Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling energy is much, much smaller than the transition energy. This relationship is expressed as $\\langle H \\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\nThe following python code confirms the calculation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J·s\nc = 299792458       # Speed of light in m/s\nmu_B = 9.2740100783e-24 # Bohr magneton in J/T\n\n# Given values\nwavelength_lambda = 0.4861e-6 # Wavelength in meters\nB = 1.0                     # Magnetic field in Tesla\nm = 1                       # Small orbital magnetic quantum number\n\n# 1. Calculate the transition energy Delta_E\nDelta_E = (h * c) / wavelength_lambda\n\n# 2. Calculate the paramagnetic coupling term H_coupling\nH_coupling = m * mu_B * B\n\n# 3. Compare the two values\nprint(f\"Transition Energy (Delta_E): {Delta_E:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic Coupling Energy (<H>): {H_coupling:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Ratio (Delta_E / <H>): {Delta_E / H_coupling:.4e}\")\n\n# Conclusion based on comparison\nif H_coupling < Delta_E / 100: # Check if H is significantly smaller\n    print(\"Conclusion: <H> << Delta_E\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Comparison is not strongly one-sided\")\n\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The paramagnetic coupling term, also known as the Zeeman effect energy, is given by the formula:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle =m\\mu _{B}B$\nwhere:\n*   $m$ is the magnetic quantum number. The problem specifies a \"small\" value, so we can use $m=1$ for our order-of-magnitude calculation.\n*   $\\mu _{B}$ is the Bohr magneton, a physical constant with a value of approximately $9.274\\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$.\n*   $B$ is the external magnetic field strength, given as $1\\text{ T}$.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get the energy of the paramagnetic coupling:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle =1 \\cdot (9.274\\times 10^{-24}\\text{ J/T}) \\cdot 1\\text{ T} = 9.274\\times 10^{-24}\\text{ J}$\n\nNext, we calculate the transition energy $\\Delta E$ corresponding to the given wavelength $\\lambda = 0.4861\\mu \\text{m}$. The relationship between energy and wavelength is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\nwhere:\n*   $h$ is Planck's constant, approximately $6.626\\times 10^{-34}\\text{ J·s}$.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light, approximately $3.00\\times 10^{8}\\text{ m/s}$.\n*   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, given as $0.4861\\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861\\times 10^{-6}\\text{ m}$.\n\nPlugging in these values:\n$\\Delta E=\\frac{(6.626\\times 10^{-34}\\text{ J·s})(3.00\\times 10^{8}\\text{ m/s})}{0.4861\\times 10^{-6}\\text{ m}} \\approx 4.089\\times 10^{-19}\\text{ J}$\n\nNow, we compare the two energy values:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 9.27\\times 10^{-24}\\text{ J}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 4.09\\times 10^{-19}\\text{ J}$\n\nThe transition energy is of the order of $10^{-19}\\text{ J}$, while the paramagnetic coupling energy is of the order of $10^{-24}\\text{ J}$. Since the exponent -24 is significantly smaller than -19, the paramagnetic coupling energy is much smaller than the atomic transition energy.\nThe ratio is $\\frac{\\Delta E}{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle} = \\frac{4.09\\times 10^{-19}}{9.27\\times 10^{-24}} \\approx 4.4 \\times 10^4$.\nThis confirms that $\\Delta E$ is over 40,000 times larger than $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$.\nTherefore, the relationship is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
