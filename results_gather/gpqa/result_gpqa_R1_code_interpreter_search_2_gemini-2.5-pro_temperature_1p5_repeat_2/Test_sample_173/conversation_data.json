    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand and Define the initial parameters:**\n\n*   Initial nucleus at rest, with mass M.\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: $M c^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. Let $m_1$ be the more massive fragment.\n*   The mass relationship is given as \"one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other\". This can be ambiguous. We will assume it means $m_1 = 2m_2$. We can check the validity of this assumption later against the given options.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest masses and energy released (Q-value):**\n\nFirst, let's determine the masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ in terms of M.\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M$.\nThen, $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2 \\times 0.33 M = 0.66 M$.\n\nNow, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   $m_1 c^2 = 0.66 \\times (M c^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   $m_2 c^2 = 0.33 \\times (M c^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is the decrease in rest-mass energy. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the two fragments.\n$Q = (\\text{Initial rest energy}) - (\\text{Final rest energy})$\n$Q = M c^2 - (m_1 c^2 + m_2 c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\nSo, the total kinetic energy of the fragments is $T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the kinetic energy of the massive fragment using Classical Mechanics ($T_{1, classical}$):**\n\nIn classical mechanics, conservation of momentum implies that if the initial nucleus is at rest, the two fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of momentum be $p$.\n$p_1 = p_2 = p$.\nThe kinetic energy is given by $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\n*   $T_{1, cl} = p^2 / (2m_1)$\n*   $T_{2, cl} = p^2 / (2m_2)$\n\nFrom these equations, we can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n$\\frac{T_{1, cl}}{T_{2, cl}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33 M}{0.66 M} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSo, $T_{2, cl} = 2 T_{1, cl}$.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n$T_{1, cl} + T_{2, cl} = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1, cl} + 2 T_{1, cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3 T_{1, cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1, cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the kinetic energy of the massive fragment using Relativistic Mechanics ($T_1$):**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the initial nucleus at rest also implies the final total momentum is zero, so the fragments have momenta of equal magnitude, $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy E, momentum p, and rest mass m is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The kinetic energy is $T = E - mc^2$.\nFrom this, we can derive the relationship between kinetic energy and momentum: $(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2 = T(T + 2mc^2)$.\n\nSince the momenta are equal, $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n$T_1(T_1 + 2m_1c^2) = T_2(T_2 + 2m_2c^2)$.\n\nWe also have the total kinetic energy constraint $T_2 = Q - T_1$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$T_1(T_1 + 2m_1c^2) = (Q - T_1)(Q - T_1 + 2m_2c^2)$.\n\nNow, we plug in the known energy values ($Q = 3$ GeV, $m_1c^2 = 198$ GeV, $m_2c^2 = 99$ GeV):\n$T_1(T_1 + 2 \\times 198) = (3 - T_1)(3 - T_1 + 2 \\times 99)$\n$T_1(T_1 + 396) = (3 - T_1)(3 - T_1 + 198)$\n$T_1(T_1 + 396) = (3 - T_1)(201 - T_1)$\n$T_1^2 + 396 T_1 = 603 - 201 T_1 - 3 T_1 + T_1^2$\n$T_1^2 + 396 T_1 = 603 - 204 T_1 + T_1^2$\n$396 T_1 + 204 T_1 = 603$\n$600 T_1 = 603$\n$T_1 = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is $T_1 = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5. Find the difference:**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) $T_1$ value and the classical approximation.\nDifference = $T_1 - T_{1, classical}$\nDifference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThis value matches one of the options, which supports our initial interpretation of the mass ratio.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5 \\text{ MeV}}$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
