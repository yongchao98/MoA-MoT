    "The user wants to find the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance and the distance `r`, given the relationship between the number of stars and parallax `plx`.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    The number of stars, let's call it N, is a function of parallax, `plx`.\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies as `1/plx^5`.\n    So, `N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`. This can be written as `N(plx) = k / plx^5`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n    This `N` represents the cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than or equal to `plx`. Since parallax is smaller for more distant stars, this is equivalent to the total number of stars up to a certain distance `r`.\n\n2.  **Relate parallax to distance:**\n    Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely related. The standard formula is `plx = 1/r`, where `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n    Therefore, `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars as a function of distance:**\n    We can substitute the relationship `plx ∝ 1/r` into the given formula for `N`.\n    `N(r) ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N(r) ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    `N(r) ∝ r^5`\n    This means the *total* (or cumulative) number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of distance:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* changes with `r`. This is not the total number `N(r)`, but the rate of change of `N` with respect to `r`. Mathematically, this is the derivative `dN/dr`. This quantity represents the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance `r` with thickness `dr`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative:**\n    Since `N(r) = C * r^5` for some constant `C`, we can differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r^5)`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation, `d/dx (x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`:\n    `dN/dr = C * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = 5C * r^4`\n\n6.  **Determine the proportionality:**\n    Since `5C` is just another constant, we can see the proportionality:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r^4`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
