    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let's first draw its structure.\n    *   \"nona\" indicates a 9-carbon parent chain.\n    *   \"-2,6-diene\" indicates double bonds between carbons 2 and 3, and between carbons 6 and 7.\n    *   \"5-butyl\" indicates a butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n    *   The structure is:\n        CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH(C₄H₉)-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃\n         1   2   3   4        5        6   7   8   9\n\n*   **Reaction Condition:** The molecule is heated. Heating a molecule that contains a 1,5-diene system is a classic condition for a **Cope rearrangement**.\n\n**2. Identify the 1,5-Diene System and the Cope Rearrangement**\n\n*   A 1,5-diene has a structure of C=C-C-C-C=C. In our molecule, the double bonds are at C2=C3 and C6=C7. They are connected by carbons C4 and C5. So, the sequence C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7 forms a 1,5-diene system.\n*   The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. In this concerted pericyclic reaction, a sigma bond breaks, a new sigma bond forms, and two pi bonds shift their positions.\n*   For our system, C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7:\n    *   The sigma bond between C4 and C5 will break.\n    *   A new sigma bond will form between C2 and C7.\n    *   The pi bond at C2=C3 will move to C3=C4.\n    *   The pi bond at C6=C7 will move to C5=C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nLet's trace the connectivity of the atoms in the product molecule.\n\n*   **Original atoms and groups involved in the rearrangement:**\n    *   On C2: a methyl group (C1) and a hydrogen.\n    *   On C3: a hydrogen.\n    *   On C4: two hydrogens.\n    *   On C5: a butyl group and a hydrogen.\n    *   On C6: a hydrogen.\n    *   On C7: an ethyl group (C8-C9) and a hydrogen.\n\n*   **New connectivity in the product:**\n    *   A new C2-C7 single bond is formed.\n    *   A new C3=C4 double bond is formed. Based on the hydrogens on the original C3 (one H) and C4 (two H's), this fragment becomes -CH=CH₂.\n    *   A new C5=C6 double bond is formed. Based on the original C5 (one H, one butyl) and C6 (one H), this fragment becomes -(C₄H₉)C=CH-.\n    *   The resulting structure's skeleton connects these pieces. The central feature is the new C2-C7 bond. All the original substituents remain attached to their respective carbons.\n\n*   **Assembling the product structure:**\n    *   The methyl group (originally C1) is attached to C2.\n    *   The ethyl group (originally C8-C9) is attached to C7.\n    *   The butyl group is attached to C5.\n    *   The resulting connectivity can be drawn as:\n        CH₃-CH(C2) - CH(C3)=CH₂(C4)\n              |\n        (CH₃CH₂)CH(C7) - CH(C6)=C(C5)-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃\n\n**4. Name the Product Using IUPAC Nomenclature**\n\nTo name the product, we must find the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups (the two double bonds).\n\n1.  **Find the parent chain:** The chain must contain both the C3=C4 and C5=C6 double bonds. The atoms C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7 are all involved. To create the longest possible chain, we should extend from the ends of this core structure. The possible extensions are the butyl group on C5, the ethyl group on C7, and the methyl group on C2.\n    The longest chain starts from the end of the butyl group, goes through C5, C6, C7, C2, and ends at C4.\n    Chain path: (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₂)-C₅=C₆-C₇-C₂-C₃=C₄\n    The length of this chain is 4 (from butyl) + 1(C5) + 1(C6) + 1(C7) + 1(C2) + 1(C3) + 1(C4) = 10 carbons.\n    So, the parent alkane is **decane**. Since it has two double bonds, it's a **decadiene**.\n\n2.  **Number the parent chain:** We number the chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants (positions).\n    *   Numbering from the butyl-group end: The double bonds would be at positions 5 (C₅=C₆) and 9 (C₃=C₄). Locants: (5,9).\n    *   Numbering from the C4 end: The double bonds would be at positions 1 (C₄=C₃) and 5 (C₆=C₅). Locants: (1,5).\n    Since (1,5) is lower than (5,9), we number the chain starting from C4 as carbon #1.\n    The parent chain name is **deca-1,5-diene**.\n\n3.  **Identify and locate substituents:**\n    *   There is a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the original C2. In our new numbering, the original C2 is carbon #3. So, we have a **3-methyl** group.\n    *   There is an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) attached to the original C7. In our new numbering, the original C7 is carbon #4. So, we have a **4-ethyl** group.\n\n4.  **Assemble the full name:** We list the substituents alphabetically before the parent chain name.\n    The full IUPAC name is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n*   B) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n*   C) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n*   D) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n\nOur derived name, 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene, matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
