    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution.**\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH):\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.05 M\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.0200 L = 0.00100 mol\n*   Total volume after dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water:\n    *   Total Volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n*   New concentration of acetic acid:\n    *   Concentration = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. Calculate the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.**\n*   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of acid = moles of base.\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.00100 mol\n*   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration of NaOH = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   25% titration means that 25% of the equivalence volume of NaOH has been added.\n*   Volume of NaOH added = 0.25 × 10.00 cm³ = 2.50 cm³ = 0.00250 L\n*   Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M × 0.00250 L = 0.000250 mol\n*   This amount of NaOH reacts with 0.000250 mol of CH₃COOH to form 0.000250 mol of its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = Initial moles - Moles reacted = 0.00100 mol - 0.000250 mol = 0.000750 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed = 0.000250 mol\n*   The solution is now a buffer. We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   Now, calculate the pH. The ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles.\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(0.000250 / 0.000750)\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.256\n\n**4. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all 0.00100 mol of CH₃COOH has been converted to 0.00100 mol of CH₃COONa.\n*   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of diluted acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M\n*   Acetate is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate:\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Set up an equilibrium calculation for the hydrolysis:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] at equilibrium.\n    *   5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.020 - x ≈ 0.020.\n    *   5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.020\n    *   x² = (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.020 = 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26\n*   pH at the equivalence point ≈ 8.52\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 4.73; 7.00\nB) 4.26; 8.52\nC) 3.17; 6.73\nD) 4.57; 6.92\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
