    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the subsequent separation of the resulting products using different types of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n*   **Reactants:** (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Process:** This is a two-step process that results in the dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA:** This is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. For a *trans*-alkene like (E)-oct-4-ene, *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides. The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening:** The epoxide is protonated, and then attacked by a water molecule. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction, which proceeds with inversion of configuration (*anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl groups overall).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Let's trace the stereochemistry for one of the enantiomeric epoxides, say (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Attack of H₂O at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (R → S), while C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack of H₂O at C5 leads to inversion at C5 (R → S), while C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol is a *meso* compound (it has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and is superimposable on its mirror image). Both attack pathways lead to the same meso product. The other epoxide enantiomer, (4S,5S), will also yield the same *meso* diol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is *meso*-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nAlternatively, one can remember the stereochemical rule for the overall transformation, which is an *anti*-dihydroxylation:\n*   (E)-Alkene + *anti*-addition → *meso* product.\nThis confirms that Reaction 1 produces a single compound: *meso*-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n*   **Reactants:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Process:** The same *anti*-dihydroxylation sequence is performed on a *cis*-alkene.\n    1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA:** *Syn*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a single *meso* epoxide, *cis*-4,5-epoxyoctane ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening:** The *meso* epoxide undergoes acid-catalyzed opening by water (*anti*-addition).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Let's trace the stereochemistry for the *meso* epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   Attack of H₂O at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (R → S), while C5 remains S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack of H₂O at C5 leads to inversion at C5 (S → R), while C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since attack at C4 and C5 is equally likely, a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, is formed. This is a racemic mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nAlternatively, using the stereochemical rule:\n*   (Z)-Alkene + *anti*-addition → Racemic mixture.\nThis confirms that Reaction 2 produces a racemic pair of enantiomeric diols.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  ***meso*-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The *meso*-diol is a **diastereomer** of both (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time, producing a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated, producing distinct peaks.\n    *   In our mixture, the racemic pair of enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) will co-elute as one peak. The *meso*-diol, being a diastereomer to the enantiomers, will have different properties and will elute at a different time, producing a second peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two separate peaks.\n    *   The achiral *meso*-diol will also be separated from the chiral enantiomers (since they are diastereomers). It will produce its own, third peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers in the mixture, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
