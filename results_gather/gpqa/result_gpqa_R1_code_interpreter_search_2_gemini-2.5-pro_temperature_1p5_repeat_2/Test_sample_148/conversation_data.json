    "*   **Analysis of the problem:**\n    1.  **NMR Data:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with a combined integral of 1H, indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this suggests the presence of two distinct molecular species (isomers). The similar chemical shifts imply these environments are structurally very similar.\n    2.  **LC-MS Data:** The observation of two separate peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace confirms that there are two distinct chemical species that can be separated based on their different physical properties (in this case, their interaction with the chromatography column). The fact that both peaks have the identical mass spectrum (MS) confirms they are isomers (same molecular formula and mass), not an impurity like a precursor or a side product with a different mass. The MS being consistent with the expected molecule reinforces this.\n    3.  **Nature of the Compound:** The compound is a peptide. Peptides are polymers of amino acids linked by amide bonds. They contain chiral centers (the alpha-carbons of the amino acids).\n\n*   **Evaluation of the options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and on a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce only a single NMR peak and a single LC peak. This option is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would result in a molecule with a different chemical structure and a higher molecular weight than the expected product. The mass spectrometry data contradicts this, as both observed peaks have the mass of the *expected* molecule.\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would have a different chemical formula and therefore a different mass from the final product. Again, this is contradicted by the mass spectrometry data, which shows both peaks have the mass of the expected product.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. Unlike enantiomers, diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they give distinct NMR spectra (different chemical shifts for corresponding protons) and can be separated by standard, achiral chromatography (like LC).\n        *   **How could diastereomers form?** There are two common ways in peptide chemistry:\n            1.  **Epimerization:** During synthesis, the stereochemistry at one of the chiral alpha-carbons could be partially inverted (e.g., an L-amino acid could become a D-amino acid). If the peptide has other chiral centers, this would create a diastereomer (e.g., a mix of an L-L dipeptide and an L-D dipeptide).\n            2.  **Rotational Isomers (Atropisomers):** The C-N amide bond in peptides has significant double-bond character, leading to restricted rotation. This creates stable *cis* and *trans* isomers. These *cis/trans* isomers are a form of diastereomerism. The energy barrier to their interconversion is often high enough that they can be observed as separate species on the NMR and LC timescales, especially if a proline residue is involved.\n        *   Both scenarios result in a mixture of diastereomers, which perfectly explains why there are two separable species with the same mass that give distinct NMR signals for the alpha-proton adjacent to the site of isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The observation of two separable isomers with the same mass by achiral analytical techniques is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
