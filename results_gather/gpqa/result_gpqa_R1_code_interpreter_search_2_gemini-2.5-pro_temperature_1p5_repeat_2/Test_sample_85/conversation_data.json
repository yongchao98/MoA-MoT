    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2. The ring oxygen is position 1. This structure is a delta-lactone (a cyclic ester with a six-membered ring).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group is attached to carbon 4 of the ring.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O=C(2)——CH₂(3)——CH(4)——CH₂(5)——CH₂(6)\n      |              |\n      O(1)———————————C(6)\n                     |\n                     Et (Ethyl group)\n```\nThe chiral center is C4, which can be in either the (R) or (S) configuration. A lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxycarboxylic acid. To form a six-membered delta-lactone, the precursor must be a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provided are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's determine its structure:\n*   This is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid), which has a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid chain.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group is on C3.\n*   It's a mono-ester: one end is a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the other is an isobutyl ester (-CO-O-iBu). The name \"pentanoic acid\" implies the free acid group is at C1.\nThe structure is:\n```\n    HOOC(1)——CH₂(2)——CH(3)——CH₂(4)——C(5)O-O-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂\n                      |\n                      Et (Ethyl group)\n```\nThis is systematically named isobutyl hydrogen 3-ethylpentanedioate. The chiral center is C3. This starting material has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride), followed by H⁺ (acid workup).\n*   **Selectivity of LiBH₄:** LiBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces esters and ketones. It reduces esters *more readily* than carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 will remain unchanged.\n    `HOOC-...-COOiBu  + LiBH₄  -> HOOC-...-CH₂OH`\n*   **Intermediate:** The reduction yields **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Cyclization:** In the presence of acid (H⁺), this hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered delta-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at the C5 carbonyl, and the cyclization involves the C1 carbonyl and the C5 hydroxyl group. Neither of these reactions affects the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry is **retained**. The stereocenter at C3 of the acid becomes the stereocenter at C4 of the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be the **(R)**-enantiomer.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** BH₃ (borane), followed by H⁺ (acid workup).\n*   **Selectivity of BH₃:** BH₃ is known for being highly chemoselective. It reduces carboxylic acids *much faster* than it reduces esters.\n*   **Apparent Contradiction:** If BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid at C1, the intermediate would be a hydroxy-ester (`HOCH₂-...-COOiBu`). Acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification of this molecule would lead to a **seven-membered lactone (epsilon-lactone)**, which contradicts the given product (a six-membered lactone).\n*   **Resolving the Contradiction:** There is a known exception to BH₃'s typical selectivity in molecules like this. The borane first reacts with the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid to form an acyloxyborane intermediate (`R-COO-BH₂`). This borane group can then be delivered **intramolecularly** to the ester carbonyl group at C5. This intramolecular pathway effectively results in the reduction of the ester group, just like in the LiBH₄ reaction.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** Due to the intramolecular hydride delivery, BH₃ also reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid at C1 is regenerated during the acidic workup.\n    `HOOC-...-COOiBu  + BH₃  -> HOOC-...-CH₂OH`\n*   **Intermediate:** The reaction produces **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**, the same intermediate as in Reaction 1.\n*   **Cyclization:** This intermediate cyclizes to form the six-membered delta-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As with the first reaction, the transformations do not involve breaking or forming bonds at the C3 chiral center. The stereochemistry is **retained**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
