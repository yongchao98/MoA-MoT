    "E_rr_思_考_中_\n**Part 1: Thermodynamic Strength of Oxygen as an Oxidant**\n\nTo determine if oxygen is a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic solutions, we need to compare its standard reduction potential (E°) in acidic and basic media. A more positive (larger) E° value signifies a stronger oxidizing agent.\n\nThe relevant half-reactions for the reduction of oxygen are:\n\n1.  **In acidic solution:**\n    O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +1.23 V.\n\n2.  **In basic solution:**\n    O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +0.40 V.\n\nComparing the two E° values:\n+0.40 V (in basic solution) < +1.23 V (in acidic solution)\n\nSince the standard reduction potential of oxygen is significantly lower in a basic solution compared to an acidic solution, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant from a thermodynamic standpoint in basic solutions.\n\n**Part 2: Kinetic Reactivity of Oxygen**\n\nThe question asks about the kinetic reactivity of oxygen in acidic solutions. Kinetically, the reduction of oxygen is a complex multi-electron process that involves breaking a strong O=O double bond. This process has a high activation energy, making oxygen relatively unreactive (kinetically stable or inert) under standard conditions, despite being thermodynamically a strong oxidant.\n\nThe overall four-electron reduction of oxygen (O₂ → 2H₂O) does not occur in a single step. It proceeds through intermediates, such as hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). The initial steps in this reduction pathway are slow, which governs the overall reaction rate. This slowness is a well-known characteristic of oxygen electrochemistry, often referred to as a high overpotential for oxygen reduction. Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions (E° = +0.40 V) than in acidic solutions (E° = +1.23 V).\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in general due to the high activation energy of its reduction process.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct words to complete the statement are \"weaker\" and \"slower\".\n\n<<<B>>>"
