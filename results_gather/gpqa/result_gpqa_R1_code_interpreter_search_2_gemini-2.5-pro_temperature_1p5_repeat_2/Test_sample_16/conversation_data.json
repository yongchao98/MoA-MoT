    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Write the dissociation reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[CaY]^{2-}$ (where $Y^{4-}$ is the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand), dissociates in solution according to the following equilibrium:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Use the given formation constant (K_f):** The problem provides the formation constant, KCa-EDTA = $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$. The equilibrium expression for the *formation* reaction ($Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$) is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    The problem states the pH is ideal, which allows us to assume that the EDTA which is not complexed with Calcium exists as the $Y^{4-}$ species. Thus, the concentration of free $Y^{4-}$ is equal to the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$, which is 'x'.\n\n4.  **Substitute equilibrium concentrations into the $K_f$ expression:**\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x:** Since the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium lies far to the side of the complex. This means very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The expression simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we can solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions.\n    \n```python\nimport math\n\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# We need to solve for x in the equation: K_f = (initial_complex_conc) / (x**2)\n# x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n6.32e-07\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that x is approximately $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This value is indeed much smaller than 0.02 M, confirming our initial approximation was valid. The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $5.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ M\nB) $1.0 \\times 10^{-2}$ M\nC) $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\nD) $2.0 \\times 10^{-2}$ M\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Equilibrium:** The problem involves the Ca-EDTA complex, which dissociates into free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($Y^{4-}$). The equilibrium reaction for the *formation* of the complex is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n\n2.  **Use the Formation Constant (K_f):** The stability of the complex is described by the formation constant, $K_f$ (also given as KCa-EDTA).\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    We are interested in the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ when we start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex $[CaY]^{2-}$.\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations as the complex dissociates slightly. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions that form at equilibrium.\n    The dissociation reaction is: $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    *Note: The problem assumes an \"ideal pH,\" which allows us to simplify and assume the free EDTA exists entirely as the $Y^{4-}$ species. Therefore, $[Ca^{2+}] = [Y^{4-}] = x$.*\n\n4.  **Substitute into the K_f Expression:** Now we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and Solve:** Since the value of $K_f$ is extremely large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium lies very far to the left (favoring the complex). This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the approximation that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange to solve for x:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is represented by 'x'. Our calculated value is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option C. The python code output of `6.32e-07` confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
