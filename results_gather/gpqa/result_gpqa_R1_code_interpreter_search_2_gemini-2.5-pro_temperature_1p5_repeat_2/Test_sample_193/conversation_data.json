    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we need to sum the Boltzmann factor, `exp(-E * beta)`, over all possible states of the system. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, so there are a total of 2^3 = 8 possible states for the system (S1, S2, S3).\n\nThe energy of the system is given by:\nE = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is given by:\nZ = Σ_states exp(-E * β)\nwhere the sum is over all 8 possible states.\n\nLet's list all possible states and calculate their corresponding energies.\n\n**Possible States and their Energies:**\n\n1.  **All spins are the same:**\n    *   State 1: (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n        E₁ = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   State 2: (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n        E₂ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    These two states have the same energy, E = -3J.\n\n2.  **Two spins are the same, one is different:**\n    *   State 3: (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n        E₃ = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State 4: (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n        E₄ = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State 5: (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n        E₅ = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State 6: (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n        E₆ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State 7: (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n        E₇ = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State 8: (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n        E₈ = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    These six states all have the same energy, E = J.\n\n**Grouping states by energy level (Degeneracy):**\n\nWe have found two distinct energy levels for the system:\n*   **E₁ = -3J**: This energy level has a degeneracy (number of states) of **g₁ = 2**.\n*   **E₂ = J**: This energy level has a degeneracy of **g₂ = 6**.\n\nThe total number of states is g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8, which is correct.\n\n**Calculating the Partition Function:**\n\nThe partition function Z can be calculated by summing over the distinct energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g₁ * exp(-E₁ * β) + g₂ * exp(-E₂ * β)\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 * exp(-(-3J) * β) + 6 * exp(-(J) * β)\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\nB) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nOur calculated expression for the partition function Z matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
