    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h symmetry point group requires the presence of two key symmetry elements:\n1.  A **C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule is unchanged after a 120° rotation.\n2.  A **σh horizontal mirror plane**: The molecule has a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate (B(O-CH(CH3)2)3)**\n*   **Structure:** It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** To minimize steric hindrance, the three isopropoxy groups will likely arrange themselves in a propeller-like fashion. This conformation gives the molecule a **C3 axis** passing through the boron atom. However, it is not planar. It is impossible to find a conformation that has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) due to the tetrahedral geometry of the sp3-hybridized carbon atoms in the isopropyl groups. Therefore, its point group is most likely **C3**, not C3h.\n\n**C) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine with a rigid, cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** It has a **C3 axis** that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon (CH group). It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis. It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v point group**. Thus, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is more commonly known as **mellenic trianhydride** (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to it. The entire molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   Being planar, it has a **C3 axis** passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**.\n    *   Since the molecule possesses both a C3 axis and a σh plane, it has **C3h symmetry**.\n    *   Note: Upon closer inspection, this molecule also has three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, making its full point group **D3h**. However, any molecule with D3h symmetry by definition also possesses all the symmetry elements of the C3h group. It is a well-known, highly symmetric molecule and a valid example of a structure exhibiting C3h symmetry.\n\n**B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a larger analog of molecule D. It has a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core, with three anhydride groups fused to it. Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry. The fusion points described in the name are symmetrically related by a C3 axis.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   Assuming the molecule is planar (like triphenylene and mellenic trianhydride), it would also possess a **C3 axis** and a **σh plane** (the molecular plane). Its full point group would also be **D3h**.\n    *   Therefore, like molecule D, it also has C3h symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth molecules B and D have the required symmetry elements for C3h because their full point group is D3h. In a multiple-choice question format, there is typically a single best answer. Molecule D, mellenic trianhydride, is a classic, textbook example of a highly symmetric planar molecule. It is structurally simpler and its planarity is certain. Molecule B is much larger and more complex, and such complex fused systems can sometimes be forced out of planarity due to steric strain, which would make it lose its σh plane and thus its C3h symmetry. Given these considerations, molecule D is the most certain and clear-cut example of a molecule with C3h symmetry among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
