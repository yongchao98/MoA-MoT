    "**1. Analysis of dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. A biphenyl system consists of two benzene rings linked by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Key Concept: Atropisomerism.** In some substituted biphenyls, rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted or prevented by steric hindrance from bulky groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). If this restricted rotation leads to a molecule that is non-superimposable on its mirror image, the molecule is chiral and exhibits a type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism. These isomers can be separated and are optically active.\n*   **Application:** In dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, the ortho positions are all substituted with bulky groups: nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6', and methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'. These groups clash with each other, preventing the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar and thus restricting rotation. The molecule adopts a stable, twisted conformation. This twisted molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it chiral. Its mirror image is a non-superimposable enantiomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n**2. Analysis of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n*   **Structure:** This is an ester derived from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Key Concept: Chiral Center.** The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a tetrahedral carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups. Such a carbon is called a chiral center or stereocenter.\n*   **Application:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n*   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and will exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. Analysis of benzophenone:**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical name for benzophenone is diphenylmethanone. Its structure is (C6H5)â‚‚C=O.\n*   **Key Concept: Molecular Symmetry.** A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. In simpler terms, if the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, it is achiral.\n*   **Application:** The benzophenone molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of this plane of symmetry means the molecule's mirror image is identical to the original molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. Analysis of dimethyl fumarate:**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Key Concept: Molecular Symmetry.** Like benzophenone, we check for elements of symmetry. This molecule is a stereoisomer (a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate), but we need to check if it's an *optical* isomer.\n*   **Application:** The molecule is planar. The plane containing all the atoms is a plane of symmetry. Additionally, it has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. If you trace a line from any atom through this center, you will find an identical atom at the same distance on the other side. Molecules with a center of inversion are always achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>"
