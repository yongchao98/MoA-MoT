    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description**\n\n*   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two groups attached to it.\n*   **Total Carbons:** 8. The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Propose a Plausible Structure**\n\n*   Let the two substituents be R₁ and R₂.\n*   From the FTIR data, we know one substituent is a halogen, let's say R₁ = X.\n*   The other substituent, R₂, must contain the carbonyl group and the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n*   A very common and simple group that fits this description (2 carbons, one carbonyl) is the acetyl group: -C(=O)CH₃.\n*   Therefore, a highly plausible candidate for the compound is a haloacetophenone: X-C₆H₄-C(=O)CH₃.\n\n**3. Verify the Proposed Structure against All Conditions**\n\n*   **Di-substituted aromatic ring?** Yes.\n*   **Total 8 carbons?** Yes (6 in the ring + 2 in the acetyl group).\n*   **Carbonyl group?** Yes.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond?** Yes.\n*   The molecular formula would be C₈H₇XO. This means we expect a total of 7 protons in the 1H NMR spectrum (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 in the methyl group).\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Proposed Structure (Haloacetophenone)**\n\n*   The substitution pattern can be ortho, meta, or para. Let's consider the most symmetric case, para-substitution (1,4-disubstitution), as it gives a simple, characteristic NMR pattern.\n*   **Structure:** 4-haloacetophenone.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the symmetry of the para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH₃) will be one signal.\n    *   The two protons ortho to the halogen (-X) will be the second signal.\n    *   Both signals will be doublets (due to coupling to their ortho neighbors) and will integrate to 2H each. Their chemical shifts will be in the aromatic region, typically between 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. The protons next to the carbonyl group will be further downfield (at a higher ppm value).\n*   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The protons of the -CH₃ group are adjacent to a carbonyl group. They are not coupled to any other protons, so they will appear as a singlet. This singlet will integrate to 3H. Its chemical shift is typically around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n\n**5. Compare the Prediction with the Given Options**\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum:** Two doublets in the aromatic region (2H each) and one singlet in the aliphatic region (3H). Total protons = 2+2+3 = 7H.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). It is inconsistent with an aromatic compound.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only shows 1H in the aromatic region. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This is a perfect match for a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 2.3 (3H, s). This is a perfect match for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (-COCH₃).\n    *   **Total Protons:** 2 + 2 + 3 = 7H. This is consistent with our C₈H₇XO formula.\n    *   This option perfectly matches our predicted spectrum for 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The aromatic pattern suggests para-substitution. A possible structure could be 4-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), which has 8 carbons.\n    *   However, for this structure, the aldehyde proton (-CHO) should be a triplet (coupled to the -CH₂-) and the methylene protons (-CH₂-) should be a doublet (coupled to the -CHO). The option incorrectly lists both as singlets. Thus, this data is inconsistent with a logical structure.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption C provides the only 1H NMR data that is fully consistent with a molecule matching all the criteria given in the problem statement. The compound is a 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
