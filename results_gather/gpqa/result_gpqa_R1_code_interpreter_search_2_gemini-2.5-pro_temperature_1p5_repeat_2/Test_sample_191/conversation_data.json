    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We start with an uncharged, isolated spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero.\n\n2.  **Introduce the charge +q:** A point charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** According to Gauss's Law and the properties of conductors, the electric field inside the bulk of the conductor must be zero. To achieve this, the charge +q inside the cavity will induce an opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. If we consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface is zero. Therefore, the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. This implies that a total charge of **-q** is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this -q charge on the inner wall will be non-uniform, arranging itself to perfectly cancel the field of the +q charge for all points outside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (zero net charge). Since a charge of -q has been induced on the inner surface, to conserve the total charge of the conductor, a charge of **+q** must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding. The conducting material shields the outer surface from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity (+q point charge and -q on the inner surface). Because the electric field inside the conductor is zero, the charge distribution on the outer surface is not affected by the specific location of the charge inside the cavity or the cavity's position.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and is shielded from the asymmetrical charge arrangement inside, the induced charge +q will spread itself **uniformly** over the outer surface of the conductor (the sphere of radius R).\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields created by all charges:\n    *   The point charge +q inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge -q on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge +q on the outer surface.\n\n8.  **Applying the Shielding Principle:** As established in steps 3 and 5, the net electric field produced by the point charge +q and the induced charge -q on the inner surface is zero everywhere *outside* the cavity, including at point P. This is the essence of electrostatic shielding by a conducting shell.\n\n9.  **Field from the Outer Surface Charge:** Therefore, the only contribution to the electric field at point P comes from the +q charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n10. **Applying the Shell Theorem (or Gauss's Law):** For a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is +q.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is L.\n\n11. **Final Calculation:** Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{total\\_outer}}{distance^2} = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n12. **Conclusion:** The information about the cavity's radius (r), its displacement from the center (s), the distance from the cavity's center to P (l), and the angle ($\\theta$) is all extraneous and designed to test the understanding of the shielding principle. The correct expression for the electric field at point P depends only on the charge q and the distance L from the center of the conductor.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
