    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |3,0,0> to the final state |1,0,0> via an intermediate state. The mechanism for each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition.\n\n2.  **Recall the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions:**\n    For a transition from a state |n,l,m> to |n',l',m'>, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number `l` must be `Δl = l' - l = ±1`.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number `m` must be `Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1`.\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number `n` can be any integer (`Δn = n' - n` is arbitrary), but for spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, so `n' < n`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the first transition:** |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>\n    *   **Initial state:** |n=3, l=0, m=0>.\n    *   **Applying the Δl rule:** Since l=0, we must have l' = l+1 = 1. So, the intermediate state must be a p-state (l=1).\n    *   **Applying the Δn rule:** Since it's a decay, n' < 3. The options suggest the intermediate state has n'=2, which is a valid possibility (|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>). This is the `3s → 2p` transition.\n    *   **Applying the Δm rule:** Since m=0, we can have m' = m+0 = 0, m' = m+1 = 1, or m' = m-1 = -1.\n    *   Therefore, three possible intermediate states are allowed: |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n4.  **Analyze the second transition:** |n'=2, l'=1, m'> → |1,0,0>\n    *   **Final state:** |n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0>.\n    *   Let's check if the transition from our possible intermediate states is allowed.\n    *   **Applying the Δl rule:** The initial l' is 1 and the final l_f is 0. So, `Δl = 0 - 1 = -1`. This is allowed. This corresponds to a `2p → 1s` transition.\n    *   **Applying the Δm rule:** `Δm = m_f - m' = 0 - m'`.\n        *   If the intermediate state is |2,1,-1>, `Δm = 0 - (-1) = +1`. This is allowed.\n        *   If the intermediate state is |2,1,0>, `Δm = 0 - 0 = 0`. This is allowed.\n        *   If the intermediate state is |2,1,1>, `Δm = 0 - 1 = -1`. This is allowed.\n    *   Conclusion: All three cascade routes are possible according to the selection rules:\n        *   Route 1: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n        *   Route 2: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n        *   Route 3: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n5.  **Calculate the transition probability (branching ratio):**\n    The problem asks for the probability of a specific route. For a cascade decay, this is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, assuming the intermediate state has only one dominant decay channel to the final state. Here, any |2,1,m'> state can only decay to the |1,0,0> state via an E1 transition (since l=1 must go to l=0, and n=1 is the only n<2 state). Thus, the probability of the entire path is the probability of the first step.\n\n    We need to find the relative probabilities of the transitions from |3,0,0> to the three possible intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n    The initial state |3,0,0> is an s-state (l=0). It is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom has no reason to preferentially decay into a state with one value of m' over another. The three final states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1> are degenerate in energy.\n\n    Due to this symmetry, the probability of decaying into each of the three possible m' states must be equal.\n\n    Let P(m') be the probability of transitioning to the state with magnetic quantum number m'.\n    *   P(-1) = P(0) = P(1)\n    *   The total probability must sum to 1: P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1.\n    *   Therefore, `3 * P(m') = 1`, which gives `P(m') = 1/3` for each state.\n\n    So, the branching ratio for each of the three decay channels in the first step is 1/3.\n\n6.  **Match with the given options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{3}. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   C) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) >\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3}. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid decay route with the correct corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
