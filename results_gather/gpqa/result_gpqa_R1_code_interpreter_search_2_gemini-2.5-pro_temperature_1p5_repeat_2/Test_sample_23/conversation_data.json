    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, meaning it contains only Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. This is equivalent to 14.28 / 100 = 1/7.\n    *   Let the chemical formula of Z be C_n H_m. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n    *   So, `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`.\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives `7m = 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m = 12n`, or `m = 2n`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is C_n H_{2n}. This is the formula for either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen (\"is not hydrogenated\"), which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). All of these fit the C_n H_{2n} formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Mixtures and Reactions**\n    *   We have two mixtures, X and Y. Hydrogenation of either mixture under severe conditions yields *only* substance Z. This is a critical clue. It implies that all compounds in both mixtures (let's call them A, B in X and C, D in Y) have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   Mixture X contains two liquids (A and B) in an equimolar ratio. It decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   Mixture Y contains two liquids (C and D) in an equimolar ratio. It does *not* decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation catalyzed by heated platinum: `A + B -> C + D`. In this context, disproportionation means a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and another is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n    *   We know Z is one of the components of Y. Let's say C = Z. Since Z is a cycloalkane (C_n H_{2n}), it is the *reduced* product.\n    *   The other component, D, must be the *oxidized* product. It doesn't decolorize bromine water, but it can be hydrogenated to Z. This perfectly describes an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton. The corresponding aromatic compound for a cycloalkane C_n H_{2n} would typically be formed by removing 3 pairs of hydrogen atoms (6 total) to form a benzene ring. For a C_n skeleton, this would be C_n H_{2n-6}.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stoichiometry**\n    *   Let's assume the simplest C6 system first, where Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This is a very common solvent, fitting the description.\n        *   Z = C = Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n        *   The corresponding aromatic compound D would be **benzene (C6H6)**.\n        *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene, {C6H12, C6H6}. This mixture does not decolorize bromine water and its components hydrogenate to give only cyclohexane. This fits all the conditions for Y.\n    *   Now, let's look at the reaction: `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   A and B are the two liquids in the equimolar mixture X. They must both have a C6 carbon skeleton. To find their formulas, we balance the atoms.\n    *   Total carbons on the right: 6 + 6 = 12. So, A and B together must have 12 carbons. Since they both have a C6 skeleton, this is satisfied (C6 + C6).\n    *   Total hydrogens on the right: 12 + 6 = 18. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be 18.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is precisely this sum: 18.\n\n4.  **Verify the Consistency**\n    *   Can we find plausible compounds A and B? They must be unsaturated C6 compounds, and their combined hydrogen count must be 18. A logical pair would be **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Number of hydrogens = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches.\n    *   Both cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene decolorize bromine water.\n    *   The reaction `C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12` is a known catalytic hydrogen transfer. The cyclohexadiene acts as the hydrogen donor (is oxidized to benzene), and the cyclohexene acts as the hydrogen acceptor (is reduced to cyclohexane). This is driven by the formation of the very stable benzene ring.\n    *   The problem also states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. Cyclohexene has one double bond, so no conjugation. For cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (not conjugated). We can simply choose **1,4-cyclohexadiene** as the component in X to satisfy this condition.\n    *   Therefore, a mixture X of {cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene} perfectly fits all the problem's constraints, leading to a Y of {benzene, cyclohexane} and Z of cyclohexane.\n\n5.  **Consider Other possibilities and Conclude**\n    *   Could Z be methylcyclohexane (C7H14)? This would lead to Y being {methylcyclohexane (C7H14), toluene (C7H8)}. The total hydrogen count for A+B would be 14 + 8 = 22. This is also a valid chemical scenario and corresponds to option C.\n    *   However, the problem is expected to have a single unique answer. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of reaction (Zelinsky irreversible catalysis). In the absence of information to distinguish between the C6 and C7 cases, the most logical choice is the simplest, most archetypal system.\n    *   Based on the most straightforward and fundamental chemical example that fits all the criteria, we conclude the system is based on C6 hydrocarbons.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are a cyclohexene (C6H10) and a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
