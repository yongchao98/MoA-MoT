    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that compound A2 is a binary compound of element Y and Fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    Let the formula of A2 be YF_n. The mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n    Where Ar(F) is the atomic weight of Fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol) and Ar(Y) is the atomic weight of element Y.\n\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (Ar(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) + 0.3196 * n * 19.00 = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) + 6.0724 * n = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) = 12.9276 * n\n    Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can now test integer values for n (the number of fluorine atoms):\n    *   If n=1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 (Closest is Calcium, Ca, but its chemistry doesn't fit the description of forming highly oxidizing fluorides).\n    *   If n=2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 (Closest is Selenium, Se (78.96) or Bromine, Br (79.90)).\n    *   If n=3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 (Closest is Antimony, Sb (121.76)).\n    *   If n=4, Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8 (No stable element).\n    *   If n=5, Ar(Y) ≈ 202.25 (Closest is Mercury, Hg (200.59) or Thallium, Tl (204.38)).\n\n    Let's calculate the theoretical %F for the best candidates:\n    *   For **SbF3** (n=3, Y=Sb): ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 = **31.89%**. This is a very close match to the given 31.96%.\n    *   For **SeF2** (n=2, Y=Se): ɷF = (2 * 19.00) / (78.96 + 2 * 19.00) = 38 / 116.96 = **32.49%**. This match is less accurate.\n\n    Based on the %F clue alone, Y=Sb and A2=SbF3 seems the most likely answer. However, other clues in the problem create contradictions with this choice (e.g., finding a 1:1 reaction, MW of SbF5 not in options). Let's investigate the Se possibility further as it might resolve later clues.\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction involving A4 and A5.**\n    This is the central part of the question.\n    *   \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n\n    Let's test the hypothesis that **Y = Se**.\n    If Y=Se, its common fluorides are SeF2, SeF4, and SeF6.\n    The reaction is: Se + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio of reactants). This is a comproportionation reaction, where elemental Se(0) reacts with a higher-valent selenium fluoride (A4) to form a lower-valent one (A5).\n    Let's test the known reaction: **Se + SeF4 → 2SeF2**.\n    *   This reaction uses Se (element Y) and SeF4 as reactants. So, **A4 = SeF4**.\n    *   The molar ratio of reactants is 1 mole of Se to 1 mole of SeF4. This perfectly matches the \"1:1 molar ratio\" condition.\n    *   The product is SeF2. So, **A5 = SeF2**.\n    *   The problem states that A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. Let's check the hydrolysis of SeF2: `2SeF2 + 2H2O → Se + SeO2 + 4HF`. It decomposes into elemental Selenium (Se) and Selenium Dioxide (SeO2). This perfectly matches the \"formation of two substances\" condition.\n\n    This entire sequence of chemical transformations is self-consistent and fits the description perfectly if we assume Y=Se. The main discrepancy is the initial %F calculation for A2. It's plausible that A2 is the same compound as A5 (SeF2), and the provided %F value was slightly inaccurate.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on the analysis in step 2, substance A4 is Selenium Tetrafluoride (SeF4).\n    Let's calculate its molecular weight (MW).\n    Ar(Se) ≈ 78.96 g/mol\n    Ar(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    MW(SeF4) = Ar(Se) + 4 * Ar(F) = 78.96 + 4 * 19.00 = 78.96 + 76.00 = 154.96 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Match the Molecular Weight with the given ranges.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 (SeF4) is 154.96 g/mol.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 160-180\n    C) 220-240\n    D) 140-160\n\n    The value 154.96 falls within the range D) 140-160.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAlthough the initial clue about the fluorine mass percentage points strongly towards Antimony (Sb), following that path leads to multiple contradictions with the other clues in the problem (especially the reaction stoichiometry and the given molecular weight ranges). The hypothesis that Y is Selenium (Se) provides a perfectly consistent explanation for the detailed chemical reaction involving A4 and A5, which is central to finding the answer. This suggests the %F value might be an intended red herring or contain a small error. Therefore, A4 is SeF4.\n\n```python\n# Atomic weight of Selenium\nAr_Se = 78.96\n# Atomic weight of Fluorine\nAr_F = 19.00\n# Calculate the molecular weight of SeF4\nMw_SeF4 = Ar_Se + 4 * Ar_F\nprint(f\"The molecular weight of A4 (SeF4) is {Mw_SeF4} g/mol.\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the core chemical reaction:** The problem describes a specific reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction, where an element in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state to form a compound with an intermediate oxidation state. The reaction form would be: Y(0) + Y(X+)F_x → Y(Y+)F_y.\n\n2.  **Identify Element Y:** Let's consider potential candidates for element Y from the p-block, as they are known to form multiple fluorides.\n    *   A key piece of information is the mass percentage of fluorine in A2 (ɷF = 31.96%). Let's use the formula ɷF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F)) to find the molar mass of Y, Ar(Y). Rearranging gives Ar(Y) = n * Ar(F) * (1 - ɷF) / ɷF.\n        Ar(Y) = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196) / 0.3196 ≈ n * 40.45.\n        *   If n=2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to **Selenium (Se, 78.97 g/mol)** and Bromine (Br, 79.90 g/mol).\n        *   If n=3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to **Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol)**.\n        *   Let's check the theoretical %F for SeF₂: (2 * 19) / (78.97 + 2 * 19) = 38 / 116.97 ≈ 32.49%. This is a reasonable match.\n        *   Let's check the theoretical %F for SbF₃: (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 3 * 19) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.89%. This is also a very close match.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Candidates using the 1:1 reaction:** Now let's test these candidates (Se and Sb) against the 1:1 reaction clue.\n    *   **If Y is Antimony (Sb):** A known comproportionation is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. The molar ratio here is 2:3, which does not match the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n    *   **If Y is Selenium (Se):** A well-known comproportionation reaction is **Se + SeF₄ → 2SeF₂**. This reaction proceeds with a **1:1 molar ratio** of the reactants (elemental Selenium and Selenium tetrafluoride). This perfectly matches the description.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Identities of A4 and A5:**\n    *   Based on the Se + SeF₄ → 2SeF₂ reaction, element Y is **Se**.\n    *   The substance A4, which is in a solution, must be **SeF₄**. SeF₄ is a colorless solid that can form a concentrated solution.\n    *   The substance A5, the product, must be **SeF₂**.\n    *   The problem also states: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" Let's check the hydrolysis of SeF₂. The reaction is 2SeF₂ + 2H₂O → Se + SeO₂ + 4HF. This decomposition indeed produces two main selenium-containing substances: elemental Selenium (Se) and Selenium dioxide (SeO₂). This confirms our assignment.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   We have confidently identified A4 as Selenium tetrafluoride (SeF₄).\n    *   Now, we calculate its molecular weight (MW).\n    *   Atomic weight of Selenium (Se) ≈ 78.97 g/mol\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   MW(SeF₄) = Ar(Se) + 4 * Ar(F) = 78.97 + 4 * 19.00 = 78.97 + 76.00 = **154.97 g/mol**.\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Range:**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 154.97 g/mol. We compare this value to the given options:\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 160-180\n    C) 220-240\n    D) 140-160\n\n    The value 154.97 falls within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<D>>>"
