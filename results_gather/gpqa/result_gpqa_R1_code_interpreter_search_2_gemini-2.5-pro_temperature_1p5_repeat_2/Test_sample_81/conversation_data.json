    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a three-step organic reaction sequence to determine the stereochemistry of the final major product.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of Cyclooctatetraene (COT) with Maleic Anhydride**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclooctatetraene (COT) and maleic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** Cyclooctatetraene exists in a non-planar tub conformation. For it to act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction, it must adopt a planar or near-planar conformation, which is energetically unfavorable. However, upon heating, COT undergoes a thermal valence tautomerization to form bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene.\n*   This tautomer contains a reactive 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety, which acts as the diene. Maleic anhydride is a potent dienophile.\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition. According to the endo rule, which governs the kinetic product of most Diels-Alder reactions, the dienophile's electron-withdrawing groups (the anhydride part) align under the π-system of the diene. In this specific case, this leads to the formation of the *endo* adduct.\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** The product is an anhydride. The key stereochemical feature is that the anhydride ring and the cyclobutene ring (the part of the molecule not involved in the reaction) are on the same side (*syn*) of the newly formed bicyclo[2.2.2]octene framework. This is the *endo* isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Esterification of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (the *endo* anhydride) is treated with methanol (MeOH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed Fischer esterification. The anhydride ring is opened by methanol to form two methyl ester groups (-COOCH₃).\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The stereochemistry of the polycyclic carbon skeleton is unchanged. Since Product 1 was formed from maleic anhydride, the two resulting ester groups are *cis* to each other. They retain the *endo* configuration from Step 1, meaning they are *syn* to the cyclobutene ring.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with Cyclopentadiene**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (the *cis-endo* diester) and cyclopentadiene.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a second Diels-Alder reaction. Cyclopentadiene is a classic diene. Product 2 acts as the dienophile, specifically at the strained double bond of its cyclobutene ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The cyclopentadiene must approach the cyclobutene double bond. The face of the cyclobutene double bond on the same side as the rest of the molecule (the bicyclo[2.2.2]octene diester part) is extremely sterically hindered. Therefore, the cyclopentadiene will add to the opposite, less hindered face. This mode of addition is called an *exo* addition.\n*   In the resulting product, the new methano bridge (-CH₂-) from cyclopentadiene is on the opposite side of the molecule relative to the main cage, including the two ester groups. The methano bridge and the ester groups are therefore *anti* to each other.\n\n**Summary of the Final Product's Stereochemistry**\n\nThe major isomer (Product 3) has the following key stereochemical features:\n1.  The two methyl ester groups are *cis* to each other.\n2.  The two ester groups are *endo* with respect to the first Diels-Alder addition.\n3.  The addition of cyclopentadiene is *exo*, meaning the resulting methano bridge is *anti* to the two ester groups.\n\n**Analysis of the Options**\n\nWe now need to identify which of the given options corresponds to this stereochemistry. This can be challenging without visualization tools, but we can proceed by elimination.\n\n*   **Check the ester stereochemistry:** The esters must be *cis*. This comes from using maleic anhydride. In SMILES notation, two chiral centers next to each other in a ring with the same stereochemical descriptor (`[C@H]...[C@H]` or `[C@@H]...[C@@H]`) are *cis*, while different descriptors (`[C@H]...[C@@H]`) mean *trans*.\n    *   A: `O=C(OC)[C@@H]1...[C@@H]1C(OC)=O` -> `@@` and `@@`. **Cis**.\n    *   B: `O=C(OC)[C@@H]1...[C@H]1C(OC)=O` -> `@@` and `@`. **Trans**. This is incorrect.\n    *   C: `O=C(OC)[C@@H]1...[C@@H]1C(OC)=O` -> `@@` and `@@`. **Cis**.\n    *   D: `O=C(OC)[C@H]1...[C@H]1C(OC)=O` -> `@` and `@`. **Cis**.\n    So, we can eliminate option **B**.\n\n*   **Distinguishing A, C, and D:** These are all diastereomers. They differ in the stereochemistry of the ring fusions, which relate to the *endo/exo* selectivities of the two Diels-Alder reactions.\n    *   The first reaction is *endo*-selective. The second reaction is *exo*-selective due to overwhelming steric hindrance. The final product results from this *endo, exo* pathway.\n    *   The different IUPAC names reflect these different stereochemical combinations. Comparing the R/S descriptors:\n        *   **A vs C:** They share the same stereochemistry at centers {4aR, 4bR, 8aS, 8bS} but differ at {1,4,5,8}. This suggests they come from the same intermediate of the first DA reaction but differ in the stereochemistry of the second DA reaction. One is *exo* and one is *endo*. We need the *exo*.\n        *   **A vs D:** They differ in the stereochemistry at centers {4a, 8b}, suggesting they come from different intermediates of the first DA reaction (*endo* vs *exo*).\n    *   Based on established literature for this classic reaction sequence, the *endo, exo* adduct corresponds to the structure given in option A. The configuration {1R, 4S, 5R, 8S} correctly describes the *exo* addition of the cyclopentadiene, placing the methano bridge *anti* to the ester groups. The configuration {4aR, 4bR, 8aS, 8bS} describes the *endo* configuration of the initial maleic anhydride adduct.\n\nTherefore, option A represents the correct structure of the major isomer formed.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."
