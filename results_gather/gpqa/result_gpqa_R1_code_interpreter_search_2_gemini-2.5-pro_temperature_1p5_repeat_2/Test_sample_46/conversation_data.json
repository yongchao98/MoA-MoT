    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 4 usually corresponds to a benzene ring. The remaining DBE of 1 corresponds to a double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1**: The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm-1**: This strong absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. The frequency is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: This signal corresponds to 3 protons, appearing as a triplet. This is a classic pattern for a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This signal corresponds to 2 protons, appearing as a quartet. This is the corresponding methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the methyl group (-CH3). The chemical shift is very far downfield (~4.5 ppm), indicating this -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl or another very electron-withdrawing system: -O-CH2CH3. Combined with the IR data, this strongly suggests an ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet for 2 protons is typical for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2) attached to an aromatic ring. The broadness is due to quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen nucleus and/or chemical exchange. This confirms the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: These two signals are in the aromatic region. Having two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split only by their single adjacent neighbor. The two distinct chemical shifts indicate that the two substituents on the ring are different electronically. One substituent is electron-donating (the -NH2 group, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm), and the other is electron-withdrawing (the ethyl ester group, which deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting It All Together**\n    *   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   This leads to the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Has a primary amide (-CONH2), not an ester and a primary amine. Also 1,3-substituted, which contradicts the NMR.\n    *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Has a secondary amide (-NH-), not a primary amine. This would give only one N-H stretch in the IR.\n    *   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the propionate, not the alcohol portion (-O-C(=O)CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be next to the C=O at ~2.5 ppm, not next to the oxygen at ~4.5 ppm.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. It perfectly matches all the provided spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
