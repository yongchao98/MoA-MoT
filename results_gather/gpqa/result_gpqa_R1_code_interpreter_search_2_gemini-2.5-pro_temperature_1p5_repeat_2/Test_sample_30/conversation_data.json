    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration) of toluene. Toluene has a methyl group (-CH3) on a benzene ring.\n*   **Directing effect:** The methyl group is an activating group and an ortho, para-director. This means the incoming nitro group (-NO2) will be directed to the positions ortho or para to the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The major product formed is the para isomer, p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene), due to less steric hindrance compared to the ortho isomer. The ortho isomer is also formed but we will follow the major product through the sequence.\n\n    Structure of Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene): A benzene ring with a -CH3 group and a -NO2 group in a para relationship.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction. Manganese dioxide (MnO2) in sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a strong oxidizing agent that can oxidize a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Product 2:** The methyl group of p-nitrotoluene is oxidized to a carboxylic acid. The nitro group is stable under these conditions. Therefore, product 2 is p-nitrobenzoic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid).\n\n    Structure of Product 2 (p-nitrobenzoic acid): A benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -NO2 group in a para relationship.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n\n*   **Reactants:** We have p-nitrobenzoic acid, acetone, and a strong base (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This step is the most complex. There are several possibilities.\n    1.  **Acid-base reaction:** p-nitrobenzoic acid will react with NaOH to form sodium p-nitrobenzoate.\n    2.  **Janovsky/Meisenheimer reaction:** The base (NaOH) can deprotonate acetone to form an enolate anion (⁻CH₂COCH₃). This nucleophile could attack the electron-deficient aromatic ring of p-nitrobenzoate, forming a Meisenheimer complex. However, this product would be chiral and have C₁ symmetry, which is not among the options given (apart from being a subgroup).\n    3.  **Reductive Coupling:** A less common but known reaction of nitroaromatic compounds involves reduction by ketones in the presence of a strong base. The ketone (acetone) acts as a reducing agent (it gets oxidized), and the nitro compound is reduced. A common outcome of such reductions is the dimerization of the nitro compound to form an azo or azoxy compound.\n\n*   **Plausible reaction:** Given the options for the symmetry group, the formation of a highly symmetric product is likely. Let's consider the formation of the azo compound. Two molecules of p-nitrobenzoic acid are reductively coupled to form 4,4'-dicarboxyazobenzene.\n\n    2 * [O₂N-C₆H₄-COOH] --(Acetone, NaOH)--> [HOOC-C₆H₄-N=N-C₆H₄-COOH] + oxidized acetone products\n\n*   **Product 3:** The final product, 3, is 4,4'-dicarboxyazobenzene. This molecule exists as two geometric isomers: (E)- and (Z)-. The (E)-isomer (trans) is significantly more stable and is the expected product.\n\n**Symmetry analysis of Product 3: (E)-4,4'-dicarboxyazobenzene**\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of two p-carboxyphenyl groups linked by a trans -N=N- double bond. The molecule is essentially planar.\n    HOOC - [benzene ring] - N = N - [benzene ring] - COOH\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule has a center of symmetry at the midpoint of the N=N double bond. For every atom, there is an identical atom at the same distance on the opposite side of the center.\n    *   **C₂ axis:** There is a two-fold rotational axis that passes through the center of inversion and is perpendicular to the N=N bond, lying within the plane of the molecule. Rotating the molecule 180° about this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σh):** The plane containing the entire molecule is a mirror plane.\n\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses a C₂ axis, a plane of symmetry perpendicular to that axis (in this case, the C2 axis is in the plane, so this rule has a special interpretation for planar molecules), and a center of inversion belongs to the **C₂h** point group. The presence of E, C₂, i, and σh confirms the C₂h point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is C₂h.\n\n<<<C>>>"
