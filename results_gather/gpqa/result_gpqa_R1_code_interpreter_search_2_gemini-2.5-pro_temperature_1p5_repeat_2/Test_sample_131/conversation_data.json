    "This problem requires us to determine which two compounds, from a given list, are present in a 1:1 mixture, based on its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**1. Analyze the Given NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlet signals with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means that the number of protons responsible for the first signal in one molecule is equal to the number of protons responsible for the second signal in the other molecule.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlet signals with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nFirst, let's confirm the molecular formula for all candidates.\n*   Tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4): C6 + 4*C = C10. H2 + 4*3 = H14. Formula C10H14 is correct.\n*   1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2): C6 + 2*2 = C10. H4 + 2*5 = H14. Formula C10H14 is correct.\n\nNow, let's predict the spectrum for each based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since they have no adjacent protons, this signal is a **singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, which is a **singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent (ortho), two equivalent coupled protons (an A2 system) appear as a single sharp peak. This will be a **singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent, but different from the first pair. This gives two distinct signals. Both are **singlets** with integrations of **6H** each.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H + 6H).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has no element of symmetry that makes its protons equivalent in the way the others do.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. They are meta to each other, so coupling is negligible. This results in **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique environments. This would ideally lead to four separate singlets of 3H each. In practice, some signals may accidentally overlap. Published spectra show three signals with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H, indicating an accidental overlap of two of the methyl signals.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary: 2 aromatic singlets (1H + 1H), 3 or 4 aliphatic singlets.*\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving a single **singlet** of integration **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 groups couple with the CH3 groups (and vice versa). This results in a **quartet** (for the 4H of the CH2 groups) and a **triplet** (for the 6H of the CH3 groups).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).* The presence of quartets and triplets immediately disqualifies this compound, as the problem states all observed signals are singlets.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nLet's test the combination in each option against the experimental data for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet. Assuming their chemical shifts are different, the mixture will show **two singlets**. Since they both represent 2H and the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This **matches** the experimental data.\n*   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides two 6H singlets. Assuming all three signals have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also **matches** the experimental data.\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three aromatic signals with an integration ratio of 2:1:1 (or two signals with a 3:1 ratio if there's an overlap). This does not match the observed two signals in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,4-diethylbenzene would introduce a quartet and a triplet, which are not observed.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives a 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Similar to option B, this would result in three signals (ratio 2:1:1) or two signals (ratio 3:1), neither of which matches the observed data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option A) perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>"
