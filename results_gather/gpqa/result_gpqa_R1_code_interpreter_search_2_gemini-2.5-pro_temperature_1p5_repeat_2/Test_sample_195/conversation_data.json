    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n    The total energy of the system is conserved. The total energy ($E_{total}$) is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy of the spring.\n    The relativistic energy of a particle with rest mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light. Note that this includes the rest energy $mc^2$ and the kinetic energy $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\n    The potential energy stored in the spring, according to Hooke's law ($F=-kx$), is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    Therefore, the total conserved energy is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Analyze the System at Two Key Points**\n    We can equate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillator's motion: the point of maximum displacement (amplitude) and the equilibrium point.\n\n    *   **At maximum displacement (x = A):**\n        The mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v=0$.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The particle's energy is just its rest energy, $E_{particle} = 1 \\cdot mc^2 = mc^2$.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum, $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total, 1} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n        The potential energy is zero, $U(0) = 0$.\n        The particle's speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The particle's energy is at its maximum, $E_{particle} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total, 2} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n3.  **Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max**\n    By the principle of energy conservation, $E_{total, 1} = E_{total, 2}$.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$. First, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we can first invert both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the terms to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options**\n    The derived expression matches option A.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ (Matches our result)\n    *   B) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$\n    *   C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$\n    *   D) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (This is the non-relativistic limit)\n\n<<<A>>>"
