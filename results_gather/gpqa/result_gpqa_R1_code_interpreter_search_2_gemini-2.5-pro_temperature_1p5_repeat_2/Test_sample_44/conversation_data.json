    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are fermions. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n2.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In this case, a quantum state is defined by the energy level (principal quantum number *n*) and the spin orientation (spin quantum number *m_s*). Since *m_s* can be +1/2 (spin up) or -1/2 (spin down), a maximum of two fermions can occupy any given energy level *n*â€”one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n3.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by the formula:\n    E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\n    where *n* = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n\n4.  **Energy in terms of E:** The problem defines a base energy unit E = (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2mL^2). Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be written as:\n    E_n = n^2 * E\n    *   E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n    *   E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n    *   E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n    *   E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n    *   and so on.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    To find the ground state energy of the four-particle system, we fill the single-particle energy levels from the lowest energy up, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   **Level n=1 (E_1 = 1E):** We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is 2 * E_1 = 2 * (1E) = 2E.\n    *   **Level n=2 (E_2 = 4E):** We need to place the remaining two particles. We can place them in the next available level, n=2. Their combined energy is 2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy:** The total energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles.\n        E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited):**\n    The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (LUMO).\n    *   **Ground State Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n    *   **HOMO:** n=2.\n    *   **LUMO:** n=3.\n    *   **Excitation:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   **New Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n        E_1st_excited = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n        E_1st_excited = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider all possible excitations from the ground state and identify the second-lowest energy increase.\n    *   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n    *   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n    *   Let's look at other possible low-energy configurations:\n        *   **Option A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n            *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n            *   Energy = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n        *   **Option B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n            *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n            *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n        *   **Option C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n            *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n            *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\n    Comparing the excited state energies (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\n8.  **Final Result:**\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
