    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Basic Definitions:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is the apparent shift of a star's position against the background of more distant stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. It is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. Mathematically, `plx = 1/d`. For simplicity, we can assume units where the constant of proportionality is 1.\n    *   **Uniform Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number of stars per unit volume (the number density, ρ) is constant everywhere.\n\n2.  **Relate the Number of Stars to Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space around the Earth. The shell has a radius `d` and a very small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin spherical shell (dV) can be calculated as the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (dd):\n        `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   Since the star density (ρ) is constant, the number of stars (dN) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax:**\n    *   Our goal is to find how the number of stars changes with parallax (plx), not distance (d). So, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   From the definition of parallax, we have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   Now we need to find the relationship between the differential elements `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = (-1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a certain parallax range (a magnitude), we can ignore the negative sign. So, `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    *   Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * d² * dd`\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx² * d(plx))`\n    *   Simplifying this expression, we get:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\". This is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From the equation in the previous step, we can find this by dividing both sides by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴)`\n    *   Since ρ (star density) and 4π are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
