    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify all Cobalt-containing Species:**\n    In a solution of cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) and thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻), a series of complexes will form. The species present are:\n    *   `Co²⁺` (free ion)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n2.  **Define the Fraction of Each Species (α):**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n    The fraction of any single species, denoted as `α_n`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. We are interested in the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, so we need to find `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n3.  **Use Stability Constants (β):**\n    The problem provides the overall stability constants (β), which relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co²⁺]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN⁻]`).\n\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n4.  **Derive the Formula for α₂:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the equation for `c(Co)` from step 2:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n    Now substitute this and the expression for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` into the formula for `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    The problem gives the following values:\n    *   `β₁ = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = 40`\n    *   `β₃ = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = 16`\n    *   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` (We assume the ligand concentration is in large excess compared to the metal ion, so its free concentration is equal to its total concentration).\n\n    Now, we can use a python script to calculate the value of `α₂` and the final percentage.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Ligand concentration\nL = 0.1\n\n# The numerator of the alpha_2 expression is beta2 * L^2\nnumerator = beta2 * (L**2)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms from beta0 to beta4\n# We define beta0 = 1 for the free Co(II) ion\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * L) + (beta2 * L**2) + (beta3 * L**3) + (beta4 * L**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage:.1f}\")\n```\n>>>\n16.9\n<<<\n\nThe calculated percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` is 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a chemistry problem regarding complex equilibria.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe main goal is to calculate the percentage of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information:**\n*   Total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M\n*   Thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   Overall stability constants for the formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes:\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: β₁ = 9\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂]`: β₂ = 40\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: β₃ = 63\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: β₄ = 16\n\n**3. Formulate the Problem:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all the complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nWe need to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, which is:\n`Percentage = ([[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)) * 100%`\n\nThis fraction `[[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)` is also known as the distribution coefficient, `α₂`.\n\n**4. Use the Stability Constants:**\nThe overall stability constants (β) relate the concentration of each complex to the free metal ion (`[Co²⁺]`) and the ligand (`[SCN⁻]`).\n\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]¹`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nNote: For the free `Co²⁺` ion, we can consider it as the \"zeroth\" complex with `β₀ = 1`.\n\n**5. Develop the Expression for α₂:**\nSubstitute the expressions from step 4 into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactor out the common term `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow, let's write the expression for `α₂`:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels from the numerator and the denominator. This is a key simplification, showing that the distribution of species depends only on the free ligand concentration, not the total metal concentration.\n\nThe simplified formula for `α₂` is:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**6. Plug in the Values and Calculate:**\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the denominator first:\n*   Term 0 (for `Co²⁺`): 1\n*   Term 1 (for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`): `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term 2 (for `[Co(SCN)₂]`): `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term 3 (for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`): `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term 4 (for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`): `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, calculate the denominator (the sum of all terms):\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is Term 2:\nNumerator = 0.4\n\nCalculate `α₂`:\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**7. Convert to Percentage:**\nPercentage = `α₂` * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches the result from the Python code (`16.9`).\n\n**8. Final Answer Selection:**\nThe calculated percentage is 16.9%, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
