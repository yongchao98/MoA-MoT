    "## Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n    *   Lattice parameter, *a*: The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. In a simple rhombohedral lattice, this is the length of the primitive lattice vector, so *a* = 10 Å.\n    *   Interaxial angle, $\\alpha$: It's given that $\\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 30^{\\circ}$. For a rhombohedral system, this is the angle between any two primitive lattice vectors.\n    *   Miller Indices, (hkl): The plane of interest is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.\n\n3.  **Find the Relevant Formula:** I need the formula for the interplanar distance (*d*<sub>hkl</sub>) in a rhombohedral crystal system when using primitive rhombohedral axes. A standard crystallographic formula is required. I can find this through a web search or from memory of solid-state physics principles.\n\n4.  **Perform a Search (if necessary):** I will search for the formula to ensure accuracy.\n    <search>formula for interplanar distance d-spacing rhombohedral</search>\n    \n    The search provides the following formula for the interplanar distance, *d*<sub>hkl</sub>, in a rhombohedral lattice (indexed with respect to the primitive axes):\n    \n    $ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2(\\alpha) + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2(\\alpha)-\\cos(\\alpha))}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2(\\alpha)+2\\cos^3(\\alpha))} $\n    \n    This formula directly relates the interplanar spacing *d* to the Miller indices (h, k, l), the lattice parameter *a*, and the rhombohedral angle $\\alpha$.\n\n5.  **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**\n    *   h = 1, k = 1, l = 1\n    *   *a* = 10 Å\n    *   $\\alpha = 30^{\\circ}$\n\n    First, let's compute the components of the formula:\n    *   $h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3$\n    *   $hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3$\n    *   $a^2 = 10^2 = 100$\n    *   $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 0.5$\n    *   $\\cos(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.8660$\n    *   $\\sin^2(30^{\\circ}) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$\n    *   $\\cos^2(30^{\\circ}) = (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$\n    *   $\\cos^3(30^{\\circ}) = (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^3 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8} \\approx 0.6495$\n\n6.  **Calculate Numerator and Denominator:**\n    *   **Numerator**: $(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2(\\alpha) + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2(\\alpha)-\\cos(\\alpha))$\n        = $(3)(0.25) + 2(3)(0.75 - 0.8660)$\n        = $0.75 + 6(-0.1160)$\n        = $0.75 - 0.6960 = 0.054$\n    \n    *   **Denominator**: $a^2(1-3\\cos^2(\\alpha)+2\\cos^3(\\alpha))$\n        = $100 \\times (1 - 3(0.75) + 2(0.6495))$\n        = $100 \\times (1 - 2.25 + 1.299)$\n        = $100 \\times (-1.25 + 1.299) = 100 \\times (0.049)$\n        = $4.9$\n\n7.  **Calculate d<sub>111</sub>:**\n    *   $\\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{0.054}{4.9} \\approx 0.01102$\n    *   $d_{111}^2 = \\frac{1}{0.01102} \\approx 90.74$\n    *   $d_{111} = \\sqrt{90.74} \\approx 9.526$ Å\n\n8.  **Verify with a Precise Calculation (using Python):** To avoid rounding errors, I'll use a script to compute the value accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given parameters\na = 10.0  # Lattice parameter in Angstroms\nalpha_deg = 30.0  # Rhombohedral angle in degrees\nh, k, l = 1, 1, 1  # Miller indices\n\n# Convert angle from degrees to radians for trigonometric functions\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Calculate the required trigonometric values\nsin_alpha = math.sin(alpha_rad)\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\nsin_sq_alpha = sin_alpha**2\ncos_sq_alpha = cos_alpha**2\ncos_cub_alpha = cos_alpha**3\n\n# Calculate terms for the numerator\nhkl_sum_sq = h**2 + k**2 + l**2\nhkl_cross_prod_sum = h*k + k*l + l*h\n\n# Calculate the numerator of the 1/d^2 formula\nnumerator = (hkl_sum_sq * sin_sq_alpha) + (2 * hkl_cross_prod_sum * (cos_sq_alpha - cos_alpha))\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the 1/d^2 formula\ndenominator = a**2 * (1 - 3*cos_sq_alpha + 2*cos_cub_alpha)\n\n# Calculate 1/d^2\none_over_d_sq = numerator / denominator\n\n# Calculate d\nd_111 = math.sqrt(1 / one_over_d_sq)\n\nprint(d_111)\n```\n executing code...\n> 9.542866952814838\n\n9.  **Final Result and Conclusion:** The precise calculation yields $d_{111} \\approx 9.54$ Å.
