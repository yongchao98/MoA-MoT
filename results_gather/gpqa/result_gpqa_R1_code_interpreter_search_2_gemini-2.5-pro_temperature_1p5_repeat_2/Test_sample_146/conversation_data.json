    "Annihilation Process Analysis:\nThe annihilation reaction is given by $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^-$.\n\n1.  **Initial State Analysis (Energy and Momentum):**\n    *   The problem states that the antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) is \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can therefore assume both the proton ($p$) and the antiproton are effectively at rest before annihilation.\n    *   The initial momentum of the system is approximately zero.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton. Let's denote the proton's rest mass energy as $m_p c^2$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n    *   The standard value for the proton rest mass energy is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV.\n    *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Final State Analysis (Energy and Momentum):**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   We are given that the rest mass energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV. We assume $m_{A^+} = m_{A^-} = m_A$.\n    *   By the principle of conservation of momentum, since the initial momentum was zero, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero.\n    *   By the principle of conservation of energy, the total initial energy is converted into the total final energy ($E_{final}$) of the four A particles. So, $E_{final} = E_{initial}$.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the final products, the total energy will be distributed equally among the four particles. Therefore, the energy of each particle A ($E_A$) is:\n        $E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{E_{initial}}{4} = \\frac{1876.54 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Velocity:**\n    *   The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the equation $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   For particle A, we have $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n    *   We can now calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.135 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.56378$.\n    *   Now, we solve for the velocity $v$ using the definition of $\\gamma$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.56378)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$.\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis can be verified with a quick computation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Proton rest mass energy in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.27\n\n# Particle A rest mass energy in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300\n\n# Total initial energy from proton-antiproton annihilation\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Energy is distributed equally among the 4 final particles\nE_A = E_initial / 4\n\n# The total energy of a particle is E = gamma * m*c^2\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma for particle A\ngamma = E_A / m_A_c2\n\n# Calculate velocity v as a fraction of c (beta) from gamma\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\n>>>\nThe velocity of particle A is 0.77c\n<<<\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The annihilation reaction is given by $p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy of the system is conserved. We first need to calculate the total initial energy. The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which means we can neglect its kinetic energy. We assume the proton is also at rest. Therefore, the initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton ($p$) and the antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n\n    The rest mass of a proton is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton. The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_{p}c^{2} \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    \n    Total initial energy $E_{initial}$:\n    $E_{initial} = m_{p}c^{2} + m_{\\bar{p}}c^{2} = 2 \\times m_{p}c^{2}$\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n2.  **Energy Distribution:**\n    This total initial energy is converted into the total final energy of the four product particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$).\n    $E_{final} = E_{initial} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    Since the initial momentum of the system is zero (as both particles are at rest), the total energy will be distributed equally among the four final particles to conserve momentum. The energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is:\n    $E_{A} = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n3.  **Relativistic Velocity Calculation:**\n    The total energy ($E_A$) of a relativistic particle is the sum of its rest mass energy ($m_A c^2$) and its kinetic energy. The formula is:\n    $E_{A} = \\gamma m_{A}c^{2}$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n    We are given $m_{A}c^{2} = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. We can now calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_{A}}{m_{A}c^{2}} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n    Now, we can solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\n    So, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
