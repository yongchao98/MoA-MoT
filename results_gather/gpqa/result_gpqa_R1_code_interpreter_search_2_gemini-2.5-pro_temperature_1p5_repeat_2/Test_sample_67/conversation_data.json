    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   **System:** A spin-1/2 particle. Its state can be described by a two-component spinor.\n*   **Magnetic Moment:** The magnetic moment **μ** is related to the spin angular momentum **S** by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. The spin operator is **S** = (ħ/2) **σ**, where **σ** = (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) are the Pauli matrices.\n*   **Magnetic Field:** The initial magnetic field is **B**_i = B **ẑ** (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   **Hamiltonian:** The energy of the particle in the magnetic field is given by the Hamiltonian H = -**μ** ⋅ **B**.\n    *   H_i = - (γ**S**) ⋅ (B **ẑ**) = -γB S_z.\n*   **Initial State:** The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the Hamiltonian H_i.\n    *   The eigenstates of S_z are spin-up |+z⟩ (eigenvalue +ħ/2) and spin-down |-z⟩ (eigenvalue -ħ/2).\n    *   The corresponding energies are E_up = -γB(ħ/2) and E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2).\n    *   The lowest energy state is the spin-up state, E_up. In this state, the spin angular momentum S_z is positive (+ħ/2), and the magnetic moment μ_z = γS_z is also positive, hence aligned with the field **B**_i along +z.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩.\n\n### 2. Time Evolution for t > 0\n\n*   **New Magnetic Field:** At t=0, the field is suddenly switched to **B**_f = B **ŷ**. The magnitude B remains the same.\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** The system now evolves according to the new Hamiltonian H_f.\n    *   H_f = -**μ** ⋅ **B**_f = - (γ**S**) ⋅ (B **ŷ**) = -γB S_y.\n*   **Time Evolution (Schrödinger Picture):** The state of the system at a later time t is given by |ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩, where U(t) is the time evolution operator.\n    *   U(t) = exp(-i H_f t / ħ) = exp(-i (-γB S_y) t / ħ) = exp(i γB t S_y / ħ).\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** The operator U(t) represents a rotation. The general operator for a rotation by an angle θ about an axis **n** is R(**n**, θ) = exp(-i θ **n**⋅**S** / ħ).\n    *   Comparing U(t) with R(**ŷ**, θ), we have U(t) = exp(i (γBt) S_y / ħ). This corresponds to a rotation about the y-axis by an angle θ = -γBt.\n    *   This means the spin state vector (and its expectation value) will precess around the new magnetic field direction (**ŷ**) with an angular velocity ω = γB. This phenomenon is known as **Larmor Precession**, and ω = γB is the **Larmor frequency**.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Expectation Value\n\nWe want to find the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the moment, which is the expectation value ⟨μ_z(t)⟩.\n\n⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.\n\nWe can solve this in a few ways:\n\n**Method 1: Direct Calculation in the z-basis**\n\n1.  Calculate |ψ(t)⟩:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(i γB t S_y / ħ) |+z⟩. Using S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(i (γBt/2) σ_y) |+z⟩.\n    We use the identity exp(iα σ_j) = cos(α) I + i sin(α) σ_j. Here α = γBt/2 and j=y.\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(γBt/2) I + i sin(γBt/2) σ_y] |+z⟩\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2) |+z⟩ + i sin(γBt/2) (σ_y |+z⟩).\n    Since σ_y |+z⟩ = i |-z⟩, we get:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2) |+z⟩ + i² sin(γBt/2) |-z⟩ = cos(γBt/2) |+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2) |-z⟩.\n\n2.  Calculate ⟨S_z(t)⟩:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.\n    S_z operating on |ψ(t)⟩ gives S_z |ψ(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) [cos(γBt/2) |+z⟩ + sin(γBt/2) |-z⟩].\n    Taking the inner product with ⟨ψ(t)| = cos(γBt/2) ⟨+z| - sin(γBt/2) ⟨-z|:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)].\n    Using the trigonometric identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ):\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(γBt).\n\n3.  Find the frequency:\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the spin is ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(ωt), where the angular frequency of oscillation is ω = γB.\n    The expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt).\n\n**Method 2: Classical Analogy (Larmor Precession)**\n\n*   A classical magnetic moment **μ** in a magnetic field **B** experiences a torque **τ** = **μ** x **B**.\n*   This torque changes the angular momentum **S** (where **μ** = γ**S**) according to d**S**/dt = **τ**.\n*   So, d**S**/dt = γ (**S** x **B**).\n*   This equation describes the precession of the vector **S** around the vector **B** at an angular frequency ω = γB.\n*   In our case, the magnetic field **B** is along the y-axis. The initial spin is along the z-axis. The spin vector will precess in the x-z plane around the y-axis.\n*   The z-component of the spin, S_z, will vary as S_z(t) = S_z(0) cos(ωt).\n*   The oscillation frequency is therefore the Larmor frequency, ω = γB.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nBoth quantum mechanical and classical approaches show that the z-component of the spin (and thus the magnetic moment) oscillates with an angular frequency ω = γB.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, and the options are given in terms of angular frequency.\n\n*   A) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n*   B) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n*   C) gamma*B\n*   D) gamma*B/2\n\nThe calculated frequency is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>"
