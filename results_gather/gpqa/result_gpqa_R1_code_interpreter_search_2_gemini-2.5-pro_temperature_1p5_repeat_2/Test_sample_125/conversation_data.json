    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is chiral and has one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), with a defined (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of a ketone with Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)).\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction. It remains (S).\n    *   The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl, leading to two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of two stereocenters. This makes them **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is an achiral reducing agent.\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers). (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are enantiomers, so they will be formed as a racemic pair.\n    *   Now, let's consider the (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) isomers. Due to the symmetry in the molecule (the two ends, C1-C2 and C4-C5, are identical), the (2R, 4S) isomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry in certain conformations, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, three stereoisomers are formed from Reaction II:\n        1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (the enantiomer of the first)\n        3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (a diastereomer of the other two)\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture for HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nNow, let's determine how these will be separated by the two types of HPLC.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Separation Principle:** Separates compounds based on differences in polarity. An achiral column cannot distinguish between enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment. However, diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   Product 1 and Product 2 are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Product 3 and Product 4 are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   Product 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of products 3 and 4. It has a different polarity and will be separated from them, giving its own **single peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different polarities. Thus, the set of peaks from Reaction I will be well-separated from the set of peaks from Reaction II.\n    *   Total Peaks = (Peak for P1) + (Peak for P2) + (Peak for P3/P4 pair) + (Peak for P5) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   **Separation Principle:** A chiral stationary phase interacts differently with different stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   A chiral column will separate all stereochemically distinct compounds.\n    *   The five products in the mixture are all unique stereoisomers.\n        *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of the first)\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of the third)\n        *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of all others)\n    *   Since all five compounds are different stereoisomers, the chiral column will resolve all of them. The achiral meso compound will also be separated from the others as it is a diastereomer.\n    *   Total Peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
