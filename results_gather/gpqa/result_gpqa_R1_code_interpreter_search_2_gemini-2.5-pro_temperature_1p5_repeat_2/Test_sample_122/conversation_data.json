    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S). This is considered the \"stationary\" frame for our calculation.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S'). This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the known variables.**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame, S') is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock at rest in its own frame.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal.**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n    *   The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n\n4.  **Apply the concept of time dilation.**\n    *   According to special relativity, time passes more slowly in a moving reference frame relative to a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The time measured in the stationary frame (S), `Δt`, is longer than the proper time measured in the moving frame (S'), `Δt'`.\n    *   The relationship is given by the formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    *   The formula for the Lorentz factor is `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.02062`\n\n6.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    *   So, while 50 seconds pass for an observer on the ejecta, about 51.03 seconds pass for an observer in the Galaxy.\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\n    *   Now we can use the distance formula `d = v * Δt`.\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    *   Our calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        A) 2,940,000 km\n        B) 3,060,000 km\n        C) 2,880,000 km\n        D) 3,000,000 km\n    *   The calculated value is extremely close to option B. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\nA more precise calculation can be done without intermediate rounding:\n`d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt') = v * Δt' / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n`d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # velocity in km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # proper time in seconds\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s (standard approximation)\n\n# Non-relativistic distance (for comparison, this would be option D)\n# d_classical = v * dt_prime = 3,000,000 km\n\n# Relativistic calculation\n# Calculate beta\nbeta = v / c\n# Calculate beta squared\nbeta_sq = beta**2\n# Calculate the denominator for gamma\ndenom = math.sqrt(1 - beta_sq)\n# Calculate time in the Galaxy frame\ndt = dt_prime / denom\n# Calculate distance in the Galaxy frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"{distance=:.2f} km\")\n```\n>>>\ndistance=3061862.18 km\n>>>\n\nThe calculated distance is 3,061,862.18 km, which is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem is solved using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame.
