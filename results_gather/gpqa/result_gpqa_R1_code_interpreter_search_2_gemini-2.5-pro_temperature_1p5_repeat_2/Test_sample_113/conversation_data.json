    "*   **Analysis of the First Reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻), provided by NaCN, is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the partially positive carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n        3.  The negatively charged oxygen atom of the alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin product.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to complete the reaction. In a laboratory setting, this is typically achieved by adding an acid. H₃O⁺ is the chemical formula for the hydronium ion, which is the standard representation of an acid in an aqueous solution. Therefore, reagent A is an acid source, represented by H₃O⁺. Using a strong acid directly with NaCN must be done carefully as it can liberate toxic HCN gas, but an acidic medium is necessary for the final protonation step.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Second Reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of nitriles is a standard organic transformation that requires harsh conditions, typically catalysis by a strong acid or a strong base with heating.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis in the presence of water.\n        *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid)** is a strong acid. Strong acids are very effective catalysts for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction proceeds by protonating the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid)** is a weak acid. It is not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions. The reaction would be extremely slow or might stop at the amide stage.\n    *   Therefore, the suitable reagent B is a strong acid, which is HCl.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, reagent A is an acid source, H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, reagent B is a strong acid catalyst, HCl.\n    *   Matching these reagents with the given options, we find that option C provides the correct combination.\n\n<<<C>>>"
