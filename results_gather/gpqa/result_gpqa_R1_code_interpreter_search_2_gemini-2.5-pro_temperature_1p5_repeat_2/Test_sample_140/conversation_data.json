    "This problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of a substituted haloarene with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere's a detailed step-by-step breakdown of the mechanism:\n\n**1. The Reactant and Reagent**\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is bonded to a bromine atom (Br), and the carbon at position 2 is bonded to a deuterium atom (d). All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are bonded to hydrogen (H).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a source of the very strong base, the amide anion (:NH₂⁻).\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe amide anion (:NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts an acidic proton from the benzene ring. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing bromine atom are the most acidic. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine:\n*   **Position C2:** This position holds a deuterium atom (d).\n*   **Position C6:** This position holds a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThe base can abstract either the deuteron from C2 or the proton from C6. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than the C-D bond. However, both reactions are possible and will occur, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. The resulting carbanion at C6 then expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n    *   **Intermediate A:** 3-deuterobenzyne.\n\n*   **Pathway B (d-abstraction):** The base removes the deuteron (d⁺) from C2. The resulting carbanion at C2 then expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring.\n    *   **Intermediate B:** Benzyne (non-deuterated).\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide anion (:NH₂⁻), attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and there is a deuterium at C2. The amide anion can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest possible number (position 1), this product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Thus, Pathway A yields **two** distinct products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. The amide anion can attack either C1 or C2 of the triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Regardless of which carbon is attacked, after protonation, the resulting product is the same: aniline (C₆H₅NH₂).\n    *   Thus, Pathway B yields only **one** product: aniline.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find a total of three distinct organic products that can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
