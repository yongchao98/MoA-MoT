    "An optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has a double bond. The carbons of the double bond are sp2 hybridized and cannot be chiral centers.\n    *   Let's check other carbons for chirality (being attached to four different groups).\n        *   The methyl carbon on the double bond is attached to the C=C.\n        *   The -CH2- carbon is attached to two identical hydrogen atoms.\n        *   The terminal -CH3 carbon is attached to three identical hydrogen atoms.\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the double bond and the atoms attached to it). Therefore, it is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself provides specific stereochemical descriptors: (3aR, 7aS, E).\n    *   The `R` and `S` designations specify the absolute configuration at chiral centers. The `E` specifies the geometry at the double bond.\n    *   When a specific non-racemic stereoisomer is named (i.e., it's not a meso compound), it is, by definition, a single enantiomer or diastereomer.\n    *   Such a compound is **chiral** and therefore optically active. The complex bridged structure makes it highly unlikely to be a meso compound, and the specific R/S labels confirm its chirality.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   This is a classic example of a molecule that can form meso compounds. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to internal symmetry.\n    *   For a molecule with two chiral centers like this, where the substituents on both centers are identical (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon), the (R,S) stereoisomer is the meso form.\n    *   The molecule has a center of inversion in its staggered anti-conformation and a plane of symmetry in its eclipsed syn-conformation. Due to this internal symmetry, it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a meso compound and is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above.\n    *   The configuration is (R,R). Its mirror image is (S,S).\n    *   The (R,R) and (S,S) isomers are not superimposable on each other. They are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The molecule does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3-C4) and a hydroxyl group (at C1).\n    *   The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) -CH2-CH= (C2 side), and 4) -CH=CH- (C6 side).\n    *   Since C1 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer. A molecule with one chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This molecule has three hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. There are two stereoisomers.\n    *   The all-`cis` isomer (where all OH groups are on the same side of the ring) is highly symmetric. It possesses a C3 axis of rotation and three planes of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, it is **achiral**.\n    *   The `cis,trans` isomer (e.g., OH at C1 and C3 are `cis`, but OH at C5 is `trans` to them) lacks any plane or center of symmetry and is chiral. It exists as a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The nomenclature `(1s,3s,5s)` is not standard IUPAC, but the format strongly suggests it is specifying the absolute configuration at three distinct chiral centers (similar to R/S notation). This would only be possible if the carbons C1, C3, and C5 are chiral centers, which is true only for the chiral `cis,trans` isomer. Designating a specific configuration like (1S,3S,5S) would refer to a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it's most logical to assume this name refers to the chiral isomer, making the compound **chiral** and optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Following IUPAC naming rules, the parent chain is butan-1-one, which is a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. The chain is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-`. A cyclopentyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1).\n    *   The full structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon in the `CH` group is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` group. Since it's bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   There are no other chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule also possesses a plane of symmetry in at least one of its conformations.\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n**Summary of Optically Active Compounds:**\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione** (Chiral)\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid** (Chiral)\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol** (Chiral)\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol** (Chiral)\n\nThere are 4 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<B>>>"
