    "*   **Step 1: Define Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where 'n' is the number density of target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze λ1 (Gas-Gas MFP)**\n    λ1 refers to the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules. The moving particles and the target particles are both gas molecules. The relevant cross-section is the gas-kinetic cross-section (σ_gg), which is determined by the physical size of the molecules. The formula, accounting for the motion of target particles, is λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg). Here, 'n' is the number density of gas molecules.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze λ2 (Electron-Gas MFP)**\n    λ2 refers to the mean free path of high-energy electrons from the TEM beam scattering off the stationary gas molecules. The moving particles are electrons, and the target particles are gas molecules. The relevant cross-section is the total electron scattering cross-section (σ_eg). Since the gas molecules are essentially stationary compared to the relativistic electrons (1000 kV = 1 MeV), the formula is λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg).\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n    To compare λ1 and λ2, we must compare their respective collision cross-sections.\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Kinetic Cross-Section):** This represents a \"billiard ball\" type collision between two neutral molecules. The interaction is short-range. For a typical gas like N2, the kinetic diameter is about 0.36 nm, leading to a cross-sectional area on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m² or 10⁻¹⁵ cm².\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron Scattering Cross-Section):** This represents the interaction of a high-energy point particle (the electron) with the electromagnetic field of a gas molecule. For very high-energy electrons (1 MeV), the interaction time with any single molecule is extremely short. This phenomenon, sometimes called \"transparency,\" means the electron is less likely to be significantly deflected. Detailed calculations and experimental data show that the total scattering cross-section for a 1 MeV electron on a light-element gas molecule (like N2) is significantly *smaller* than the gas-kinetic cross-section (σ_gg). Data from physics databases suggest σ_eg is several orders of magnitude smaller than σ_gg.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the Relationship between λ1 and λ2**\n    Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), and we have established that σ_eg << σ_gg, it follows that:\n    λ2 >> λ1\n\n    The mean free path for an electron scattering off gas molecules is much longer than the mean free path for gas molecules colliding with each other. The electron, being a very fast and small particle, can travel much farther on average before a significant scattering event occurs.\n\n*   **Step 6: Evaluate the Options**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect. The collision physics are different.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. This would imply the electron scatters more easily, which contradicts the physics of high-energy particle interactions.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. Since we found that λ2 is much greater than λ1 (λ2 >> λ1), it is certainly greater than 1.22 times λ1. This statement is a correct, albeit conservative, description of the relationship.\n    *   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This places an upper bound on λ2 that is far too small. Our analysis shows λ2 is orders of magnitude larger than λ1.\n\nTherefore, the only logically and physically sound conclusion among the choices is that λ2 is larger than λ1 by at least a factor of 1.22.\n\n<<<C>>>"
