    "This question asks to identify which mutation in a gene is most likely to eliminate the production of an anti-nutritional compound. The most effective way to eliminate the function of a gene is to introduce a mutation that prevents the synthesis of a full-length, functional protein.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the gene and the mutations:\n\n1.  **Intact Gene Analysis:**\n    *   The sequence is `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`.\n    *   It starts with `ATG`, which is the universal start codon, coding for the amino acid Methionine (Met).\n    *   It ends with `TGA`, which is one of the three stop codons, signaling the end of protein synthesis.\n    *   Let's look at the first few codons: `ATG` (Met), `TTT` (Phe), `CTC` (Leu), `GCT` (Ala), `GGT` (Gly), `ACT` (Thr).\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Mutations:** We need to find the mutation that is most disruptive to the protein's structure and function. A mutation that introduces an early stop codon (a nonsense mutation) is the most likely candidate because it leads to a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Intact: `...TTT CTC...` (Phe, Leu)\n        *   Mutant: `...TTC TAC...` (Phe, Tyr)\n        *   Here, `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, meaning it changes one amino acid for another. While this could potentially affect the protein's function, it's not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein will still be produced at its full length.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Intact: `...TTT CTC...` (Phe, Leu)\n        *   Mutant: `...TTC TAA...` (Phe, STOP)\n        *   Here, `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. The machinery that synthesizes the protein will stop at this point, creating a very short, non-functional peptide (only two amino acids long: Met-Phe). This is extremely likely to completely eliminate the gene's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Intact: `...CTC GCT GGT ACT...` (Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr)\n        *   Mutant: `...TAC GCT GGT GTC...` (Tyr, Ala, Gly, Val)\n        *   This mutant has two changes: `CTC` to `TAC` (Leu -> Tyr) and `ACT` to `GTC` (Thr -> Val). These are both **missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, this will produce a full-length protein with altered amino acids. It might disrupt function, but it's less certain than a nonsense mutation.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Intact:  `...CTCGCT GGT ACTT...`\n        *   Mutant:  `...TACGCT --- ACTT...`\n        *   Comparing the sequences, we see a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`) and a deletion of the codon `GGT`. A deletion of three nucleotides is an **in-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid (Glycine) and changes another (Leu -> Tyr). The rest of the protein will be synthesized in the correct reading frame. Again, this will likely alter the protein but is not as certain to destroy its function as a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 is the only one that introduces a premature stop codon. This **nonsense mutation** will halt protein synthesis very early, guaranteeing the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
