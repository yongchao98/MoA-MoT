    "SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It is an effective field theory that extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators. The construction of SMEFT follows certain fundamental principles of quantum field theory. Let's analyze the symmetries in question:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental spacetime symmetry that relates the observations of different inertial observers. Any relativistic quantum field theory, including the Standard Model and its effective field theory extensions like SMEFT, is constructed to be Lorentz invariant. All terms (operators) in the Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare symmetry:** This is a larger spacetime symmetry group that includes Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) and spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare invariance is a cornerstone of the construction of the Standard Model and its extensions. The SMEFT Lagrangian as a whole is invariant under Poincare transformations. Therefore, Poincare symmetry must be respected. Note that respecting Poincare symmetry automatically implies respecting Lorentz symmetry.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge conjugation (C) and Parity (P) transformations. It is well-established, both experimentally and theoretically, that CP symmetry is violated in the Standard Model, specifically in the weak interactions described by the CKM matrix. SMEFT is designed to parameterize all possible new physics effects, including new sources of CP violation. Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry; in fact, many operators can violate it.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time reversal (T) transformations. The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT-invariant. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, all operators within it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nIn summary:\n-   Lorentz symmetry (1) **must** be respected.\n-   Poincare symmetry (2) **must** be respected.\n-   CP symmetry (3) is **not** required to be respected.\n-   CPT symmetry (4) **must** be respected.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
