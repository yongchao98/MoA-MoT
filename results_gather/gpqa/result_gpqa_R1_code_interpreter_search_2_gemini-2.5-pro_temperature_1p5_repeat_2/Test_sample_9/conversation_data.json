    "*   **Analysis of the Options**\n\n    1.  **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially Earth, which serves as our baseline. The density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this density ρ_E.\n\n    2.  **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to Earth's density (ρ_E).\n\n    3.  **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** \"Same composition\" implies it's made of the same materials (e.g., iron, silicates) in the same proportions as Earth. However, being 5 times more massive means it has significantly stronger gravity. This immense gravitational force compresses the materials much more tightly than in Earth. Increased compression of the same amount of matter into a smaller-than-proportional volume results in a higher overall density. Therefore, this planet's density will be significantly greater than Earth's (ρ > ρ_E).\n\n    4.  **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Similar to option (c), the composition is the same as Earth's. However, with only half the mass, its gravity is weaker. The weaker gravity leads to less compression of its constituent materials compared to Earth. Less compression means the material is less tightly packed, resulting in a lower overall density. Therefore, this planet's density will be less than Earth's (ρ < ρ_E).\n\n*   **Comparison**\n\n    *   Planet a: Density ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Planet b: Density ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n    *   Planet c: Density > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to gravitational compression)\n    *   Planet d: Density < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to less gravitational compression)\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    By comparing the densities, it is clear that the planet in option (c) will have the highest density because its large mass causes significant gravitational compression of its materials.\n\n<<<C>>>"
