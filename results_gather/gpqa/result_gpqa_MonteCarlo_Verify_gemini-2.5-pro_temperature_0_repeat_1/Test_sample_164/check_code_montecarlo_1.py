Aluminum-based activators, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified methylaluminoxanes (MMAO), are very common and effective cocatalysts for the ethylene oligomerization step (e.g., with chromium catalysts), which is the 'essential additional reaction' to create comonomers."

Group VIa (more commonly Group 6) metals, particularly Chromium (Cr), are used in well-known catalyst systems (e.g., Phillips-type catalysts with PNP pincer ligands) for the selective oligomerization of ethylene into alpha-olefins like 1-hexene.

Late transition metals like Palladium (a noble metal) and Nickel can polymerize ethylene and introduce branches via a 'chain-walking' mechanism. They are also expensive. However, this is a different mechanism from the dual-catalyst system for in-situ comonomer generation implied by the question, making it less relevant."
