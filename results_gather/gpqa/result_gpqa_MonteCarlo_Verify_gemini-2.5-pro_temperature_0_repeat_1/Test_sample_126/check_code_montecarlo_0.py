    # --- 2. Analyze the Reactant and Reaction ---
    # Reactant: 5-butylnona-2,6-diene
    # Structure: CH3(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH2(4)-CH(5)(Butyl)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH2(8)-CH3(9)
    # Reaction: Heating a 1,5-diene triggers a [3,3]-sigmatropic (Cope) rearrangement.
    # The rearranging system involves 6 carbons: C2 through C7.

    # Identify substituents on the rearranging core:
    substituents = {
        'C2': 'methyl',  # The C1 carbon
        'C5': 'butyl',   # The butyl group at position 5
        'C7': 'ethyl'    # The C8-C9 carbons
    }

    # --- 3. Simulate the Rearrangement ---
    # Bond changes in Cope rearrangement:
    # - Break: C4-C5 sigma bond
    # - Form: C2-C7 sigma bond
    # - Shift pi bonds: C2=C3 -> C3=C4 and C6=C7 -> C5=C6

    # --- 4. Derive the Product's IUPAC Name ---
    # a) Find the new main chain containing the new double bonds (C3=C4 and C5=C6).
    # The new chain is formed by C4-C3-C2-C7-C6-C5 and the attached butyl group.
    # Length = 6 (from core) + 4 (from butyl) = 10 carbons.
    # Parent name part: "deca"

    # b) Number the new chain to give double bonds the lowest locants.
    # The old C4 (a -CH2-) becomes a terminal =CH2, so numbering starts there.
    # New numbering (C'):
    # C1' = C4(old), C2' = C3(old), C3' = C2(old), C4' = C7(old),
    # C5' = C6(old), C6' = C5(old), C7'-C10' = butyl chain carbons.

    # c) Locate the new double bonds.
    # - New C3=C4 bond is at C1'-C2'. Locant = 1.
    # - New C5=C6 bond is at C5'-C6'. Locant = 5.
    # Diene name part: "-1,5-diene"

    # d) Locate the substituents on the new chain.
    # - The 'methyl' group on old C2 is now on C3'. -> "3-methyl"
    # - The 'ethyl' group on old C7 is now on C4'. -> "4-ethyl"

    # e) Assemble the full name (substituents in alphabetical order).
