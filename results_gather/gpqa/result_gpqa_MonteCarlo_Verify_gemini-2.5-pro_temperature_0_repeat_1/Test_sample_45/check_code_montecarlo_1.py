    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the chemistry question.
    Question: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?
    Answer: C) 4, based on the interpretation of counting chromatographically separable fractions.

    The function works by:
    1. Defining the product of the self-metathesis reaction: 3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.
    2. Enumerating all possible stereoisomers from the couplings of (R) and (S) reactants.
    3. Identifying the set of unique stereoisomers, accounting for the existence of a meso compound.
    4. Grouping the unique stereoisomers into chromatographically separable fractions (racemates and meso compounds).
    5. Counting the number of fractions and comparing it to the given answer (4).
