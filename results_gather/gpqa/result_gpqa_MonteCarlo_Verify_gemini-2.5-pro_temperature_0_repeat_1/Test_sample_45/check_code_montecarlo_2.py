def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the chemistry question:
    "Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?"

    The logic is based on analyzing the stereoisomers formed during the self-metathesis reaction.
    The number of "products" is interpreted as the number of unique, separable chemical entities,
    where a racemic mixture counts as one product and a meso compound counts as one product,
    as they are diastereomeric to other products and thus separable by standard techniques like chromatography.

    # The reactant is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. This means we have a 50/50 mixture
    # of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.

    # The reaction is self-metathesis, which produces 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene and ethene.
    # We need to count the stereoisomers of 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.

    # The product has two chiral centers (C3 and C6) and a double bond (C4) that can be E or Z.

    # We consider three types of reaction pairings: R+R, S+S, and R+S.

    # For the E-isomer of the double bond:
    # (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene is a chiral molecule.
    # (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene is its enantiomer.
