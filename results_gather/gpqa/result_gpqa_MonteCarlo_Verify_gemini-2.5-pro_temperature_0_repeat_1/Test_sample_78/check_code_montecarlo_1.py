def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the chemistry question.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Analyze the product's NMR spectra to deduce its key structural features.
    2.  Check the molecular formula of all options against the given formula for Compound X (C11H12O).
    3.  Compare the structural features of the options with the features deduced for the product.
        A rearrangement reaction preserves the carbon skeleton and atom count. Therefore, if the product
        has a specific substructure (like a p-tolyl group), the reactant (Compound X) must also have it.
    4.  Eliminate options that don't match the formula or cannot form the product.
    5.  Confirm that the proposed answer (Option D) is consistent with all data and that a plausible
        reaction mechanism exists.

    # --- Step 1: Analyze the Product from NMR Data ---
    # 1H NMR: δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).
    # 13C NMR: δ 21.3, 28.4, 126.9 (2C), 127.1, 129.1 (2C), 130.3, 141.5, 144.1, 197.7.

    # Deduction 1: Presence of a ketone.
    # The 13C NMR signal at δ 197.7 is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl carbon.
    
    # Deduction 2: Presence of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.
    # The 1H NMR shows two doublets in the aromatic region (7.08 and 7.71 ppm), each integrating to 2H.
    # This is a classic AA'BB' pattern for a para-substituted ring.
    # The 13C NMR supports this with two signals for 2 carbons each (126.9 and 129.1 ppm).

    # Deduction 3: Presence of two distinct methyl groups.
    # The 1H NMR shows two sharp singlets at 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, each for 3H.
    # The 13C NMR shows two signals in the aliphatic region (21.3 and 28.4 ppm).
    # One methyl (~21 ppm) is typical for a methyl on a benzene ring (a tolyl group).
    # The other methyl (~28 ppm) is consistent with a methyl ketone (acetyl group).

    # Conclusion on Product Structure:
    # The product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone with a p-tolyl group and an acetyl group.
    # The structure is 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.
    # A key feature of the product is the p-tolyl group (a methyl group on a benzene ring).

    # --- Step 2: Evaluate the Options ---

    # The reaction is an isomerization, so the reactant must have the same atoms as the product.
    # Specifically, if the product has a p-tolyl group, the reactant must also have one.

    # Check Option C for the most basic constraint: molecular formula.

            return f"Incorrect. The molecular formula of Option C is {options['C']['formula']}, which does not satisfy the required formula {question_formula} for Compound X."
    
    # Check remaining options for the structural constraint: presence of a p-tolyl group.
    # A p-tolyl group is a methylphenyl group. A styryl/phenyl group is not a tolyl group.
    
    # Option A: Contains a styryl group (phenyl), not a tolyl group.
    if provided_answer == "A":
        return "Incorrect. Option A contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. The product's NMR data clearly indicates a p-tolyl group is present (from the para-substituted pattern and one of the methyl singlets)."

    # Option B: Contains a phenyl group, not a tolyl group.
    if provided_answer == "B":
        return "Incorrect. Option B contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. The product's NMR data clearly indicates a p-tolyl group is present."

    # Option D: Contains a 4-methylstyryl group, which includes the required p-tolyl substructure.
    # It has the correct formula C11H12O.
    # The reaction is a known base-catalyzed isomerization of a terminal vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated methyl ketone.
    # This option is consistent with all the evidence.
    if provided_answer == "D":
        return "Correct"
    else:
        # This case handles if the provided answer was something other than A, B, C, or D.
        return f"Incorrect. The provided answer is {provided_answer}, but the analysis shows that only Option D is consistent with all the data. It has the correct formula (C11H12O) and the necessary p-tolyl substructure to form the product identified from the NMR spectra."
