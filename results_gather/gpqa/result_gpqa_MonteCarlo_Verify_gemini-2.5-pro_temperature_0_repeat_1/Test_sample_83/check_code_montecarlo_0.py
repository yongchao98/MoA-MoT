    # Premise 1: The problem is to parallelize the solution of u_new = R(A*dt)*u_old,
    # where R is a rational function P/Q.
    # Premise 2: A sequential algorithm solves one large system: Q(A*dt)*u_new = P(A*dt)*u_old.
    # Premise 3: A parallel algorithm must break this into multiple independent, smaller tasks.

    # Evaluation of Option A: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation
    # A partial fraction expansion of R(z) = P(z)/Q(z) has the form:
    # R(z) = c_0 + sum(c_j / (z - r_j))
    # Applying this to the matrix A*dt gives:
    # u_new = (c_0*I + sum(c_j * (A*dt - r_j*I)^-1)) * u_old
    # This means solving for y_j in (A*dt - r_j*I)*y_j = u_old for each j.
    # These solves for y_j are independent and can be done in parallel.
    # Conclusion: This method directly converts the sequential problem into a parallel one.
