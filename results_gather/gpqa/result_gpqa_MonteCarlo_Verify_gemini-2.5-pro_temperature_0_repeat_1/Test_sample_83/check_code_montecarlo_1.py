def check_correctness_of_answer():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer by demonstrating the principle
    that partial fraction decomposition enables parallelization of matrix exponential approximations.

    The question asks for the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm to a parallel one
    for solving higher-dimensional heat equations. The provided answer is "A) Linear partial fraction
    of fractional approximation".

    This code will:
    1. Define a rational approximation R(z) = P(z)/Q(z) for the exponential function exp(z).
    2. Simulate a time step using a sequential approach: u_new = inv(Q(A*dt)) @ P(A*dt) @ u_old.
    3. Use partial fraction decomposition to break R(z) into simpler terms: R(z) = sum(c_j / (z - r_j)).
    4. Simulate a time step using a "parallel" approach based on this decomposition. This involves
       solving multiple independent linear systems.
    5. Compare the results of the sequential and parallel approaches.

    If the results are identical, it confirms that the partial fraction decomposition is indeed
    the mathematical tool that allows breaking a single large problem into multiple smaller,
    independent (and thus parallelizable) problems. This validates answer A.
