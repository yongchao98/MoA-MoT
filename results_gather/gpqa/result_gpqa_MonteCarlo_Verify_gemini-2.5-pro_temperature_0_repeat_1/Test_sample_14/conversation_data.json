    "Here is a breakdown of the problem using randomized exploration, followed by a deterministic verification.\n\nThe probability of a planet transiting its star (assuming random orbital inclination and a circular orbit) is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's semi-major axis: `p = R_star / a`.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2: `p1 / p2`.\n\nFrom Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis `a` is related to the orbital period `P` and the host star's mass `M_s` by `a³ ∝ M_s * P²`. Therefore, `a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`.\n\nSubstituting this into the probability formula gives: `p ∝ R_star / (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`.\n\nThe ratio of probabilities is:\n`p1 / p2 = (R_s1 / (M_s1 * P1²)^(1/3)) / (R_s2 / (M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3))`\n`p1 / p2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * ((M_s2 * P2²) / (M_s1 * P1²))^(1/3)`\n\nWe are given:\n*   `R_s1 = R_s2` (same radii)\n*   `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` (Star 1 is twice as massive)\n*   `P1 = P2 / 3` (Planet 1's period is one-third of Planet 2's)\n\nThe following Python code will first simulate this scenario to find an approximate ratio, then calculate the exact value to verify the result and select the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_transit_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses Monte Carlo simulation and deterministic calculation to find the\n    ratio of transit probabilities for two exoplanets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- (a) Sampling / Monte Carlo Exploration ---\n    print(\"--- Monte Carlo Simulation ---\")\n    \n    # Set arbitrary base values for Planet 2's system\n    M_s2 = 1.0  # e.g., 1 solar mass\n    R_s2 = 1.0  # e.g., 1 solar radius\n    P2 = 3.0    # e.g., 3 years\n    \n    # Define Planet 1's system based on the given ratios\n    M_s1 = 2.0 * M_s2\n    R_s1 = 1.0 * R_s2\n    P1 = P2 / 3.0\n    \n    # From Kepler's Third Law, a is proportional to (M_s * P^2)^(1/3).\n    # The proportionality constant (G / 4*pi^2) will cancel in ratios.\n    # We introduce a scaling factor to make probabilities small and realistic.\n    scaling_factor = 100\n    a1 = scaling_factor * (M_s1 * P1**2)**(1/3)\n    a2 = scaling_factor * (M_s2 * P2**2)**(1/3)\n    \n    # Geometric transit probability p = R_star / a\n    prob1 = R_s1 / a1\n    prob2 = R_s2 / a2\n    \n    # Simulate a large number of randomly oriented systems\n    num_samples = 2_000_000\n    # For random inclinations, the probability of cos(i) being less than p is just p.\n    # We can simulate this by comparing a random number to the probability.\n    random_draws = np.random.rand(num_samples)\n    \n    transits1 = np.sum(random_draws < prob1)\n    transits2 = np.sum(random_draws < prob2)\n    \n    # Avoid division by zero if one count is zero\n    if transits1 == 0 or transits2 == 0:\n        simulated_ratio = float('nan')\n        print(\"Simulation resulted in zero transits for one or both planets.\")\n    else:\n        simulated_ratio = transits1 / transits2\n        print(f\"Simulated transits for Planet 1: {transits1}\")\n        print(f\"Simulated transits for Planet 2: {transits2}\")\n        print(f\"Simulated probability ratio (p1/p2): {simulated_ratio:.4f}\")\n\n    # --- (b) Narrowing Candidates ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Candidate Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"The simulation suggests Planet 1 is preferred by a factor of ~{simulated_ratio:.2f}.\")\n    print(\"This points towards option D.\")\n\n    # --- (c) Exact Checks ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Deterministic Verification ---\")\n    # The ratio of probabilities p1/p2 is:\n    # (R_s1 / R_s2) * ((M_s2 * P2^2) / (M_s1 * P1^2))^(1/3)\n    # With R_s1=R_s2, M_s1=2*M_s2, P1=P2/3:\n    # (1) * ((M_s2 * P2^2) / (2*M_s2 * (P2/3)^2))^(1/3)\n    # = ( (M_s2 * P2^2) / (2*M_s2 * P2^2 / 9) )^(1/3)\n    # = ( 1 / (2/9) )^(1/3)\n    # = (9/2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)\n    \n    exact_ratio = (4.5)**(1/3)\n    print(f\"The exact probability ratio (p1/p2) is (9/2)^(1/3) = {exact_ratio:.4f}\")\n\n    # --- (d) Final Answer ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"The exact calculation shows that Planet_1 has a {exact_ratio:.2f} times higher probability to transit than Planet_2.\")\n    print(\"This matches the result from the Monte Carlo simulation and corresponds to option D.\")\n    \n    final_answer = \"D\"\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Verified Answer: {final_answer}\")\n    return final_answer\n\n# Run the analysis\nsolve_transit_probability()\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
