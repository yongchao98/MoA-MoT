    """
    This function checks the correctness of the given answer to the exoplanet transit probability question.

    The core logic relies on two physics principles:
    1.  The geometric probability of transit (p) for a planet in a circular orbit is proportional to the stellar radius (R_s) divided by the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a).
        p ∝ R_s / a
    2.  Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (P), semi-major axis (a), and the host star's mass (M_s).
        P² ∝ a³ / M_s  or rearranged: a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)

    The goal is to calculate the ratio of probabilities, p1 / p2.
    """

    # From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:
    # R_s1 = R_s2  (Stellar radii are the same)
    # M_s1 = 2 * M_s2 (Star 1 is twice as massive as Star 2)
    # P1 = P2 / 3   (Planet 1's period is 1/3 of Planet 2's)

    # The ratio of probabilities p1 / p2 is given by:
    # p1 / p2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)
    # Since R_s1 = R_s2, the probability ratio simplifies to:
    # p1 / p2 = a2 / a1

    # We find the ratio a2 / a1 using Kepler's Third Law:
    # a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)
    # So, a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * P2²) / (M_s1 * P1²) ]^(1/3)

    # Substitute the known relationships into this equation:
    # a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * (3 * P1)²) / ((2 * M_s2) * P1²) ]^(1/3)
    # The M_s2 and P1² terms cancel out, leaving:
    # a2 / a1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)

    # Since p1 / p2 = a2 / a1, the final probability ratio is:
    probability_ratio = 4.5**(1/3)

    # The provided answer is D, which makes two claims:
    # 1. Planet_1 is preferred (meaning p1 > p2, or probability_ratio > 1).
    # 2. The factor is ~1.65.

    # Let's verify these claims.
    
    # Claim 1: Is Planet_1 preferred?
    is_p1_preferred = probability_ratio > 1
    if not is_p1_preferred:
        return (f"Incorrect. The calculated probability ratio p1/p2 is {probability_ratio:.4f}, "
                f"which is less than 1. This implies Planet_2 has a higher transit probability, "
                f"contradicting the claim in option D that Planet_1 is preferred.")

    # Claim 2: Is the ratio approximately 1.65?
    # We use math.isclose() for a robust floating-point comparison. A relative tolerance
    # of 1% is reasonable for the term "approximately".
    target_ratio_from_answer = 1.65
    is_ratio_correct = math.isclose(probability_ratio, target_ratio_from_answer, rel_tol=0.01)

    if not is_ratio_correct:
        return (f"Incorrect. While Planet_1 is correctly identified as being preferred, the calculated "
                f"probability ratio is {probability_ratio:.4f}. This value is not approximately 1.65 "
                f"as claimed in option D.")

    # If both claims from option D are verified by our calculation, the answer is correct.
