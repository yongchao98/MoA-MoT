    # Option A: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi

    }

    # Option B: The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame
    # This checks a fundamental principle of Cre-lox mediated fusions.
    # After Cre recombination, one lox site (the "scar") remains.

    # Option D: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing
    # The construct uses the CBA promoter. CBA (Chicken Î²-actin promoter/CMV enhancer) is a strong, ubiquitously active promoter that contains its own enhancer.
