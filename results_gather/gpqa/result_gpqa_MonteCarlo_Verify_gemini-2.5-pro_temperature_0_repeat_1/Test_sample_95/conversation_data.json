    "Here is the solution using the requested method.\n\nThe problem requires calculating the entropy of a supermassive black hole based on its angular size and distance. This involves a deterministic calculation using fundamental physics formulas. The \"randomized/Monte Carlo exploration\" is best interpreted as a preliminary, order-of-magnitude estimation to quickly identify the most likely candidate before performing a precise, deterministic verification.\n\n**1. Randomized/Monte Carlo Exploration (Order-of-Magnitude Estimate):**\n\n*   **Relate angular size to physical size:** The diameter of the event horizon `D` is related to the angular size `θ` and distance `d` by `D ≈ θ * d`.\n    *   `d` = 10¹⁰ pc ≈ 10¹⁰ * 3×10¹⁶ m = 3×10²⁶ m.\n    *   `θ` = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees ≈ 10⁻¹⁷ * (π/180) rad ≈ 10⁻¹⁷ * (1/60) rad ≈ 10⁻¹⁹ rad.\n    *   `D` ≈ (10⁻¹⁹ rad) * (3×10²⁶ m) ≈ 3×10⁷ m.\n*   **Find the event horizon area (A):** The radius is `Rs = D/2`, so `A = 4πRs² ≈ πD²`.\n    *   `A` ≈ 3 * (3×10⁷ m)² ≈ 3 * 9×10¹⁴ m² ≈ 3×10¹⁵ m².\n*   **Estimate the entropy (S):** The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is `S = (k_B * A) / (4 * l_P²)`, where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant and `l_P` is the Planck length.\n    *   `k_B` ≈ 10⁻²³ J/K.\n    *   The squared Planck length `l_P² = ħG/c³`.\n        *   `ħ` ≈ 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   `G` ≈ 7×10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg²\n        *   `c` ≈ 3×10⁸ m/s, so `c³` ≈ 27×10²⁴ ≈ 3×10²⁵ m³/s³\n        *   `l_P²` ≈ (10⁻³⁴ * 7×10⁻¹¹) / (3×10²⁵) ≈ 2×10⁻⁷⁰ m².\n    *   `S` ≈ (10⁻²³ J/K * 3×10¹⁵ m²) / (4 * 2×10⁻⁷⁰ m²) ≈ (3×10⁻⁸) / (8×10⁻⁷⁰) J/K ≈ 0.4×10⁶² J/K.\n\nThis rough estimation points to an order of magnitude of 10⁶¹ or 10⁶², making option **C) 10⁶² J/K** the most plausible candidate.\n\n**2.
