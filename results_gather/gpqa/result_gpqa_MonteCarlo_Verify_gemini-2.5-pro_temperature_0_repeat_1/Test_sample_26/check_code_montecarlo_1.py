    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the biological riddle about protein synthesis and transport.

    The riddle describes co-translational translocation of a protein into the secretory pathway.
    - "ribonucleoprotein particle": Signal Recognition Particle (SRP).
    - "nascent chain": A new polypeptide being made on a ribosome.
    - "Pause": SRP binding halts translation.
    - "show you in... somewhat rough": SRP targets the complex to the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER).
    - "need some sugar": Glycosylation, which starts in the RER.
    - "on my way": The protein is entering the secretory pathway for transport.
