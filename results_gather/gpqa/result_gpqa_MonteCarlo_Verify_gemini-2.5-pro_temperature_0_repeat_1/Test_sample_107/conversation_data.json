    "Answering this question requires comparing the energy from the paramagnetic Zeeman effect with the energy of an atomic transition.\n\n1.  **Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\langle H \\rangle$)**: This is the energy shift caused by an external magnetic field, given by the formula $\\langle H \\rangle = m \\mu_B B$, where $m$ is the magnetic quantum number, $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, and $B$ is the magnetic field strength.\n2.  **Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**: This is the energy of a photon involved in an atomic transition, given by $\\Delta E = hc/\\lambda$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\lambda$ is the photon's wavelength.\n\nThe problem is deterministic, but to satisfy the \"randomized/Monte Carlo exploration\" requirement, we can randomly sample different \"small values of m\" (e.g., 1, 2, 3) to confirm that the resulting relationship holds true and is not dependent on a specific choice.
