    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by recalculating the physical quantities.

    The question compares the paramagnetic coupling term <H> with a transition
    energy Delta E for a Hydrogen atom.

    Given:
    - Magnetic field B = 1 T
    - Orbital magnetic quantum number 'm' is small
    - Transition wavelength lambda = 0.4861 * 10^-6 m

    Formulas:
    - Transition Energy: Delta E = h * c / lambda
    - Paramagnetic Coupling Energy: <H> = m * mu_B * B (Zeeman effect)
