    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the stellar photosphere problem.

    The code calculates the factor by which the population ratio of two atomic
    energy levels changes when a star's effective temperature drops from 6000 K
    to 5500 K. It uses the Boltzmann equation and the energy derived from the
    given transition wavelength.
