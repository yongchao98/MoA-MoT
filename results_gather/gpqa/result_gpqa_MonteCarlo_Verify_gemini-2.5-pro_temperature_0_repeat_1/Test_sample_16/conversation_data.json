    "Answering this question involves determining the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex. The process can be modeled with an equilibrium calculation, which can be explored through sampling and then verified with a precise deterministic calculation.\n\n1.  **Reaction and Equilibrium Constant**: The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n    The formation constant ($K_f$) is given for the reverse reaction:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Concentrations**: Let the initial concentration of the complex be $C = 0.02$ M. At equilibrium, a small amount, $x$, will dissociate.\n    *   $[Ca^{2+}] = x$\n    *   $[EDTA^{4-}] = x$\n    *   $[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}] = C - x = 0.02 - x$\n\n3.  **Equation Setup**: Substituting these into the equilibrium expression gives:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\nThis equation can be solved for $x$, which represents the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport random\n\ndef solve_ca_concentration():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses randomized exploration and deterministic verification to find the\n    concentration of calcium ions in a Ca-EDTA solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Problem parameters\n    C_complex_initial = 0.02  # M\n    Kf = 5e10\n    options = {\n        \"A\": 6.3e-7,\n        \"B\": 5.0e-3,\n        \"C\": 1.0e-2,\n        \"D\": 2.0e-2,\n    }\n\n    # (a) Sample and (b) Narrow Candidates (Monte Carlo Exploration)\n    print(\"--- Monte Carlo Exploration ---\")\n    print(\"Testing the provided options by calculating the reaction quotient (Q).\")\n    \n    best_candidate = None\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n\n    # Shuffle the options to simulate random sampling\n    shuffled_keys = list(options.keys())\n    random.shuffle(shuffled_keys)\n\n    for key in shuffled_keys:\n        x = options[key]\n        # The approximation C - x ≈ C is valid for small x\n        # but we use C - x for better accuracy.\n        if x >= C_complex_initial:\n            q_val = float('inf') # Dissociation cannot exceed initial amount\n        else:\n            q_val = (C_complex_initial - x) / (x**2)\n        \n        diff = abs(math.log10(q_val) - math.log10(Kf))\n        print(f\"Testing option {key} ({x:.2e} M): Calculated Q = {q_val:.2e}.
