    # --- Problem Parameters ---
    # Initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex
    C_complex_initial = 0.02  # M
    # Formation constant (Kf)
    Kf = 5e10

    # --- Provided Answer ---
    # The question asks for the concentration of calcium ions.
    # The LLM's answer is A, which corresponds to 6.3x10^-7 M.

    # --- Calculation ---
    # The equilibrium expression leads to the quadratic equation:
    # Kf * x^2 + x - C_complex_initial = 0
    # where x is the concentration of Ca^2+ ions.
    
    # Coefficients for the quadratic formula (ax^2 + bx + c = 0)
    a = Kf
    b = 1
    c = -C_complex_initial

    discriminant = b**2 - 4 * a * c

    # A relative tolerance of 2% is reasonable for this type of problem.
