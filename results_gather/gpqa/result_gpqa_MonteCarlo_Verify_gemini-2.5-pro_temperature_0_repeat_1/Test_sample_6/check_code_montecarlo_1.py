def check_annihilation_energy():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the gamma-ray annihilation problem.
    
    The problem asks for the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray (E_gamma)
    that can annihilate with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon (E_cmb)
    to produce an electron-positron pair.
    
    The threshold condition for this process, gamma + gamma_cmb -> e+ + e-,
    is derived from the conservation of four-momentum. For a head-on collision,
    which provides the lowest energy threshold, the invariant mass squared (s) gives:
    s = (2 * m_e * c^2)^2 = 4 * E_gamma * E_cmb
    where m_e*c^2 is the rest mass energy of an electron.
    
    This simplifies to the formula used for calculation:
    E_gamma = (m_e * c^2)^2 / E_cmb
