    "This problem asks for the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) that can annihilate with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$). The reaction is $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$.\n\nThe threshold energy corresponds to the minimum energy required for this reaction to be kinematically possible. This occurs when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is equal to the rest mass energy of the products, which are an electron and a positron. For the most efficient energy transfer, we consider a head-on collision.\n\nThe core physical principle is the invariance of the square of the total four-momentum ($s = P_{tot}^2$). We can calculate this value in both the lab frame and the center-of-mass frame and equate them.\n\n1.  **In the Center-of-Mass (CM) Frame:** At the threshold, the electron and positron are created at rest. The total energy is the sum of their rest mass energies, $E_{CM} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$. The total momentum is zero. The invariant square of the four-momentum is $s = (E_{CM})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n2.  **In the Lab Frame:** Let the high-energy gamma-ray have energy $E_{\\gamma}$ and the CMB photon have energy $E_{CMB}$. For a head-on collision (the most energy-efficient case, yielding the lowest threshold for $E_{\\gamma}$), the photons travel in opposite directions. The invariant square of the four-momentum is $s = 4 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB}$.\n\n3.  **Equating and Solving:**\n    $(2m_e c^2)^2 = 4 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB}$\n    $4(m_e c^2)^2 = 4 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB}$\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nWe are given:\n- Average CMB photon energy, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3}$ eV.\n- The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511$ MeV = $0.511 \\times 10^6$ eV.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation gives the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray. The following Python code implements a Monte Carlo exploration by sampling various collision angles to find the minimum energy, then verifies it with the exact analytical formula derived above.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_gamma_ray_threshold():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses randomized sampling and deterministic calculation to find the gamma-ray energy threshold\n    for pair production with CMB photons.\n    \"\"\"\n    # (a) Sample: Monte Carlo Exploration\n    # Define physical constants\n    m_e_eV = 0.511e6  # Electron rest mass energy in eV\n    E_cmb_eV = 1e-3   # Average CMB photon energy in eV\n\n    # The threshold energy depends on the collision angle theta.
