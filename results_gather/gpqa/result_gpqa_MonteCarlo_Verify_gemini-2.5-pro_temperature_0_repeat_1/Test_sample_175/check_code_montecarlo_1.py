    This function checks the correctness of the given answer to a quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem involves a sequence of two measurements on a quantum system.
    1.  The initial state and operators P and Q are defined.
    2.  The initial state is normalized.
    3.  The probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 for operator P is calculated.
    4.  The state of the system collapses to the eigenvector corresponding to the measured eigenvalue.
    5.  The probability of measuring eigenvalue -1 for operator Q in the new state is calculated.
    6.  The total probability for the sequence of measurements is the product of the individual probabilities.
    7.  This calculated probability is compared with the provided answer's value.
