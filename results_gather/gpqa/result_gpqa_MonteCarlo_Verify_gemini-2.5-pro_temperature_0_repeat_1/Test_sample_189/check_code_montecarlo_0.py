    # Determine the correct order based on chemical principles:
    # 1. Charge: Anions > Neutral. So, Methanol (4) is the weakest.
    # 2. Atom (in protic solvent): Nucleophilicity increases down a group (S > O). So, Ethanethiolate (5) is the strongest.
    # 3. Resonance: Localized charge > Delocalized charge. Propionate (3) is resonance-stabilized, making it weaker than Hydroxide (2) and 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1).
    # 4. Sterics: Less hindered > More hindered. Hydroxide (2) is much smaller than the bulky 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1), making (2) more reactive than (1).
    #
    # Combining these rules gives the order:
    # Strongest -> 5 (Ethanethiolate)
    # Next -> 2 (Hydroxide)
