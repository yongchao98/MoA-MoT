    "This problem can be solved by calculating the volume integral of the divergence of the given vector field. The vector field is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction. The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\nA naive Monte Carlo simulation for the volume integral `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV` would involve sampling many points within the sphere and averaging the value of the divergence `∇ ⋅ f`. For any point not at the origin (r > 0), the divergence of this field is zero. Since random sampling in a continuous volume will almost never hit the exact point `r=0`, this method would incorrectly suggest the integral is 0.\n\nA more robust method is required due to the singularity at the origin. The Divergence Theorem provides the correct analytical solution.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses randomized exploration to propose an answer, then deterministically verifies it.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- (a) Randomized/Monte Carlo Sampling ---\n    # We attempt a naive Monte Carlo estimation of the volume integral: ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV.\n    # The integrand is the divergence of the field f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat.\n    # Analytically, for r > 0, the divergence ∇ ⋅ f is 0.\n    # At r=0, the field is singular.
