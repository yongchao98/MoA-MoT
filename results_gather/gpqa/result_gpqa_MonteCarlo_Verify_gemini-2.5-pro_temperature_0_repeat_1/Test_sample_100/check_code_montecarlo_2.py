    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # Reaction: 3-methylpyrrolidine + A --(B)--> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine
    # Reactant 1: 3-methylpyrrolidine (a secondary amine)
    # Product: 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine (an enamine)
    # This is an enamine synthesis reaction.

    # --- Chemical Knowledge Base ---
    # 1. Enamine synthesis requires a secondary amine and an aldehyde/ketone.
    # 2. The reaction is acid-catalyzed.
    # 3. The structure of the enamine product reveals the starting carbonyl compound.
    #    Hydrolysis of the product yields 3-methylpyrrolidine and cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
    #    Therefore, Reagent A must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
    required_reagent_A = "cyclohexanecarbaldehyde"
    
    # 4. The catalyst B must be an acid.
    acid_catalysts = ["Acetic acid", "TsOH"]
