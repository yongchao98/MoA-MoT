def check_relativity_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the relativity problem.

    The solution involves these steps:
    1.  Define all known constants from the problem and external sources.
    2.  Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) based on the spacecraft's velocity.
    3.  Calculate the travel time as measured by an observer on Earth (or in the LMC's rest frame).
    4.  Use the Lorentz factor to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) due to time dilation.
    5.  Check if the astronaut survives the journey by comparing the travel time to their remaining lifespan.
    6.  If the astronaut survives, determine which of the numerical options is closest to the calculated travel time.
    7.  Compare this derived correct answer with the provided answer.
