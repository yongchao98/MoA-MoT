    Checks the correctness of the proposed synthesis route for 
    1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.

    The code assumes the intended product is the self-aldol product of 
    cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, as the IUPAC name is chemically impossible.

    # --- Analysis of each option ---

    def check_option_A():
        # Pathway: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O
        # Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane -> 1-cyclohexylpropyne. (Correct)
        # Step 2: H2/Pd is a full reduction. 1-cyclohexylpropyne -> propylcyclohexane (an alkane). (Correct reaction)
        # Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O is alkyne hydration. This reaction fails on an alkane.
        # The reagent order is incorrect.
        return "Incorrect. Step 2 (H2/Pd) fully reduces the alkyne to an alkane (propylcyclohexane). The subsequent alkyne hydration in Step 4 (H2SO4, HgSO4) cannot occur on an alkane."

    def check_option_B():
        # Pathway: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2
        # Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane -> 1-cyclohexylpropyne. (Correct alkylation)
        # Step 2: H2/Pd-CaCO3 (Lindlar's catalyst) reduces the alkyne to a cis-alkene. (Correct partial reduction)
        # Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S is reductive ozonolysis, cleaving the alkene to form aldehydes.
        # This correctly produces cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (and acetaldehyde).
        # Step 4: Ba(OH)2 is a base that catalyzes the aldol condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
        # This step correctly forms the target aldol product.
        # This pathway is chemically sound.
        return "Correct"

    def check_option_C():
        # Pathway: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH
        # Step 1: NaNH2 is a very strong base. Methanol is a protic solvent (a weak acid).
        # The NaNH2 will be instantly quenched by methanol in an acid-base reaction,
        # regenerating the starting alkyne if it was deprotonated. This step is futile.
        return "Incorrect. Step 1 is a futile acid-base reaction. The strong base (NaNH2) is neutralized by the protic solvent (methanol), preventing the desired alkylation reaction."

    def check_option_D():
        # Pathway: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH
        # Step 1: Alkylation to form 1-cyclohexylbut-1-yne. (Correct)
        # Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 reduces the alkyne to a trans-alkene. (Correct)
        # Step 3: O3/H2O is ozonolysis with an *oxidative* workup. This produces carboxylic acids,
        # not the aldehydes needed for the subsequent aldol reaction.
        # It would yield cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, not cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
        return "Incorrect. Step 3 uses an oxidative workup (O3/H2O) for ozonolysis, which produces carboxylic acids. The required intermediate for the final aldol step is an aldehyde (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde)."
