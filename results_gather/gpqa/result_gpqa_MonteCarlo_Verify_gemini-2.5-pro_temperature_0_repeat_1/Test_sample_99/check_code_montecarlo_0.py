    # F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are precursors for azo dyes. This is a known chemical fact.

    # --- Statement C Check ---
    # "D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra."
    # D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene). Due to its high symmetry, it has two sets of equivalent protons:
    # 1. The 3 aromatic protons are equivalent -> 1 singlet.
    # 2. The 9 methyl protons are equivalent -> 1 singlet.
    # Total = 2 singlets.

    # --- Statement D Check ---
    # "H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution."
    # H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test gives a characteristic violet/purple color for most phenols.
    # However, phenols with bulky groups at both ortho positions (like H) are sterically hindered and give a NEGATIVE test.
    # A negative test means no color change occurs; the solution remains the yellow color of the FeCl3 reagent.
    # Describing a negative test by the reagent's color is misleading and chemically incorrect in this context.
    # The compound does not "give" a yellow color; it fails to give the expected violet color.

                f"- Statement C (Mesitylene NMR): Correct. High symmetry leads to 2 singlets.\n"
                f"- Statement D (FeCl3 test on hindered phenol): Incorrect. 2,4,6-trimethylphenol is sterically hindered and gives a negative FeCl3 test (no violet color). Stating it 'gives a yellow color' (the color of the reagent) is a misleading description of a negative result.")
