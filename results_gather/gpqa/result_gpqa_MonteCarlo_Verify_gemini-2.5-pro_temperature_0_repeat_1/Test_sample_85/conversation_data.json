    "This problem requires understanding the selectivity of two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester. The stereochemistry of the starting material directly determines the stereochemistry of the product, as the reactions do not affect the chiral center.\n\n1.  **Reaction 1:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    *   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:** LiBH4 will reduce the isobutoxy ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains. The subsequent acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the newly formed alcohol and the existing carboxylic acid to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The chiral center at C3 of the starting acid (which becomes C4 in the lactone product) is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, its configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    *   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3) is a strong reducing agent with a high affinity for carboxylic acids, reducing them to primary alcohols.\n    *   **Mechanism:** BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains. The subsequent acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification, where the new alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl to form the lactone ring, eliminating isobutanol.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center is not affected. Its configuration is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nBased on this deterministic analysis, A must be the (R) enantiomer and B must be the (S) enantiomer. This corresponds to option C. The following Python code simulates this verification process by sampling the options and applying these chemical rules.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses randomized exploration and deterministic verification to solve the stereochemistry problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the four options based on the stereochemistry of starting materials A and B.\n    # A = (S)-acid, B = (S)-acid\n    # B = (R)-acid, B = (R)-acid\n    # C = (R)-acid, B = (S)-acid\n    # D = (S)-acid, B = (R)-acid\n    options = {\n        \"A\": {\"A_config\": \"S\", \"B_config\": \"S\"},\n        \"B\": {\"A_config\": \"R\", \"B_config\": \"R\"},\n        \"C\": {\"A_config\": \"R\", \"B_config\": \"S\"},\n        \"D\": {\"A_config\": \"S\", \"B_config\": \"R\"},\n    }\n\n    # (a) Sample: Create a randomized order to check the candidates.\n    candidate_keys = list(options.keys())\n    random.shuffle(candidate_keys)\n    print(f\"Randomized exploration order: {candidate_keys}\\n\")\n\n    verified_answer = None\n\n    # (b) Narrow candidates & (c) Run exact checks\n    for key in candidate_keys:\n        candidate = options[key]\n        a_config = candidate[\"A_config\"]\n        b_config = candidate[\"B_config\"]\n        \n        print(f\"--- Checking candidate {key}: A is ({a_config}), B is ({b_config}) ---\")\n\n        # Check 1: A + LiBH4 -> (R)-lactone\n        # LiBH4 reduces the ester.
