    # --- Chemical Principles ---
    # Reaction 1 (Cyanohydrin formation):
    # This reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (from NaCN) to a ketone (butan-2-one).
    # The resulting intermediate is an alkoxide ion, which must be protonated to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH).
    # Reagent A must be a proton source. A common and appropriate method is an acidic workup, represented by H3O+.
    # NaHSO3 is incorrect; it forms bisulfite adducts, which is a different reversible reaction and does not lead to the desired cyanohydrin product.
    correct_reagent_A = "H3O+"
    incorrect_reagent_A = "NaHSO3"

    # Reaction 2 (Nitrile hydrolysis):
    # This reaction converts a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).
    # This transformation requires harsh conditions, typically heating with a strong acid or a strong base.
    # Reagent B, used with water, acts as the catalyst. A strong acid like HCl is a standard choice for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.
    # A weak acid like acetic acid (CH3COOH) is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze this hydrolysis.
