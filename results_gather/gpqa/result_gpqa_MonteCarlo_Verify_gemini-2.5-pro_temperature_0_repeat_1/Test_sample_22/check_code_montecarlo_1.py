    # --- Step 1: Define the expected products based on the reaction mechanism ---

    # The reaction is an intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution (a type of
    # Friedel-Crafts alkylation) initiated by the protonation of the alkene.

    # Mechanism:
    # 1. H+ from HBr adds to the alkene double bond according to Markovnikov's rule,
    #    forming a secondary carbocation: Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH(+)-CH3.
    # 2. This carbocation can undergo two competing reactions, leading to two products.

    # Pathway A: Direct intramolecular cyclization. The benzene ring attacks the
    # secondary carbocation to form a 6-membered ring.
    expected_product_1 = "3,3,4-trimethylchromane"

    # Pathway B: The secondary carbocation rearranges via a 1,2-methyl shift to a more
    # stable tertiary carbocation: Ph-O-CH2-C(+)(CH3)-CH(CH3)2.
    # The benzene ring then attacks this tertiary carbocation to form a 5-membered ring.
