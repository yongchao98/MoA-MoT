    # --- Mechanistic Derivation of Expected Products ---

    # The reaction of an aryl alkyl ether with an alkene and HBr proceeds via
    # electrophilic addition to the alkene, followed by potential carbocation
    # rearrangements and intramolecular cyclization.

    # Step 1: Protonation of the alkene (Ph-O-CH2-C(Me)2-CH=CH2)
    # Following Markovnikov's rule, H+ adds to the terminal CH2, forming a 
    # more stable secondary carbocation.
    # Intermediate 1 (Secondary Carbocation): Ph-O-CH2-C(Me)2-CH(+)-CH3

    # Step 2: Competing pathways from Intermediate 1.
    
    # Pathway A: Direct intramolecular cyclization (Intramolecular Friedel-Crafts).
    # The electron-rich benzene ring attacks the secondary carbocation.
    # This forms a 6-membered ring.

    # Pathway B: Rearrangement followed by cyclization.
    # A 1,2-methyl shift occurs to form a more stable tertiary carbocation.

    # The benzene ring then attacks this tertiary carbocation.
