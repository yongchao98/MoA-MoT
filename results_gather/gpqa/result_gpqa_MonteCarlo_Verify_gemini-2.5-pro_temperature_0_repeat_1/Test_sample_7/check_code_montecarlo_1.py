    # 1. G2 is the upstream master regulator (TF).
    # 2. G1 and G3 act redundantly in a parallel pathway.
    # Although its third clause ("G1 is epistatic towards G3") is incorrect, it is the most accurate description among all the choices. The provided LLM answer and its reasoning for selecting 'B' as the best-fit option are sound.
