    # Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2.
    radius_ratio = 1.5  # R1 / R2

    # The wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same.
    # According to Wien's Displacement Law (lambda_max * T = constant),
    # if the peak wavelength (lambda_max) is the same for both stars,
    # their surface temperatures (T) must also be the same.
    temperature_ratio = 1.0  # T1 / T2

    # The mass ratio and radial velocities are irrelevant information (distractors)
    # for calculating luminosity based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which depends
    # only on radius and temperature.

    # --- Physics Calculation ---
    # The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the
    # Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4 * pi * R^2 * sigma * T^4.
    # To find the ratio of luminosities (L1 / L2), we can write:
    # L1 / L2 = (4 * pi * R1^2 * sigma * T1^4) / (4 * pi * R2^2 * sigma * T2^4)
    # The constants (4, pi, sigma) cancel out, leaving:
    # L1 / L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4)
    # L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4
