    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the Diels-Alder reaction.
    The check proceeds in three steps:
    1. Verify the basic chemical structure (the type of bridge atom).
    2. Verify the stereochemical principle (thermodynamic control favoring the EXO product).
    3. Computationally verify the geometric classification of EXO vs. ENDO to confirm the logic.

    # --- Constraint 1: Bridge Atom ---
    # The diene is 2,5-dimethylthiophene. The heteroatom in the diene's ring (Sulfur) forms the bridge.
    # Therefore, the product name must contain "epithio" (sulfur bridge).
    if "epoxy" in options[llm_answer]:
        return f"Incorrect. The provided answer {llm_answer} describes a product with an 'epoxy' (oxygen) bridge. The diene is 2,5-dimethylthiophene, so the reaction must form an 'epithio' (sulfur) bridge, eliminating options C and D."

    # --- Constraint 2: Stereochemistry (EXO vs. ENDO) ---
    # The reaction condition "Heat" implies thermodynamic control.
    # In Diels-Alder reactions, the EXO adduct is sterically less hindered and thus thermodynamically more stable than the ENDO adduct.
    # The question correctly asks for the EXO product, and the LLM's reasoning identifies this principle.

    # --- Constraint 3: Linking IUPAC Name to Geometry ---
    # The core of the problem is determining which option, A or B, represents the EXO adduct.
    # The LLM's answer asserts that B is the EXO adduct based on its IUPAC name.
    # We will verify this logic using a computational model, as done in the LLM's own reasoning.
