    # 1. Determine the correct product for Reaction A
    # The most acidic proton in methyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate is at C1 (alpha to both carbonyls).
    # Therefore, the Michael addition must occur at C1.
    # The correct product name must reflect C1 substitution.

    # The reaction is a Michael addition of the enolate of ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate to the acceptor.
