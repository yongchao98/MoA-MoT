    This function checks the correctness of the proposed product for the aza-Cope rearrangement of
    (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene.

    It verifies two main constraints:
    1. The product must have the correct functional groups (one imine, one alkene).
    2. The product must be the correct constitutional isomer, which is determined by the specific
       bond shifts in the [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.
