    "Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene + Maleic Anhydride → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Upon heating, cyclooctatetraene (which normally exists in a non-planar \"tub\" conformation) undergoes a valence tautomerization to form its reactive isomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This isomer contains a conjugated diene system (a cyclohexadiene ring) that can react with a dienophile.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Maleic anhydride is a potent dienophile. The Diels-Alder reaction is stereoselective and typically proceeds via an *endo* transition state due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. This means the anhydride ring in Product 1 will be oriented *endo* relative to the newly formed bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene framework. This is the major kinetic product.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + Methanol/H₂SO₄ → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Acid-catalyzed esterification.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The acid catalyst protonates the anhydride, which is then opened by a nucleophilic attack from methanol. Since the reaction is heated in an excess of methanol with an acid catalyst, the resulting carboxylic acid group is also converted to a methyl ester (Fischer esterification).\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction opens the anhydride ring but does not change the stereocenters of the carbon skeleton. The two new methyl ester groups (-COOCH₃) will have a *cis* relationship, preserving the stereochemistry of the original *endo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + Cyclopentadiene → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** A second Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Product 2 acts as the dienophile, and cyclopentadiene is the diene. Product 2 has two double bonds, but the one in the strained cyclobutene ring is more reactive and sterically accessible for the Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction has two key stereochemical aspects:\n        *   **Face Selectivity:** Cyclopentadiene will attack the cyclobutene double bond from the face that is less sterically hindered. The bulky ester groups are on the *endo* face of the main cage, so the attack will occur from the opposite, *exo* face.\n        *   ***Endo/Exo* Selectivity:** Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclopentadiene as the diene have a strong electronic preference for the *endo* adduct, where the developing double bond of the diene is positioned under the substituents of the dienophile. Although the dienophile is bulky, this strong electronic preference for the *endo* pathway is expected to dominate, making the *endo* adduct the major kinetic product.\n\n### Conclusion from Analysis\n\nThe major isomer (Product 3) is the result of two consecutive kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   The first reaction gives the **endo** adduct.\n*   The second reaction also gives the **endo** adduct.\nTherefore, the final product is the **(endo, endo)** stereoisomer.\n\n### Randomized/Monte Carlo Exploration & Deterministic Verification\n\nThe Python code below formalizes this reasoning. It first uses chemical principles to sample the most likely stereochemical pathway (*endo* for both reactions). Then, it deterministically verifies this prediction by mapping the four possible stereoisomers to the given options based on analysis of their SMILES strings. The code confirms that the (endo, endo) isomer corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cycloaddition_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a multi-step synthesis problem involving two Diels-Alder reactions.\n\n    The method uses a Monte Carlo-style exploration by considering the probabilities\n    of different stereochemical outcomes and then deterministically verifies the\n    most likely product against the given options.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- (a) Sampling and Candidate Generation ---\n    # The reaction sequence involves two Diels-Alder (DA) reactions.
