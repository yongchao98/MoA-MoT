    The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2],
    among all cobalt-containing species in a solution.
    
    The fraction of a specific complex, α_n, is given by the formula:
    α_n = (β_n * [L]^n) / (1 + Σ(β_i * [L]^i))
    where L is the ligand (SCN-), β_n is the overall stability constant for the n-th complex,
    and the sum is over all formed complexes (i=1 to 4). β_0 is defined as 1.
    
    The total cobalt concentration (10^-2 M) is much smaller than the ligand concentration (0.1 M),
    so we can assume the free ligand concentration [SCN-] is approximately constant at 0.1 M.
    The total cobalt concentration itself is not needed to calculate the relative percentage of a species.
