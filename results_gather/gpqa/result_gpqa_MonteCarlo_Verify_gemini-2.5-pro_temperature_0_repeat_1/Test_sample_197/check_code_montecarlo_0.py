    # The total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M is much smaller than the total thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M.

    # The fraction of any given complex [Co(SCN)n] (α_n) is given by the formula:
    # α_n = (β_n * [L]^n) / (1 + Σ(β_i * [L]^i)) for i from 1 to 4.
    # We need to find the percentage for the n=2 species, [Co(SCN)2].

    # Calculate the denominator of the fraction formula (often called the complex formation function, Φ)
    # Φ = 1 + β1*[L]^1 + β2*[L]^2 + β3*[L]^3 + β4*[L]^4
    denominator = 1 + (beta1 * L**1) + (beta2 * L**2) + (beta3 * L**3) + (beta4 * L**4)
