    "Answering this question requires analyzing the three-dimensional structure of each molecule to determine if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A molecule's chirality is the basis for optical isomerism.\n\nThe process will follow the requested format:\n(a) **Sampling/Exploration**: We will conceptually explore each molecule's structure, looking for potential sources of chirality, such as asymmetric carbon atoms or axial chirality (as in hindered biphenyls). This is our \"randomized\" or heuristic first pass.\n(b) **Narrowing Candidates**: Based on the initial exploration, we will identify molecules that are likely to be chiral.\n(c) **Exact Checks**: We will apply deterministic rules of stereochemistry to verify chirality. This includes using RDKit, a cheminformatics library, to identify chiral centers and applying established rules for other forms of chirality like atropisomerism.\n(d) **Final Answer**: The code will print the analysis and the verified final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef analyze_and_verify_chirality():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses a conceptual exploration to propose likely candidates for optical isomerism,\n    then deterministically verifies them using chemical rules and the RDKit library.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Attempt to import RDKit, a required library for chemical analysis.\n    try:\n        from rdkit import Chem\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"This script requires the RDKit library.\")\n        print(\"Please install it using: pip install rdkit-pypi\")\n        # If RDKit is not available, we can't run the verification and must exit.\n        # A fallback to pure theory would be possible but violates the coding rule.\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    # --- Data Definition ---\n    # Define the four compounds with their names and SMILES strings for programmatic analysis.\n    compounds = {\n        \"1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\": {\n            \"smiles\": \"COC(=O)c1c(N(=O)=O)cccc1-c1c(C(=O)OC)c(N(=O)=O)cccc1\",\n            \"is_chiral\": None,\n            \"reason\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\": {\n            \"smiles\": \"CC(O)C(=O)OC\",  # Also known as methyl lactate\n            \"is_chiral\": None,\n            \"reason\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"3. benzophenone\": {\n            \"smiles\": \"O=C(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1\",\n            \"is_chiral\": None,\n            \"reason\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"4. dimethyl fumarate\": {\n            \"smiles\": \"COC(=O)/C=C/C(=O)OC\",  # The /C=C/ notation specifies trans geometry\n            \"is_chiral\": None,\n            \"reason\": \"\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- (a) Sampling & (b) Narrowing Candidates ---\")\n    print(\"Exploring molecular structures for potential sources of chirality...\")\n    print(\"Candidates for chirality are those with asymmetric carbons or restricted bond rotation (atropisomerism).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- (c) Running Exact Checks (Deterministic Verification) ---\")\n\n    # Compound 1: Check for atropisomerism (a form of axial chirality)\n    name1 = \"1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\"\n    # Deterministic Rule: Biphenyls with three or more large substituents at the ortho-positions\n    # (2, 2', 6, 6') have hindered rotation and are chiral if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically.\n    # This molecule has bulky groups at all four ortho positions.\n    compounds[name1][\"is_chiral\"] = True\n    compounds[name1][\"reason\"] = \"This is a substituted biphenyl.
