    # This is a classic case of atropisomerism. Chirality arises from restricted rotation
    # around the biphenyl single bond due to bulky ortho substituents, and each ring
    # being asymmetrically substituted.
    # - Bulky groups at all four ortho positions: Yes (-NO2 and -COOCH3).

    # Conclusion: The molecule is chiral.
