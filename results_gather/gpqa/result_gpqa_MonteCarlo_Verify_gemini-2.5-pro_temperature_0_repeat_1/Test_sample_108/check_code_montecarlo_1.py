def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the given answer for the nuclear physics problem.

    The problem asks to identify which of the four given transitions is not permitted
    based on three rules:
    1. Pauli Principle for the final NN state: T(NN) + S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd.
       Given T(NN)=0, this simplifies to S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd.
    2. Conservation of Angular Momentum: The total angular momentum of the initial
       state (J_i) must equal the vector sum of the final state's angular momenta
       (J_f and l_X). Since J_i=0, this requires J_f = l_X.
    3. Conservation of Parity: The parity of the initial state must equal the
       parity of the final state. P_i = P_f.
       P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1.
       P_f = P_NN(final) * P_X(intrinsic) * P_X(orbital)
           = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1).
       So, +1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1), which means L_f + l_X must be odd.
