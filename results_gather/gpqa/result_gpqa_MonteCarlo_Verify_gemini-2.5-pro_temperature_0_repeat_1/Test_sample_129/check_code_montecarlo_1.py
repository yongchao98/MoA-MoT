def check_quasar_redshift_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the quasar redshift problem.

    The problem asks for the lower limit on the redshift (z) for the Lyman-alpha
    absorption line to be detectable by ground-based optical telescopes.

    1.  Identify the rest wavelength (Lyman-alpha): λ_rest = 1216 Å.
    2.  Identify the constraint: The minimum observable wavelength from the ground
        due to atmospheric cutoff is ~3500 Å. This is λ_observed_min.
    3.  Use the redshift formula: z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1.
    4.  Calculate the minimum z required to meet the constraint.
    5.  Compare the calculated z with the given options to find the best fit.
