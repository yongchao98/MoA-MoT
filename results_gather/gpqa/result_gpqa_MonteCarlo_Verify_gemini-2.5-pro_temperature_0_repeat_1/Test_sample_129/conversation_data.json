    "The core of this problem is determining the minimum redshift `z` required to shift the Lyman-alpha spectral line from its rest wavelength in the far-ultraviolet (UV) into the optical window observable by ground-based telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to ozone, absorbs most UV radiation below a certain wavelength.\n\nThe redshift `z` is related to the rest wavelength (`λ_rest`) and observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) by the formula:\n`λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z)`\n\nTo find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we need to find the `z` that shifts the Lyman-alpha line (`λ_rest` ≈ 1216 Å) to the very beginning of the atmospheric optical window (`λ_obs_min`). The exact value for this atmospheric cutoff can vary, but it is generally considered to be in the range of 3200 Å to 3800 Å. We can use randomized exploration within this plausible range to see which answer is most robust.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_redshift_limit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses randomized exploration and deterministic verification to find the minimum\n    redshift for observing Lyman-alpha from the ground.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- (a) Sampling / Monte Carlo Exploration ---\n    # The key unknown is the precise lower wavelength limit for a \"ground-based optical telescope\".\n    # The atmosphere's transparency drops sharply below ~4000 Angstroms.

    "Excellent, the randomized exploration and deterministic verification both converged on the same conclusion. The Monte Carlo sampling of plausible atmospheric cutoff wavelengths produced an average minimum redshift of `z ≈ 1.86`. The deterministic check, using a standard cutoff of 3500 Å, yielded `z ≈ 1.88`. Both results strongly support option B as the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
