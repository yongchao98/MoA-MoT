    This function verifies the correctness of the given answer by performing the required quantum mechanics calculations.

    The problem involves:

    2. Defining the operator A.
    3. Finding the eigenvalues and eigenstates of A.
    4. Calculating the probability of measuring the system in each eigenstate.
    5. Calculating the expectation (average) value of A.
