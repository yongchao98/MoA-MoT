    This function checks the correctness of the given answer to the quantum mechanics problem.
    
    The problem involves:
    1. A state |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.
    2. An operator A with matrix elements Aij = hbar/2 for i!=j and 0 for i=j.
    
    The tasks are to calculate:
    1. The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A.
    2. The average (expectation) value of A.
    
    The provided answer (A) is:
    - Probabilities: 0.64, 0.36
