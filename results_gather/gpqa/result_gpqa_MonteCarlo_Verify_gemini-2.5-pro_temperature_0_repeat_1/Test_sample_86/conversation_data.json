    "Answering this question involves a two-step process: first, deducing the chemical structure from the given information, and second, predicting the 1H NMR spectrum for that structure and matching it to the provided options.\n\n### Step 1: Deducing the Structure\n\n1.  **Carbon Count & Core Structure:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms and a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons (C6). Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons (8 - 6 = 2).\n2.  **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n3.  **Assembling the Pieces:**\n    *   One substituent is the halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable arrangement for a C2H3O group attached to a benzene ring is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   This gives us a **haloacetophenone** molecule with the general structure **X-C6H4-COCH3**.\n4.  **Isomers:** The two substituents can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions. The para (1,4) isomer is highly symmetric and gives a simple, characteristic NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 2: Predicting the 1H NMR and Verifying\n\nThe predicted 1H NMR spectrum for a **para-haloacetophenone** would be:\n*   **Methyl Protons (-COCH3):** These 3 protons are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon with no protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Their chemical shift is typically around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (on the C6H4 ring):** Due to the symmetry of the para-substitution, the 4 aromatic protons are chemically non-equivalent in two sets of two. This results in two signals, each appearing as a **doublet (d)** and integrating to **2H**. They will be in the aromatic region, typically **7.0-8.0 ppm**. The protons closer to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm).\n\nThe code below formalizes this deductive process.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef analyze_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes chemical data to identify the correct 1H NMR spectrum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- (a) Sampling: Define candidate structures based on initial clues ---\n    # Clues: C8 total, di-substituted benzene, C=O group, Ar-X bond.\n    # This leads to two main structural families.\n    candidates = {\n        \"para-haloacetophenone\": {\n            \"structure\": \"p-X-C6H4-COCH3\",\n            \"protons\": 7,\n            \"predicted_nmr\": {\n                \"Aromatic_H_ortho_to_CO\": {\"protons\": 2, \"multiplicity\": \"d\", \"shift_range\": (7.7, 8.1)},\n                \"Aromatic_H_ortho_to_X\": {\"protons\": 2, \"multiplicity\": \"d\", \"shift_range\": (7.0, 7.7)},\n                \"Methyl_H\": {\"protons\": 3, \"multiplicity\": \"s\", \"shift_range\": (2.0, 2.6)}\n            }\n        },\n        \"para-halophenylacetaldehyde\": {\n            \"structure\": \"p-X-C6H4-CH2CHO\",\n            \"protons\": 7,\n            \"predicted_nmr\": {\n                # NOTE: The splitting for this structure is key.\n                \"Aldehyde_H\": {\"protons\": 1, \"multiplicity\": \"t\", \"shift_range\": (9.5, 10.1)}, # Should be a triplet\n                \"Aromatic_H\": {\"protons\": 4, \"multiplicity\": \"m\", \"shift_range\": (7.0, 7.5)}, # Often two doublets\n                \"Methylene_H\": {\"protons\": 2, \"multiplicity\": \"d\", \"shift_range\": (3.6, 3.9)} # Should be a doublet\n            }\n        }\n        # Other isomers (ortho, meta) would have more complex aromatic signals (not two doublets).\n    }\n\n    # --- (b) Narrowing Candidates: Compare predictions with options ---\n    nmr_options = {\n        \"A\": \"1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)\",\n        \"B\": \"1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)\",\n        \"C\": \"1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)\",\n        \"D\": \"1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)\"\n    }\n\n    def parse_nmr_data(data_string):\n        \"\"\"Helper function to parse NMR data strings into a structured format.\"\"\"\n        # Example: \"7.8 (2H, d)\" -> {\"shift\": 7.8, \"protons\": 2, \"multiplicity\": \"d\"}\n        pattern = r\"(\\d+\\.\\d+)\\s*\\((\\d+)H,\\s*([a-z]+)\\)\"\n        matches = re.findall(pattern, data_string)\n        parsed = []\n        for shift, protons, mult in matches:\n            parsed.append({\"shift\": float(shift), \"protons\": int(protons), \"multiplicity\": mult})\n        # Sort by shift to make comparison easier\n        return sorted(parsed, key=lambda x: x['shift'])\n\n    parsed_options = {key: parse_nmr_data(value) for key, value in nmr_options.items()}\n\n    # --- (c) Exact Checks ---\n    verified_answer = None\n    reasoning = []\n\n    # Check Option C against para-haloacetophenone\n    option_c_data = parsed_options[\"C\"]\n    candidate_c = candidates[\"para-haloacetophenone\"]\n    match_c = True\n    # Check methyl signal: 2.3 (3H, s)\n    methyl_signal = option_c_data[0]\n    if not (methyl_signal[\"protons\"] == 3 and methyl_signal[\"multiplicity\"] == 's' and 2.0 <= methyl_signal[\"shift\"] <= 2.6):\n        match_c = False\n    # Check aromatic signals: 7.6 (2H, d), 7.8 (2H, d)\n    aromatic_signals = option_c_data[1:]\n    if not (len(aromatic_signals) == 2 and all(s[\"protons\"] == 2 and s[\"multiplicity\"] == 'd' and 7.0 <= s[\"shift\"] <= 8.1 for s in aromatic_signals)):\n        match_c = False\n    \n    if match_c:\n        verified_answer = \"C\"\n        reasoning.append(\"Option C perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for para-haloacetophenone:\")\n        reasoning.append(\"- 7.8 (2H, d) & 7.6 (2H, d): Correct pattern for 4H on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\")\n        reasoning.append(\"- 2.3 (3H, s): Correct pattern for a -COCH3 methyl group.\")\n        reasoning.append(\"- Total protons (3+2+2=7) is correct for C8H7OX.\")\n\n    # Check Option D against para-halophenylacetaldehyde\n    option_d_data = parsed_options[\"D\"]\n    candidate_d = candidates[\"para-halophenylacetaldehyde\"]\n    # The primary mismatch is the multiplicity.\n    aldehyde_signal = option_d_data[3] # 9.9 ppm\n    methylene_signal = option_d_data[0] # 3.7 ppm\n    \n    reasoning.append(\"\\n--- Analysis of Other Options ---\")\n    reasoning.append(\"Option A: Fails.
