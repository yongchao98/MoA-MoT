    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the RHIC energy problem.

    The problem asks for the energy of a Li nucleus (3 protons, 3 neutrons)
    moving at 0.96c. The provided answer is 20.132 GeV (Option A).

    The check proceeds by:
    1. Calculating the Lorentz factor (gamma).
    2. Using the given answer (E) and gamma to find the implied rest energy (E0 = E/gamma).
    3. Calculating the implied average mass per nucleon from this rest energy.
    4. Verifying if this implied mass is a physically plausible value.
