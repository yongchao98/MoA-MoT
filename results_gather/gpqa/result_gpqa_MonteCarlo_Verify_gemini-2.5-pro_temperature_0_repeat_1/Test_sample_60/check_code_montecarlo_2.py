    # Reaction: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution. Adds a -NO2 group.

    # Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene
    # Reagents: Br2, Fe

    # This reaction is selective and does not affect the C-Br bond.

    # Step 4: Diazotization
    # Reagents: NaNO2, HBF4
    # The primary aromatic amine is converted into a diazonium salt.
    # The product is 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate.

    # Step 5: Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction
    # Reagents: Heat, Anisole
    # The diazonium salt decomposes to form an aryl radical (3-bromophenyl radical).
    # This radical attacks the anisole (methoxybenzene) ring.
    # The methoxy group (-OCH3) on anisole is an ortho,para-director.
    # Due to less steric hindrance, attack at the para-position (4-position) is strongly favored.
    # The final product is formed by joining the 3-bromophenyl radical to the 4-position of anisole.
    # Resulting name: 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl

    The corrected Monte Carlo simulation and the deterministic verification are now in agreement. Both methods point to the same major product.

    1.  **Step 1: Nitration.** Benzene reacts with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ to form **nitrobenzene**.
    2.  **Step 2: Bromination.** Nitrobenzene is brominated with Br₂/Fe. The nitro group (-NO₂) is a strong deactivator and a **meta-director**. The major product is **1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene**.
    3.  **Step 3: Reduction.** The nitro group is reduced to an amine using H₂ and a Pd/C catalyst. This forms **3-bromoaniline**.
    4.  **Step 4: Diazotization.** 3-bromoaniline reacts with NaNO₂/HBF₄ to form a diazonium salt, **3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate**.
    5.  **Step 5: Coupling.** Heating the diazonium salt in the presence of anisole initiates a Gomberg-Bachmann reaction. The 3-bromophenyl radical is formed and attacks the anisole ring. The methoxy group (-OCH₃) on anisole is an **ortho,para-director**. Due to steric hindrance, attack at the para position is strongly favored. This results in the formation of **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**.
