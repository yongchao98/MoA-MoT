    # --- Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence ---

    # Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.
    # This is the electrophilic nitration of benzene.
    # Product 1: Nitrobenzene
    product_1 = "Nitrobenzene"
    
    # Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.
    # This is electrophilic bromination of nitrobenzene. The nitro group (-NO2) is a
    # strong deactivating group and a meta-director.
    # Product 2: 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene (or m-bromonitrobenzene)
    product_2 = "1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene"

    # Step 3: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 3.
    # This is the catalytic hydrogenation of the nitro group to an amino group.
    # The C-Br bond is typically stable under these conditions.
    # Product 3: 3-bromoaniline (or m-bromoaniline)
    product_3 = "3-bromoaniline"

    # Step 4: Product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4.
    # This is the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine to form a diazonium salt.
    # The use of HBF4 forms the tetrafluoroborate salt.
    # Product 4: 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate
    product_4 = "3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate"

    # Step 5: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole, forming final product 5.
    # This is a Gomberg-Bachmann reaction. The diazonium salt decomposes upon heating
    # to form a 3-bromophenyl radical. This radical attacks the anisole (methoxybenzene).
    # The methoxy group (-OCH3) on anisole is an ortho,para-director. Due to steric
    # hindrance, the para-substituted product is the major product.
    # The 3-bromophenyl group attaches to the para-position (C4) of anisole.
    # Final Product 5: 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl
    expected_final_product = "3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl"
