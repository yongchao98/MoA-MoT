    # --- Given values from the question ---
    # Periodic shift for planet #1's star
    delta_lambda_1 = 5  # in miliangstrom
    # Periodic shift for planet #2's star
    delta_lambda_2 = 7  # in miliangstrom

    # --- Constraints from the question ---
    # M_star1 = M_star2 (stars have same mass)
    # m_p1 = m_p2 (planets have same mass)
    # Orbits are circular

    # --- Physics Derivation from the LLM's answer ---
    # 1. The star's radial velocity amplitude K is proportional to the spectral line shift Δλ.
    #    K ∝ Δλ  =>  K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2
    # 2. For a circular orbit, the relationship is K = (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)) * (2πG / P)^(1/3).
    #    Assuming edge-on orbits (sin(i)=1, a reasonable simplification for this level of problem),
    #    and since m_p and M_star are the same for both systems, the relationship simplifies to:
    #    K ∝ P^(-1/3)
    # 3. Therefore, K1 / K2 = (P1)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)
    # 4. Combining the two ratios: Δλ1 / Δλ2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)
    # 5. Solving for the ratio of the periods (P2 / P1):
    #    P2 / P1 = (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^3
    # The derivation provided by the LLM is physically sound.
