    "To solve this problem, I will first use a randomized Monte Carlo simulation to explore the parameter space and propose a likely answer. Then, I will perform a deterministic derivation to verify the result.\n\nThe physics behind the Radial Velocity (RV) method connects the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) to the star's velocity amplitude (K), which in turn depends on the masses of the star (M_star) and planet (m_p), and the planet's orbital period (P). By simulating the systems with randomized (but plausible) values for the unknown base parameters (like the exact mass of the star or the rest wavelength of the spectral line), we can show that the final ratio of the periods is independent of these specifics. The deterministic check will then confirm this with a direct calculation based on the derived physical relationships.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef solve_exoplanet_period_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses randomized exploration and deterministic verification to find the\n    ratio of orbital periods for two exoplanets.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # =================================================================\n    # (a) Randomized/Monte Carlo Sampling\n    # =================================================================\n    # We run a simulation multiple times with randomized physical parameters\n    # to show that the result is independent of them.\n    \n    print(\"--- Starting Randomized/Monte Carlo Exploration ---\")\n    \n    num_samples = 500\n    ratios = []\n\n    for i in range(num_samples):\n        # Physical constants\n        G = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant\n        c = 299792458    # Speed of light\n\n        # The problem states masses are \"similar to\" the Sun and Neptune.\n        # We sample values in a plausible range to test the model's robustness.\n        # The final ratio should be independent of these specific values.\n        M_star = 1.989e30 * random.uniform(0.8, 1.2)  # Star mass in kg\n        m_p = 1.024e26 * random.uniform(0.8, 1.2)     # Planet mass in kg\n\n        # We also sample a random rest wavelength for the spectral line.\n        lambda_rest = random.uniform(400e-9, 700e-9) # Wavelength in meters\n\n        # Given data (wavelength shifts in miliangstroms, converted to meters)\n        delta_lambda_1 = 5e-3 * 1e-10  # 5 mÅ\n        delta_lambda_2 = 7e-3 * 1e-10  # 7 mÅ\n\n        # From the Doppler shift formula (Δλ/λ = v/c), we find the star's\n        # velocity amplitude K for each system.\n        K1 = c * delta_lambda_1 / lambda_rest\n        K2 = c * delta_lambda_2 / lambda_rest\n\n        # The relationship between K, P, and the masses is derived from\n        # Kepler's 3rd Law and conservation of momentum.

    "The problem has been analyzed using a Monte Carlo simulation which was then confirmed with a deterministic physical derivation. The feedback indicates this approach was correct.\n\nThe core physics is as follows:\n1.  The star's radial velocity amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the observed spectral line shift `Δλ`. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 5 / 7`.\n2.  For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude `K` is related to the planet's orbital period `P`, the star's mass `M_star`, and the planet's mass `m_p`. The relationship is `K ∝ m_p * M_star^(-2/3) * P^(-1/3)`.\n3.  Since both stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and both planets have the same mass (`m_p1 = m_p2`), the relationship simplifies to `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n4.  From this proportionality, we can write the ratio `K1 / K2 = (P1)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)`.\n5.  Combining the two results, we get `Δλ1 / Δλ2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)`.\n6.  To find the ratio of the periods `P2 / P1`, we cube both sides: `P2 / P1 = (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^3`.\n7.  Plugging in the given values: `P2 / P1 = (5 / 7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`.\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
