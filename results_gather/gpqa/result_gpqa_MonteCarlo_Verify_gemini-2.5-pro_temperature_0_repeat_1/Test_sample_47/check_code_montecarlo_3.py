    # The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C1 it's attached to,
    # and bisecting the C3-C4 bond.
    # 1. Aldehyde hydrogen (-CHO): Unique. (1 type)
    # 2. Hydrogen on C1 (the carbon attached to the aldehyde): Unique. (1 type)
    # 3. Hydrogens on C2 and C5: These carbons are equivalent by symmetry. However, the two hydrogens on each
    #    carbon are diastereotopic (one is cis to the -CHO group, one is trans). This creates two distinct sets. (2 types)
    # 4. Hydrogens on C3 and C4: These carbons are also equivalent by symmetry. The two hydrogens on each
    #    are also diastereotopic. This creates another two distinct sets. (2 types)
    # Total distinct hydrogens = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.
