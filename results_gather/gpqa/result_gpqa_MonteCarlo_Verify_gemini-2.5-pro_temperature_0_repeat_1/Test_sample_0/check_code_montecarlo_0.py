    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the quantum energy level resolution problem.

    The core principle is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time (ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ).
    For two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the difference in their energies must be
    greater than the sum of their individual energy widths (ΔE).
    
    Condition: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2
    where ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.
