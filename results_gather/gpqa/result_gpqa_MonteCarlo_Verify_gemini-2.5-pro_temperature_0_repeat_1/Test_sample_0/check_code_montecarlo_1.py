def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the quantum energy level resolution problem.

    The core principle is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time:
    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2

    This implies that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt) has an inherent
    uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), often called its natural linewidth.
    We can approximate this as ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.

    To "clearly resolve" or distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference
    between them must be significantly larger than their combined energy uncertainties.
    A standard criterion is that the energy difference |E2 - E1| must be greater
    than the sum of the individual linewidths (ΔE1 + ΔE2).
