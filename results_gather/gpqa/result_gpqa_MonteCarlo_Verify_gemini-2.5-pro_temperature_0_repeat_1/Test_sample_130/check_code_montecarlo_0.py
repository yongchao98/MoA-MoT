    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the Diels-Alder/NOESY problem.

    The function verifies the following logical steps:
    1.  The reactants are correctly identified as maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.
    2.  The two possible products are the endo and exo adducts.
    3.  The major proton signals are correctly predicted.
    4.  The major product is correctly identified. In this reaction, the significant steric hindrance from the four methyl groups on the diene favors the formation of the exo adduct over the endo adduct, overriding the usual Alder-Stein rule.
    5.  The unique NOESY correlation for the major (exo) product is identified. In the exo adduct, the anhydride protons are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups.
    6.  This correlation is matched against the provided options.
