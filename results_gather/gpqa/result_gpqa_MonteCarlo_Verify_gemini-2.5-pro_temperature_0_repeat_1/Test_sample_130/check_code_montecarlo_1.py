    # --- Chemical Analysis ---

    # Step 1: Identify Reactants and Reaction
    # - Anhydride: The NMR data (1H singlet ~7ppm, 2 13C peaks ~137/165ppm) for a dehydrated
    #   cis-dicarboxylic acid uniquely identifies Maleic Anhydride.
    # - Diene: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.
    # - Reaction: This is a classic Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition.
    # - Products: A cyclic diene reacting with a dienophile yields a bicyclic system.
    #   The formation of major and minor products indicates stereoisomerism, which in this
    #   context refers to the endo (major) and exo (minor) adducts.

    # Step 2: Analyze Product Structure and Symmetry
    # - The product is 1,4,5,6-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride.
    # - Crucially, both endo and exo products possess a plane of symmetry (Cs). This plane
    #   passes through the anhydride oxygen and the C7 bridge, bisecting the molecule.

    # Step 3: Predict 1H NMR Signals based on Symmetry
    # The plane of symmetry dictates that several groups of protons are chemically equivalent.
    # - Anhydride Protons (at C2, C3): These two protons are equivalent and have no adjacent
    #   protons to couple with. They must appear as a 2H singlet. Their chemical environment
    #   (alpha to a carbonyl on a strained ring) suggests a shift of ~3.5 ppm.
    # - Vinylic Methyls (at C5, C6): The two methyl groups on the double bond are equivalent.
    #   They will appear as a 6H singlet around ~1.7 ppm.
    # - Bridgehead Methyls (at C1, C4): The two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead
    #   carbons are also equivalent. They will appear as another 6H singlet, further upfield
    #   at ~1.0 ppm.

    # Step 4: Rule out Inconsistent Answer Options
    # Options A and D propose a "1H doublet". This is impossible given the product's symmetry.
    # The relevant protons on the anhydride moiety form a 2H singlet.
    if given_answer in ["A", "D"]:
        reason = (
            "Incorrect. The product has a plane of symmetry, making the two protons on the "
            "anhydride part of the molecule chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons "
            "to couple with, so they must appear as a 2H singlet. An option describing a '1H doublet' "
            "is inconsistent with the product's structure."
        )
        return reason

    # Step 5: Use NOESY Data to Differentiate Remaining Options
    # The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one.
    # This points to a spatial proximity that is unique to the major (endo) isomer.
    # - In the ENDO isomer (major): The anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are held close to the
    #   vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) due to the geometry of the bicyclic system. A strong
    #   NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.
    # - In the EXO isomer (minor): The anhydride protons point away from the vinylic methyl groups.
    #   The distance is large, so no significant NOESY cross-peak is expected.
    #
    # Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak connects the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the
    # 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.

    # Step 6: Final Check of the Given Answer
    if given_answer == "B":
        # Option B is: "A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm"
        # This perfectly matches the predicted distinguishing NOESY correlation.
        return "Correct"

    if given_answer == "C":
        # Option C is: "A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm"
        # This describes a correlation between the bridgehead methyls and vinylic methyls.
        # The distance between these groups is similar in both the endo and exo isomers.
        # Thus, this cross-peak would not be the key feature that is present in the major
        # product but absent in the minor one.
        reason = (
            "Incorrect. The cross-peak described in option C (between the two sets of methyl groups) "
            "does not depend significantly on the endo/exo stereochemistry. It would likely be present "
            "in both isomers. The question asks for a peak that is present in the major product but "
            "absent in the minor, which points to the interaction between the anhydride protons and "
            "the vinylic methyls, as described in option B."
