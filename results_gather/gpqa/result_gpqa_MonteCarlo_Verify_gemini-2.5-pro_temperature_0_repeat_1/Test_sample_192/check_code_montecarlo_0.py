    Checks the correctness of the answer by symbolically deriving the relationship
    between the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) and distance (r).

    The problem states:
    1. The number of stars per unit parallax (dN/d(plx)) is proportional to 1/plx^5.
    2. Parallax (plx) is related to distance (r) by plx = 1/r.

    The goal is to find the proportionality for dN/dr.
    The transformation rule is: dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|.
