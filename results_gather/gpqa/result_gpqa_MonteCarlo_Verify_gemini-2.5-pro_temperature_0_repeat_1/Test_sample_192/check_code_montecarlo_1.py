    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the astronomy question
    by performing a symbolic derivation using the sympy library.

    The question states:
    - Number of stars (N) varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5. This is interpreted
      as the number density with respect to parallax, dN/d(plx).
    - dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx^5

    The goal is to find the relationship for the number of stars per unit distance (r),
    which is dN/dr.

    The key steps are:
    1. Define the relationship between parallax and distance: plx = 1/r.
    2. Use the chain rule: dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr).
    3. Perform the substitutions and differentiation to find the final expression for dN/dr.
