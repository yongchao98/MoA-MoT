    # - 9.72 (t, 1H) & 3.66 (d, 2H): A -CH2-CHO group. The aldehyde proton is a triplet (coupled to CH2), and the CH2 protons are a doublet (coupled to the aldehyde CH).
    # - 6.98 (d, 2H) & 6.51 (d, 2H): A para-disubstituted benzene ring.
    # - 6.27 (bs, 2H): A primary amine group (-NH2).
    # - Molecular Formula C8H9NO: C6H4 (ring) + CH2CHO (side chain) + NH2 (group) = C8H9NO. This matches.
