    # --- Step 2: Retrosynthetic Analysis (from product to required reactant) ---
    # The product is a cyclohexene (6-membered ring).
    # Standard RCM of a 1,7-diene produces a cyclohexene and ethene.
    # Therefore, the starting material must be a derivative of an octa-1,7-diene.
    
    # The product's substituents are at C3, C4, and C5.
    # Product structure: C1=C2-C3(Me)-C4(Me)-C5(iPr)-C6
    
    # To find the precursor, we "unroll" the ring. The chain that cyclizes is C2-C3-C4-C5-C6-C1.
    # We add terminal double bonds to form the octa-1,7-diene.
    # Precursor chain: CH2=CH(2)-C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)-CH=CH2
    # The substituents from the product map directly onto this chain.
    # Required precursor substituents: methyl at C3, methyl at C4, isopropyl at C5.
    
    # --- Step 3: Determine the correct IUPAC name of the required reactant ---
    # Parent chain: octa-1,7-diene.
    # We must number the chain to give the lowest locants to substituents.
    # Numbering from one end: Substituents at 3(Me), 4(Me), 5(iPr). Locant set: (3, 4, 5).
    # Numbering from the other end: Substituents at 4(iPr), 5(Me), 6(Me). Locant set: (4, 5, 6).
    # The set (3, 4, 5) is lower, so we must use this numbering.
    
    # Alphabetize substituents: 'isopropyl' comes before 'methyl'.
