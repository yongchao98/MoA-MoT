def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the given answer for the speed of light in a moving medium.

    The problem is a classic application of the relativistic velocity addition formula.
    Let S be the laboratory frame and S' be the rest frame of the glass.
    - The velocity of the glass (S') relative to the lab (S) is v.
    - The speed of light in the glass's rest frame (S') is u' = c/n.
    - The speed of light in vacuum is given as c = 1. So, u' = 1/n.

    The relativistic velocity addition formula gives the speed u in the lab frame S:
    u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)

    Substituting u' = 1/n and c = 1, we get:
    u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2)
    
    Simplifying this expression by multiplying the numerator and denominator by n:
    u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)
    u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

    This derived formula is what we will check against the provided answer options.
