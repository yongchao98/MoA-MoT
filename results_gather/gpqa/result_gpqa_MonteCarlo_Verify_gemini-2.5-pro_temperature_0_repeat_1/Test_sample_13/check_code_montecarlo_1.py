    This function checks the correctness of an answer to a conceptual ChIP-seq question
    by encoding the underlying scientific principles into a logical framework.

    The Question:
    ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells
    produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely
    to find such disappearing peaks?

    A) In the introns of large genes
    B) At active promoters and enhancers
    C) At random locations in the genome
    D) At repeats

    The provided answer to check is 'B'.

    # --- Step 1: Define the scientific principles and entities ---

    # Principle: Different cross-linkers have different properties.
    # PFA is a short-range cross-linker, primarily fixing proteins directly to DNA.
    # DSG is a longer-range protein-protein cross-linker. Using PFA+DSG is a "stronger"
    # fixation method that is very effective at trapping large, stable protein complexes.
    
    # Principle: A known artifact/phenomenon with strong cross-linking is "epitope masking".

        "Epitope masking: The stronger PFA+DSG cross-linking can create such a dense, "
        "inter-linked protein mesh around the target protein (IKAROS) that the antibody "
        "can no longer physically access its binding site (the epitope). This leads to a "
        "failure to immunoprecipitate the protein-DNA complex, causing the peak to 'disappear'."
    )

    # Principle: Epitope masking is most likely to occur where the target protein is part of
    # a large, dense, multi-protein complex.

    # --- Step 2: Characterize the potential locations based on the principles ---

    # transcription factor like IKAROS would be active.
