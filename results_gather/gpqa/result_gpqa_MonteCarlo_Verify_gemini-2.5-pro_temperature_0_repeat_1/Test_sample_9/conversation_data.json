    "The problem asks to identify which of four hypothetical planets has the highest density. The core principle at play is gravitational compression: for planets of the same composition, a more massive planet will have stronger gravity, compressing its material into a smaller volume and thus resulting in a higher overall density.\n\nI will use a randomized approach by selecting a plausible physical parameter from a known range, and then use that parameter in a deterministic model to verify the outcome. The key parameter is the mass-radius exponent (`β`) for rocky planets, which typically falls in the range of 0.25 to 0.3. The relationship is `Radius ∝ Mass^β`. Density is `Mass / Volume`, and since `Volume ∝ Radius^3`, we get `Density ∝ Mass / (Mass^β)^3`, which simplifies to `Density ∝ Mass^(1 - 3β)`. Since `β` is less than 1/3, the exponent `(1 - 3β)` is positive, meaning density increases with mass for a fixed composition.\n\nThe Python code below will:\n1.  **Sample:** Select a random value for the mass-radius exponent `β` from the physically plausible range [0.25, 0.29].\n2.  **Narrow Candidates & Run Exact Checks:** Calculate the density for each of the four options using this sampled `β` and Earth's known density as a baseline.\n    *   a) An Earth-like planet.\n    *   b) A planet with a given density.\n    *   c) A 5-Earth-mass planet with Earth's composition.\n    *   d) A 0.5-Earth-mass planet with Earth's composition.\n3.  **Print Final Answer:** Compare the calculated densities and print the verified answer.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef analyze_planet_densities():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses randomized exploration and deterministic verification to find the densest planet.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- (a) Sampling ---\n    # The key physical parameter is the mass-radius exponent (beta) for rocky planets.\n    # For planets of the same composition, R ∝ M^beta.\n    # We sample a value from the physically accepted range for rocky planets (approx. 0.25-0.3).\n    # This represents our \"Monte Carlo\" exploration step.\n    beta = random.uniform(0.25, 0.29)\n\n    # --- (b) Narrowing Candidates & (c) Running Exact Checks ---\n    # We now use this sampled beta in a deterministic model to calculate densities.\n    # Density (rho) ∝ M / R^3 ∝ M / (M^beta)^3 ∝ M^(1 - 3*beta)\n    # Since beta < 1/3, the exponent is positive, so density increases with mass.\n    # This immediately suggests that (c) is the densest.
