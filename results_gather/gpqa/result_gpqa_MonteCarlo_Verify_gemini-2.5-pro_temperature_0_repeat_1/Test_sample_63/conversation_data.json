    "Here is the solution using the specified methodology.\n\nThe problem requires identifying two salts, A and B, based on the products of their thermal decomposition. The \"randomized/Monte Carlo\" step involves proposing likely candidates for these salts based on a high-level analysis of the products. The deterministic step involves rigorously verifying this proposal against all quantitative data provided.\n\n**1. High-Level Analysis & Candidate Proposal (Monte Carlo Exploration)**\n\n*   The initial mixture (7.20 g) of salts A and B decomposes completely into gases.\n*   The gases are H₂O (3.60 g), an oxidizing gas that contains 0.80 g of oxygen, and an inert gas C (2.24 L at STP).\n*   No CO₂ is formed, ruling out carbonates or organic salts.\n*   The presence of H₂O and a final inert gas (likely N₂) suggests the salts contain hydrogen and nitrogen. The presence of an oxidizing gas (like N₂O or O₂) and H₂O implies the presence of oxygen.\n*   Therefore, the salts are likely composed of H, N, and O. Common salts fitting this description that decompose into purely gaseous products are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n*   **Proposal:** A likely pair of salts is Ammonium Nitrate (`NH₄NO₃`) and Ammonium Nitrite (`NH₄NO₂`), which decompose as follows:\n    *   `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    *   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n\nThis proposal will now be deterministically verified.\n\n**2. Deterministic Verification and Final Answer**\n\nThe following Python code will verify if the proposed salts (`NH₄NO₃` and `NH₄NO₂`) in an equimolar mixture match all the experimental data. If the verification is successful, it will calculate the total number of atoms as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_molar_mass(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the molar mass of a given formula string.\"\"\"\n    atomic_masses = {'H': 1.008, 'N': 14.007, 'O': 15.999}\n    counts = {}\n    if formula == \"NH4NO3\":\n        counts = {'N': 2, 'H': 4, 'O': 3}\n    elif formula == \"NH4NO2\":\n        counts = {'N': 2, 'H': 4, 'O': 2}\n    \n    mass = sum(count * atomic_masses[elem] for elem, count in counts.items())\n    return mass\n\ndef count_atoms(formula):\n    \"\"\"Counts the total atoms in a formula unit.\"\"\"\n    if formula == \"NH4NO3\":\n        return 2 + 4 + 3  # N, H, O\n    elif formula == \"NH4NO2\":\n        return 2 + 4 + 2  # N, H, O\n    return 0\n\n# (a) Sample: Propose candidate salts based on preliminary analysis.\ncandidate_A = \"NH4NO3\"\ncandidate_B = \"NH4NO2\"\nprint(f\"Step (a): Proposing salts A = {candidate_A} and B = {candidate_B}\")\n\n# (b) Narrow Candidates: Use the proposed salts to model the experiment.\nprint(\"\\nStep (b): Modeling the experiment with the proposed salts.\")\n\n# Experimental data from the problem\ninitial_mixture_mass = 7.20  # g\nh2o_mass_increase = 3.60  # g\ncu_tube_mass_increase = 0.80  # g (mass of Oxygen)\nfinal_gas_volume_stp = 2.24  # L\nno_co2_produced = True\n\n# Constants\nM_H2O = get_molar_mass(\"H2O\".replace(\"H2\",\"H H\").replace(\"O\",\"O\")) # A bit of a hack for the helper\nM_H2O = 2 * 1.008 + 15.999\nM_O = 15.999\nVOL_MOLAR_STP = 22.4  # L/mol\n\n# Calculate moles of each salt ('n') from the total mass, assuming an equimolar mixture.\nM_A = get_molar_mass(candidate_A)\nM_B = get_molar_mass(candidate_B)\n# Equation: n * M_A + n * M_B = initial_mixture_mass\nn = initial_mixture_mass / (M_A + M_B)\nprint(f\"Calculated moles of each salt (n) = {n:.4f} mol\")\n\n# Based on the proposed decomposition reactions:\n# n NH₄NO₃ + n NH₄NO₂ → n N₂O + 2n H₂O + n N₂ + 2n H₂O\n# Total products: 4n H₂O, n N₂O, n N₂\n# The gas mixture is passed through the tubes:\n# 1.
