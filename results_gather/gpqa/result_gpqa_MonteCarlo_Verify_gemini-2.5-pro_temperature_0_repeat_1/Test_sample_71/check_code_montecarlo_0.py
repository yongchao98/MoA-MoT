    This function verifies the correctness of the provided answer by checking

    # Step 1: Define the identity of the final product based on the provided chemical reasoning.
    # The reasoning (retro-Diels-Alder) correctly identifies the final product as
    # the diene used in the initial step.
    final_product_name = "5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene"

    # Step 2: Analyze the symmetry of this molecule to count distinct hydrogen atoms.
    # The molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the midpoints of the
    # C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This symmetry dictates which atoms are equivalent.
    
    # We can group the 8 hydrogen atoms into sets of chemically equivalent protons.

    # Group A: Ring Protons (4 total protons on C1, C2, C3, C4)
    # - The C2 axis makes the proton on C1 equivalent to the proton on C4.
    # - The C2 axis makes the proton on C2 equivalent to the proton on C3.
    # This gives 2 distinct sets of protons from the ring.
    ring_proton_sets = 2

    # Group B: Exocyclic Methylene Protons (4 total protons on the two =CH2 groups)
    # - The C2 axis makes the entire =CH2 group on C5 equivalent to the =CH2 group on C6.
    # - Within a single =CH2 group, the two protons are in different chemical environments
    #   (they are diastereotopic) because the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry
    #   that would make them equivalent. One proton is "cis" to the C4-C5 bond,
    #   the other is "trans".
    # - Therefore, the two protons on one methylene group are distinct from each other.
    # This gives another 2 distinct sets of protons from the methylene groups.
    methylene_proton_sets = 2

    # Step 3: Calculate the total number of distinct hydrogen environments.
