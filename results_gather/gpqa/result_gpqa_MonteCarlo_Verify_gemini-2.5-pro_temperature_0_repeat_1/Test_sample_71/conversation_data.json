    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants**: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a norbornadiene derivative), 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, and sodium iodide (NaI).\n    *   **Reaction**: This step involves an *in situ* generation of a reactive diene followed by a double Diels-Alder reaction.\n        *   The precursor `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` reacts with NaI in a reductive elimination reaction to form `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. This is a reactive molecule containing a conjugated diene system (`C1=C2-C3=C4`).\n        *   The `7-(tert-butoxy)norbornadiene` acts as a dienophile, having two reactive double bonds.\n        *   Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, with one molecule of the generated diene adding to each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative. This forms a large, complex polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   **Reagents**: Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n    *   **Reaction**: These are standard acidic conditions for the cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The `tert-butoxy` group (-OtBu) on Product 1 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming the corresponding alcohol, **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   **Reagents**: SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation).\n    *   **Reaction**: This is a mild oxidation that converts the secondary alcohol (-OH) of Product 2 into a ketone (C=O). This forms **Product 3**, a complex polycyclic ketone.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   **Condition**: Heating at 150°C.\n    *   **Reaction**: Complex polycyclic molecules like Product 3, which are formed from Diels-Alder reactions, often undergo fragmentation upon heating via a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**.\n        *   The two Diels-Alder adducts in Product 3 will sequentially break apart.\n        *   The central norbornanone core will also fragment. The 7-oxonorbornadiene intermediate is known to be thermally unstable and undergoes a cheletropic elimination to release carbon monoxide (CO) and form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.\n        *   The overall fragmentation is: `Product 3 → Benzene + CO + 2 * (Diene)`\n    *   **Identity of Product 4**: The question asks for the number of distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4\". In the context of such fragmentation reactions, this typically refers to the main, non-trivial organic product, which is the diene that was used in the initial cycloaddition. Therefore, **Product 4 is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n\n### Symmetry Analysis of Product 4\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4, we analyze its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure**: `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` (C₈H₈). It has a six-membered ring with double bonds at positions 1,3 and exocyclic double bonds at positions 5,6.\n*   **Symmetry**: The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This symmetry means that atoms can be interchanged by a 180° rotation, making them chemically equivalent.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens**:\n    1.  **Ring Vinyl Protons**: There are four such protons (H1, H2, H3, H4).\n        *   The C₂ axis relates H1 to H4. They are equivalent (Set 1).\n        *   The C₂ axis relates H2 to H3. They are equivalent (Set 2).\n    2.  **Exocyclic Methylene Protons**: There are four protons on the two `=CH₂` groups.\n        *   The two `=CH₂` groups (at C5 and C6) are equivalent, related by the C₂ axis.\n        *   On any single `=CH₂` group, the two protons are in different chemical environments (they are diastereotopic) because the overall molecule is chiral.\n        *   Let's call the two non-equivalent protons on the C5 methylene group H_A and H_B. The C₂ symmetry makes H_A on C5 equivalent to H_A on C6 (Set 3), and H_B on C5 equivalent to H_B on C6 (Set 4).\n\nIn total, there are four sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function formalizes the chemical reasoning to determine the number of\n    distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # (a) Sampling: Propose a likely reaction pathway.\n    # The most plausible thermal reaction for the complex adduct (Product 3) is\n    # fragmentation via retro-Diels-Alder and cheletropic elimination.\n    # This is a common, entropically favored process at elevated temperatures.\n    # Proposed fragmentation: Product 3 -> Benzene + CO + 2 * Diene\n    pathway_hypothesis = \"Thermal Fragmentation (Retro-Diels-Alder)\"\n\n    # (b) Narrowing Candidates: Identify the final product of interest.\n    # The question asks about \"product 4\", which is interpreted as the main\n    # organic product from the fragmentation, the diene itself.\n    product_4_identity = \"5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene\"\n    product_4_formula = \"C8H8\"\n\n    # (c) Running Exact Checks: Analyze the symmetry and count distinct protons.\n    # The molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry.\n    symmetry_group = \"C2\"\n    \n    # Protons on the ring's conjugated system (4 total protons)\n    # H on C1 is equivalent to H on C4.\n    # H on C2 is equivalent to H on C3.\n    ring_proton_sets = 2\n\n    # Protons on the two exocyclic =CH2 groups (4 total protons)\n    # The two =CH2 groups are equivalent by C2 symmetry.\n    # The two protons on a single =CH2 group are diastereotopic (not equivalent).\n    # This results in two sets of equivalent protons for the four methylene hydrogens.\n    methylene_proton_sets = 2\n\n    # Calculate the total number of distinct hydrogen environments.\n    total_distinct_h_atoms = ring_proton_sets + methylene_proton_sets\n\n    # (d) Print the final verified answer.\n    print(\"--- Chemical Analysis Summary ---\")\n    print(f\"Hypothesis for Step 4: {pathway_hypothesis}\")\n    print(f\"Identity of Product 4: {product_4_identity} ({product_4_formula})\")\n    print(f\"Symmetry of Product 4: {symmetry_group}\")\n    print(f\"Number of distinct ring proton sets: {ring_proton_sets}\")\n    print(f\"Number of distinct methylene proton sets: {methylene_proton_sets}\")\n    print(f\"Total chemically distinct hydrogen atoms: {total_distinct_h_atoms}\")\n    \n    # Match with options: A) 8, B) 4, C) 7, D) 10\n    final_answer_option = 'B'\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated number ({total_distinct_h_atoms}) corresponds to option {final_answer_option}.\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_puzzle()\n```\n<<<B>>>",
