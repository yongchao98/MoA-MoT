def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the given answer to the question about designing a diagnostic kit for a retrovirus.

    The function evaluates each option based on key scientific principles:
    1.  **Retrovirus Nature**: A retrovirus has an RNA genome. Any molecular technique must account for this, typically by using reverse transcription to create complementary DNA (cDNA).
    2.  **Molecular vs. Immunological**: The question asks for a "molecular diagnostic kit," which detects the pathogen's genetic material (RNA/DNA), not the host's immune response (antibodies) or viral proteins.
    3.  **Method Soundness**: The proposed method for identifying the virus must be scientifically valid for designing the subsequent kit. For example, symptoms are not sufficient to design specific PCR primers.
    4.  **Kit Suitability**: The final kit should be suitable for "quick and accurate" diagnosis, a key requirement for an outbreak.
