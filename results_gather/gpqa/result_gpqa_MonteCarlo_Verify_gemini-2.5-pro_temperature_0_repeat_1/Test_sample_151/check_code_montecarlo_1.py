The logically derived answer is '{least_abundant_option}'.

Reasoning:
1.  A yeast shmoo is arrested in the G1 phase and is focused on transcribing mating-related genes.
2.  The experiment (ChIP-MS of active chromatin) will enrich for proteins involved in active transcription.
3.  The pre-initiation complex (B) and enhancer protein complexes (C) are directly responsible for this transcription and would be highly abundant.
4.  Nucleosomes (D) are the fundamental components of the chromatin being analyzed and would also be abundant.
5.  The pre-replication complex (A) prepares for DNA replication (S phase), a process that is actively INHIBITED in the G1-arrested shmoo. Therefore, it is the least associated with the primary cellular activity and the active chromatin being studied.
