    # Check Reaction 1: A + H2SO4 ---> 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one
    # This transformation is an oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone.
    # The reactant should be the corresponding alcohol.
    product_A = question['reaction_1']['product']
    
    # We expect the reactant to be the alcohol version of the ketone product.
    # A simple check is to see if the reactant name is the product name with "-one" replaced by "-ol".

        return (f"Incorrect. For Reaction 1, the reactant from option {llm_answer} ('{reactant_A}') "
                f"is not the direct alcohol precursor ('{expected_reactant_A}') for the product '{product_A}'.")

    # Now, check the reagent. H2SO4 is a dehydrating agent, not an oxidant.
    # This confirms the LLM's reasoning that the reagent is likely a typo.
    # A correct oxidant would be something like H2CrO4 (Jones reagent), PCC, etc.
    # The structural relationship is correct, so we proceed.

    # Check Reaction 2: B + BuLi + H+ ---> 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol
    # This transformation is a reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol.
    # The reactant should be the corresponding ketone.
    product_B = question['reaction_2']['product']
    
    # We expect the reactant to be the ketone version of the alcohol product.
    expected_reactant_B = product_B.replace('-ol', '-one')

        return (f"Incorrect. For Reaction 2, the reactant from option {llm_answer} ('{reactant_B}') "
                f"is not the direct ketone precursor ('{expected_reactant_B}') for the product '{product_B}'.")

    # Now, check the reagent. BuLi is a strong base/nucleophile, not a reducing agent.
    # It would add a butyl group to the ketone. A correct reagent would be NaBH4 or LiAlH4.
    # This again confirms the LLM's reasoning about a reagent typo.
    # The structural relationship is correct.

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    # Since both reactant-product pairs from option D are structurally the most direct precursors,
    # the answer is correct under the reasonable assumption that the reagents in the question are typos.
    return "Correct"
