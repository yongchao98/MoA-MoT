    # --- Step 1: Aldol Addition Analysis ---
    # Reaction: Cyclohexanone + LDA -> Enolate; Enolate + Benzaldehyde -> Aldol Adduct
    # Key Principles:
    # 1. LDA forms the kinetic enolate. For cyclohexanone, the enolate is effectively an (E)-enolate.
    # 2. The Zimmerman-Traxler model predicts that an (E)-lithium enolate gives the 'anti' aldol product as major.
    # 3. The 'anti' product has two new stereocenters. We can represent one enantiomer as (ring_C2: 'R', benzylic_C: 'S').
    # Product 1: 2-((S)-hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one with a (2R) configuration on the ring.
    product_1_major_enantiomer_stereochem = {'ring_C2': 'R', 'benzylic_C': 'S'}

    # --- Step 2: DAST Fluorination Analysis ---
    # Reaction: Product 1 + excess DAST -> Product 2
    # Key Principles:
    # 1. "Excess" DAST reacts with both the ketone and the alcohol.
    # 2. Ketone (at C1) -> Geminal Difluoride (at C1). This does not affect stereocenters.
    # 3. Secondary Alcohol -> Fluoride. This reaction proceeds with INVERSION of configuration.
    
    # Applying the principles to our major enantiomer:
    predicted_product_2_stereochem = {
        'ring_C': product_1_major_enantiomer_stereochem['ring_C2'],  # Unchanged, remains 'R'
        'benzylic_C': 'R'  # Inverts from 'S' to 'R'
    }
    # The predicted major product has (ring_C: 'R', benzylic_C: 'R') stereochemistry (or its S,S enantiomer).

    # --- Step 3: Evaluating the Given Answer ---
    # The provided answer is C.
    # C) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene

    # First, eliminate other options based on functional groups.
    # B) ...cyclohexan-1-one -> Incorrect. Ketone should have reacted with excess DAST.
    # D) ...cyclohexan-1-ol -> Incorrect. Ketone becomes a gem-difluoride, not a fluoroalcohol.

    # Now, compare the stereochemistry of A and C.
    # A) ((S)-((R)-...)) -> benzylic_C is 'S', ring_C is 'R'. This would come from the minor 'syn' aldol product.
    # C) ((R)-((R)-...)) -> benzylic_C is 'R', ring_C is 'R'.
    answer_C_stereochem = {'benzylic_C': 'R', 'ring_C': 'R'}

    # Final Comparison:
    if predicted_product_2_stereochem == answer_C_stereochem:
        # The stereochemistry matches the major product pathway.
        # We note that the IUPAC name in the option has a regiochemical error (2,2-difluoro instead of 1,1-difluoro),
        # but among the choices, C is the only one with the correct stereochemistry for the major product.
        return "Correct"
    else:
        return (f"Incorrect. The predicted stereochemistry for the major product is {predicted_product_2_stereochem}, "
                f"but the answer C has stereochemistry {answer_C_stereochem}.")
