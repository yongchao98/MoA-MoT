    "This is a chemical deduction problem that can be solved by systematically evaluating the clues. We can frame this as a search problem, where we propose identities for the unknown substances and then verify if they fit all the given constraints.\n\n### Step-by-Step Deduction\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B**: The melting point is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is an excellent match.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K), which is also \"close\".\n    *   Let's hypothesize B is D₂O, as it's a much better fit.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G**: G is heated to release B (D₂O). This means G is a deuterated hydrate or a metal deuteroxide that decomposes to an oxide and D₂O upon heating. For example, `M(OD)n -> M_xO_y + D₂O`.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W**: The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   Let's check common small molecules and their deuterated analogs (since D₂O is involved).\n    *   H₂: 2p, 0n (No)\n    *   N₂: 14p, 14n (Yes)\n    *   CO: 14p, 14n (Yes)\n    *   HF: 10p, 10n (Yes)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂): 2p, 2n (Yes)\n    *   CD₄ (Deuterated methane): 10p, 10n (Yes)\n    *   ND₃ (Deuterated ammonia): 10p, 10n (Yes)\n    *   D₂O (Heavy water vapor): 10p, 10n (Yes)\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reaction**: Substance X (containing a heavy isotope) reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W and precipitate G.\n    *   Given our hypothesis that D₂O is involved, a plausible scenario is the reaction of a deuteride with heavy water.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that **X is a deuteride**, **Y is D₂O**, and **W is D₂**.\n    *   The clue \"X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points strongly to common reducing agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) or Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   Let's test **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n    *   This reaction is violent (Yes).\n    *   Liquid Y is D₂O (Yes).\n    *   Gas W is D₂ (p=n, Yes).\n    *   Precipitate G is Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide). Aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate, so this is highly plausible (Yes).\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) gives `Al₂O₃ + D₂O`, releasing B=D₂O (Yes).\n\n5.  **Final Verification**: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone (`-C=O`) and a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) group.\n    *   X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both groups to alcohols.\n    *   `R-CO-COOH` --(1. LiAlD₄ / 2. H₂O workup)--> `R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)`\n    *   The product is a diol, which has exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms our identification.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n\n7.  **Calculation**: Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   Elements by atomic number (Z): H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13).\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (present as isotope Deuterium, D or ²H).\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (present as isotope ²⁷Al).\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄. There are 4 atoms of the lightest element and 1 atom of the heaviest.\n    *   Mass of all Hydrogen (Deuterium) atoms = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of all Aluminum atoms = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this deductive process and calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_chemical_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses a structured deduction process to identify Substance X and calculate the required value.\n    This process mimics a search-and-verify methodology.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: (Sampling/Exploration) Propose candidates based on clues.\n    # Clue: B's melting point is ~277 K.\n    candidates_B = {\n        'D2O': {'melting_K': 276.97, 'name': 'Heavy Water'},\n        'H2O': {'melting_K': 273.15, 'name': 'Water'},\n        'Benzene': {'melting_K': 278.7, 'name': 'Benzene'}\n    }\n\n    # Clue: Gas W has equal protons and neutrons.\n    # p=protons, n=neutrons\n    candidates_W = {\n        'D2': {'p': 2, 'n': 2, 'name': 'Deuterium gas'},\n        'N2': {'p': 14, 'n': 14, 'name': 'Nitrogen gas'},\n        'CO': {'p': 14, 'n': 14, 'name': 'Carbon Monoxide'},\n        'HF': {'p': 10, 'n': 10, 'name': 'Hydrogen Fluoride'}\n    }\n\n    # Clue: X is an organic reagent analog with a heavy isotope.\n    candidates_X = {\n        'LiAlD4': {'name': 'Lithium aluminum deuteride', 'analog': 'LiAlH4'},\n        'NaBD4': {'name': 'Sodium borodeuteride', 'analog': 'NaBH4'}\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: (Narrowing Candidates) Find a consistent reaction scenario.\n    # We iterate through hypotheses to find one that fits all constraints.\n    verified_scenario = None\n    for x_name, x_props in candidates_X.items():\n        for b_name, b_props in candidates_B.items():\n            # The reaction must produce a precipitate G that decomposes to B.\n            # The reaction must produce a gas W from our candidate list.\n            # Let's test the most likely scenario based on the clues.\n            \n            # Hypothesis: X=LiAlD4, Y=D2O, B=D2O, W=D2, G=Al(OD)3\n            if x_name == 'LiAlD4' and b_name == 'D2O':\n                # Reaction: LiAlD4 + 4D2O -> LiOD + Al(OD)3(precipitate) + 4D2(gas)\n                current_W = 'D2'\n                current_G_decomposes_to = 'D2O'\n                \n                # Check if this scenario is consistent\n                is_consistent = True\n                \n                # Check W: Is D2 in our candidate list?\n                if current_W not in candidates_W:\n                    is_consistent = False\n                \n                # Check G->B: Does G decompose to our candidate B?\n                if current_G_decomposes_to != b_name:\n                    is_consistent = False\n\n                # Check B melting point: Is it very close to 277K?\n                if not np.isclose(b_props['melting_K'], 277, atol=1.0):\n                    is_consistent = False\n\n                # Check keto acid reaction: LiAlD4 reduces a keto acid (2 reducible groups)\n                # to a diol (2 oxygen atoms).
