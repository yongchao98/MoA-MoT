    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the chemistry problem.
    It follows these logical steps:
    1.  Use the mass percentage of fluorine in A2 to identify the element Y.
    2.  Calculate the molecular weights of the binary fluorides of Y.
    3.  Check which of these molecular weights falls into the ranges provided in the options.
    4.  Verify if the given answer 'B' corresponds to one of the plausible compounds.
