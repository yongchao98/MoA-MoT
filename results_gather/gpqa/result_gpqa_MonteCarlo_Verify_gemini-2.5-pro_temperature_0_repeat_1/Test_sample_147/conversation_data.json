    "Here is a thinking process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Initial Analysis & Strategy:** The problem describes five binary fluorides (A1-A5) of an unknown element Y. The goal is to find the molecular weight range of A4. The most quantitative clue is the mass percentage of fluorine in A2 (31.96%). This is the best starting point to identify element Y. The overall strategy will be:\n    a.  Use the mass percentage of A2 to generate a list of possible elements (Y) and corresponding formulas (YFₙ). This is the \"sampling\" or \"exploration\" phase.\n    b.  Use the other chemical clues (reactivity with Xenon, number of fluorides, reaction conditions) to \"narrow\" the candidates down to the most likely element Y.\n    c.  Once Y is identified, analyze the reaction for A4 and A5 (`Y + A4 -> A5` in 1:1 ratio) to determine the identity of A4. This involves checking against known chemistry and the remaining clues.\n    d.  Calculate the molecular weight of the proposed A4 and see which range it falls into. This is the \"exact check\".\n    e.  Verify that the entire story is chemically consistent.\n\n2.  **Step (a): Sampling Candidates for Y**\n    *   Let A2 be YFₙ. The molar mass of Y is M(Y) and fluorine is M(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol.\n    *   The mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) is given as 31.96% or 0.3196.\n    *   The formula is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    *   Rearranging for M(Y): M(Y) = (n * M(F) / ɷF) - n * M(F)\n    *   M(Y) = n * [ (19.0 / 0.3196) - 19.0 ] ≈ n * (59.45 - 19.0) ≈ n * 40.45 g/mol.\n    *   Now, we can \"sample\" integer values for n (the oxidation state) to find plausible atomic masses for Y.\n        *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.5 (Ca, K). These don't form five binary fluorides.\n        *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 (Br). Bromine fluorides (BrF, BrF₃, BrF₅) exist, but the properties don't fully match (e.g., decomposition of A1).\n        *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 (Sb). Antimony (M=121.76) is an excellent fit.\n        *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 (Dy). Dysprosium (M=162.5) is a good numerical fit, but its chemistry (lanthanide) is less likely to fit the reactivity clues (e.g., oxidizing Xe).\n        *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 (Hg, Tl).\n        *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 (Pu). Plutonium (M≈244) is a good numerical fit.\n\n3.  **Step (b): Narrowing Candidates**\n    *   Let's focus on the most promising candidates: Sb and Pu.\n    *   **Candidate Y = Pu**: If n=6, A2 would be PuF₆. The clue \"A1 decomposes ... into A2 and fluorine\" means A1 must be a higher fluoride than PuF₆, which is impossible. If A1=PuF₆, it decomposes to PuF₄, so A2=PuF₄. The mass % of F in PuF₄ is (4*19)/(244+76) = 23.75%, which does not match the given 31.96%. So, Y is not Pu.\n    *   **Candidate Y = Sb**: If n=3, A2 is SbF₃. Let's check the mass % precisely: ɷF in SbF₃ = (3*19.0)/(121.76 + 3*19.0) = 57/178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is very close to the given 31.96% and is the most plausible identification.\n    *   Let's check other clues for Y=Sb:\n        *   \"Five binary compounds\": SbF₃ and SbF₅ are common. Mixed-valence/subfluorides like Sb₂F₄ (often written as SbF₂) and SbF are also described, along with polymeric forms. The existence of five compounds is plausible.\n        *   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y\": Sb + F₂ → SbF₅. This is the standard synthesis for A3=SbF₅.\n        *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon\": SbF₅ is a classic Lewis acid and strong fluorinating agent used in xenon chemistry (e.g., to make [XeF]⁺[SbF₆]⁻). This fits perfectly.\n    *   Conclusion: Element Y is Antimony (Sb). A2 is SbF₃ and A3 is SbF₅.\n\n4.  **Step (c): Running Exact Checks for A4**\n    *   The core remaining clue is: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   This describes a comproportionation reaction: `Sb(0) + A4 -> A5`. The oxidation state of Sb in A5 must be lower than in A4.\n    *   The 1:1 molar ratio is key. Let's consider a general reaction `a Y + b YFₙ -> c YFₘ`. The problem states a:b = 1:1.\n    *   Let's test simple, clean comproportionations. The reaction `Sb + SbF₂ -> 2SbF` fits the 1:1 stoichiometry perfectly. In this scheme, the oxidation states are Sb(0) + Sb(+2) → 2 Sb(+1).\n    *   This identifies A4 as the compound with the empirical formula SbF₂ and A5 with the formula SbF.\n    *   The final clue, \"In water, A5 decomposes\", is consistent with a subfluoride like SbF being unstable in water.\n\n5.  **Step (d): Final Calculation and Verification**\n    *   Our proposed identity for A4 is the substance with the empirical formula SbF₂.\n    *   The question asks for the molecular weight of A4. While the true substance is a mixed-valence polymer (Sb₂F₄, etc.), the stoichiometry points to the empirical formula unit. In multiple-choice questions, we often calculate the empirical formula weight.\n    *   Empirical Formula Weight of A4 (SbF₂) = M(Sb) + 2 * M(F) = 121.76 + 2 * 19.00 = 159.76 g/mol.\n    *   Now, check the given ranges:\n        *   A) 220-240\n        *   B) 140-160\n        *   C) 110-130\n        *   D) 160-180\n    *   The calculated weight of 159.76 g/mol falls squarely in the range **B) 140-160**.\n\nThis deterministic check confirms the hypothesis derived from the exploration phase.
