    # --- Step 1: Define the given parameters from the question ---
    # The orbital periods (P) are in a ratio of P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.
    # We can represent these with their proportional values.

    # --- Step 2: Apply the relevant physical laws to derive the formula ---
    # The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its semi-major axis (a), assuming same albedo and star.
    # T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)
    # Therefore, the ratio of temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is (a4/a2)^(-1/2) = (a2/a4)^(1/2).

    # Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).
    # P^2 ∝ a^3  =>  a ∝ P^(2/3)
    # Therefore, the ratio of semi-major axes a2 / a4 is (P2/P4)^(2/3).

    # Substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law into the temperature ratio formula:
    # T_eq4 / T_eq2 = ((P2/P4)^(2/3))^(1/2)
    # T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2/P4)^((2/3) * (1/2))
    # T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3)
    # This confirms the formula used in the LLM's reasoning is correct.

    # --- Step 3: Perform the calculation ---
    # Calculate the ratio of the periods P2 / P4.
    period_ratio = P2_ratio / P4_ratio

    # Calculate the final temperature ratio.
    calculated_temp_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)

    # --- Step 4: Compare the calculated result with the provided answer ---
    # We use a tolerance for comparing floating-point numbers. A tolerance of 0.01 is reasonable for an answer given to two decimal places.
