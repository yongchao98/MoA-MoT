def check_pseudosphere_area():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the area of the pseudosphere.

    The question asks for the area of a surface with the metric:
    ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) * (dx^2 + dy^2)
    The domain is implied by the denominator to be the open disk x^2 + y^2 < 4.

    The area element is dA = sqrt(det(g)) dx dy.
    The metric tensor g is diagonal with g_xx = g_yy = 32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2).
    det(g) = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2))^2.
    So, dA = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) dx dy.

    The total area A is the integral of dA over the disk D = {(x, y) | x^2 + y^2 < 4}.
    A = ∫∫_D (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) dx dy.

    This integral is best solved using polar coordinates.
    Let x = ρ*cos(θ), y = ρ*sin(θ). Then x^2 + y^2 = ρ^2 and dx dy = ρ dρ dθ.
    The domain becomes 0 <= ρ < 2 and 0 <= θ < 2π.

    The integral transforms to:
    A = ∫[from 0 to 2π] dθ * ∫[from 0 to 2] (32 / (4 - ρ^2)) * ρ dρ.

    The LLM's answer is C, which corresponds to +infinity. This function will verify this by
    calculating the integral symbolically.
