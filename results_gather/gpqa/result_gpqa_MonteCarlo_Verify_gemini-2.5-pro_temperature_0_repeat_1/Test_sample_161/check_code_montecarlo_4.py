    Checks the correctness of the area calculation for the given metric.

    The area A is given by the integral:
    A = ∫∫_D sqrt(g) dx dy
    where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

    For the metric ds^2 = f(x,y)(dx^2 + dy^2), the area element is f(x,y) dx dy.
    Here, f(x,y) = 32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2).

    The integral is A = ∫∫_{x^2+y^2<4} (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) dx dy.

    In polar coordinates (ρ, θ), this becomes:
    A = ∫(θ=0 to 2π) ∫(ρ=0 to 2) [32 / (4 - ρ^2)] * ρ dρ dθ.
    This is an improper integral due to the singularity at ρ=2.
