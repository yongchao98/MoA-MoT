    "Answering this question requires calculating the rest-frame energy of the observed absorption line by correcting for cosmological redshift, and then identifying which component of the interstellar medium (ISM) is associated with that energy.\n\n1.  **Calculate Redshift (z):** The distance to the object is given as 2.1 Gpc. We can estimate the redshift using the Hubble-Lemaître law, v = H₀D, and the relativistic approximation for redshift, z ≈ v/c. The Hubble constant (H₀) is known to be approximately 70 km/s/Mpc.\n2.  **Calculate Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest):** The observed energy (E_obs) is related to the rest-frame energy by E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z).\n3.  **Identify the Transition:** The calculated rest-frame energy can be compared to known spectral lines from different phases of the ISM to identify the source.\n\nThe Monte Carlo exploration will sample different plausible values for the Hubble constant to determine the likely rest-frame energy. The deterministic check will then verify this identification.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef solve_ism_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses randomized exploration and deterministic verification to identify the ISM component.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Given Facts ---\n    D_gpc = 2.1  # Distance in Gigaparsecs\n    E_obs_ev = 3.9e-6  # Observed energy in electron volts\n\n    # --- Physical Constants ---\n    # Speed of light in km/s\n    c_kms = 299792.458\n    # Conversion from Gpc to Mpc\n    D_mpc = D_gpc * 1000\n    # Rest energy of the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen (H I)\n    # E = h*nu, where nu = 1420.40575 MHz\n    # h = 4.1357e-15 eV*s\n    E_21cm_rest_ev = 4.1357e-15 * 1420.40575e6\n    \n    print(\"--- Monte Carlo Exploration ---\")\n    print(\"(a) Sampling plausible Hubble constant values (H₀) to estimate rest-frame energy.\")\n    \n    num_samples = 1000\n    estimated_rest_energies = []\n    \n    # Plausible range for H₀ in km/s/Mpc\n    h0_min = 67.0\n    h0_max = 74.0\n\n    for _ in range(num_samples):\n        # Sample a value for the Hubble constant\n        h0_sample = random.uniform(h0_min, h0_max)\n        \n        # Calculate recessional velocity using Hubble's Law (v = H₀*D)\n        v_recessional = h0_sample * D_mpc\n        \n        # Calculate redshift (using simple z = v/c for this exploration)\n        z_sample = v_recessional / c_kms\n        \n        # Calculate the corresponding rest-frame energy\n        E_rest_sample = E_obs_ev * (1 + z_sample)\n        estimated_rest_energies.append(E_rest_sample)\n\n    # Calculate the average result from the simulation\n    avg_E_rest = sum(estimated_rest_energies) / len(estimated_rest_energies)\n\n    print(f\"(b) Narrowing Candidates:\")\n    print(f\"Distance: {D_gpc} Gpc\")\n    print(f\"Observed Energy: {E_obs_ev:.2e} eV\")\n    print(f\"Simulated average rest-frame energy (from H₀ in [{h0_min}, {h0_max}]): {avg_E_rest:.3e} eV\")\n    print(f\"Known rest-frame energy of the 21-cm Hydrogen line: {E_21cm_rest_ev:.3e} eV\")\n    print(\"\\nThe simulated energy is extremely close to the 21-cm line energy.
