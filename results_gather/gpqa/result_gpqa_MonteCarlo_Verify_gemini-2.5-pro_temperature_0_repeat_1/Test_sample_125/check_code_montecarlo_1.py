    This function models the chemical reactions and HPLC separation to verify the answer.
    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Determine the products of Reaction I.
    2.  Determine the products of Reaction II.
    3.  Combine all products into a single list.
    4.  Count the number of unique stereoisomers for the chiral HPLC peak count.
    5.  Group the products by their behavior on a normal-phase column (where enantiomers co-elute)
        and count the groups for the normal-phase HPLC peak count.
    6.  Compare the calculated counts with the provided answer (Option C).
