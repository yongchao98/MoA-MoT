    "Based on an analysis of the reactions and chromatographic principles, the likely answer is that the combined products will show 5 peaks on a chiral HPLC column and 4 peaks on a normal-phase HPLC column. This initial hypothesis is derived by considering the stereochemical outcomes of each reaction and the separation capabilities of each HPLC technique.\n\nThis hypothesis will now be deterministically verified.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\ndef verify_hplc_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function deterministically verifies the number of HPLC peaks\n    by modeling the reaction products and applying chromatography rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # (a) Sample/Model the products from each reaction\n    # Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    # The starting material is chiral (S at C5).
