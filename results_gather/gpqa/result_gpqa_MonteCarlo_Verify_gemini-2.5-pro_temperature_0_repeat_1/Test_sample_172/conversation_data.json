    "This problem requires applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to relate the uncertainty in an electron's position to the uncertainty in its energy.\n\n1.  **Identify Principles and Formulas:**\n    *   The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for position and momentum is given by $\\Delta x \\Delta p_x \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, where $\\Delta x$ is the uncertainty in position, $\\Delta p_x$ is the uncertainty in momentum along the x-direction, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s).\n    *   We need to find the uncertainty in energy, $\\Delta E$. The relationship between energy ($E$) and momentum ($p$) is needed. For a particle with velocity $v$, the uncertainty in energy can be related to the uncertainty in momentum by $\\Delta E \\approx |\\frac{dE}{dp}| \\Delta p$.\n    *   The derivative $\\frac{dE}{dp}$ is equal to the particle's velocity, $v$. This holds for both classical ($E = p^2/2m$) and relativistic ($E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2}$) energy formulations.\n    *   Therefore, we can write $\\Delta E \\approx v \\Delta p_x$.\n\n2.  **Combine Formulas:**\n    *   From the uncertainty principle, the minimum uncertainty in momentum is $\\Delta p_x \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$.\n    *   Substituting this into the energy uncertainty relation gives: $\\Delta E \\approx v \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} \\right) = \\frac{v \\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$.\n\n3.  **Execution via Code:**\n    *   The following Python code implements this calculation.
