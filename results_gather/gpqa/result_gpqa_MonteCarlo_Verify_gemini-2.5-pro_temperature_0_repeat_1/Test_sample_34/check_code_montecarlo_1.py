    This function analyzes the physics problem to determine the correct statement
    among the given options (A, B, C, D). It then checks if this matches the
    likely answer provided by another LLM. The problem asks for the correct
    statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay = c*S,
    where c = h/(4*pi) and S is the Pauli-Y matrix.

    The function will return "Correct" if the analysis confirms that there is a
    single, unique correct answer among the options, which is assumed to be the
    answer found by the other LLM. If not, it returns a detailed explanation of the error.
