    # The most plausible reaction sequence, despite inconsistencies in the problem

    # equivalent, which then dehydrates and rearranges to the stable alkene.

    # The provided answer is "triplet of triplets" (Option C). This pattern
    # would arise from a CH proton coupled to two different CH2 groups.
