    # --- Step-by-step verification of the chemical transformations ---

    # Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane -> Product 1
    # Reagents: excess KOH, 240Â°C (strong base, high temperature).
    # Data: IR at 1720 cm-1 (ketone), 14 protons.
    # Chemical Logic: Standard substitution or elimination reactions are unlikely or forbidden (Bredt's rule).
    # The harsh conditions on a caged halide strongly suggest a skeletal rearrangement.
    # The known outcome is a quasi-Favorskii rearrangement.
    # Conclusion: Product 1 is protoadamantan-4-one. This is consistent with the formation of a ketone (IR)
    # and the retention of 14 protons.
    product_1 = "protoadamantan-4-one"

    # Step 2: Product 1 -> Product 2
    # Reagents: excess aluminum isopropoxide, heat.
    # Chemical Logic: Aluminum isopropoxide is the reagent for Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction,
    # which converts a ketone to an alcohol. The subsequent step (ozonolysis) requires an alkene.
    # Therefore, the reaction must be a reduction followed by dehydration, which is plausible under heat
    # with a Lewis acid catalyst (the aluminum species).
    # The dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol to protoadamant-4-ene is sterically allowed and does not violate Bredt's rule.
    # Conclusion: Product 2 is protoadamant-4-ene.
    product_2 = "protoadamant-4-ene"

    # Step 3: Product 2 -> Product 3
    # Reagents: O3, then DMS (reductive ozonolysis).
    # Chemical Logic: Reductive ozonolysis cleaves a C=C double bond and terminates the resulting fragments
    # with aldehydes or ketones. Here, the C4=C5 bond in protoadamant-4-ene is cleaved. Both C4 and C5
    # are methine (CH) carbons, so they will form aldehyde (-CHO) groups. This cleavage opens one of the
    # rings in the tricyclic system.
    # Conclusion: Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde.
    product_3 = "bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde"

    # --- Final Analysis: NMR of Product 3 ---
    # Question: Coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen.
    # 1. Identify the proton: The aldehyde protons (~10 ppm) are exchangeable/excluded. The next most
    #    deshielded protons are those alpha to the electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups. These are the
    #    methine protons at positions C3 and C7.
    # 2. Analyze symmetry: The molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry, making H3 and H7 chemically equivalent.
    #    We only need to analyze the neighbors of one, e.g., H3.
    # 3. Identify neighbors: H3 is on C3, which is bonded to C2 and C4. The neighbors are the protons on C2 and C4.
    # 4. Analyze neighbor equivalency:
    #    - C2 and C4 are both methylene (-CH2-) groups.
    #    - Due to the C2 symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent as a set to the two protons on C4.
    #    - However, in the rigid bicyclic system, the two protons on C2 itself (one "axial-like", one "equatorial-like")
    #      are diastereotopic and thus are NOT magnetically equivalent to each other. They will have different
    #      coupling constants (J-values) to H3.
    # 5. Determine the splitting pattern:
    #    - H3 is coupled to two equivalent protons (H2a and H4a) with one J-value, J_a.
    #    - H3 is also coupled to two other equivalent protons (H2e and H4e) with a different J-value, J_b.
    #    - Applying the (n+1) rule sequentially:
    #      - Coupling to the first pair (n=2) gives a triplet.
    #      - Each line of that triplet is then split by the second pair (n=2), resulting in another triplet.
    #    - The final pattern is a "triplet of triplets".
    
    derived_correct_pattern = "triplet of triplets"

    # Find which option corresponds to the derived correct pattern.
