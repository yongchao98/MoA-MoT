    # --- Chemical Reasoning ---

    # Part 1: Analyze the reaction sequence and identify Product 3.
    # There is a significant contradiction in the problem statement.
    # - The IR spectrum for Product 1 (1720 cm-1) and the reagent for Step 2 (aluminum isopropoxide, an agent for reducing ketones) strongly suggest Product 1 is a ketone.
    # - However, Step 3 is an ozonolysis reaction, which requires a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). A saturated ketone like adamantan-2-one (a plausible product) would not react.
    # This implies that the information about Product 1 is either flawed or intended to be misleading. For the entire reaction sequence to be possible, Product 1 MUST contain a C=C bond.

    # The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a strong base is known to produce protoadamantene via rearrangement and elimination. Let's assume this is the correct pathway, as it provides the necessary C=C bond for Step 3.
    
    # Step 1 -> Product 1 is assumed to be protoadamantene.
    # We must ignore the conflicting IR and NMR data for Product 1.
    product_1 = "protoadamantene"

    # Step 2 -> Product 2
    # Aluminum isopropoxide is a reagent for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of ketones. It does not react with an alkene.
    # Therefore, Product 2 is also protoadamantene.
    product_2 = "protoadamantene"

    # Step 3 -> Product 3
    # Ozonolysis (O3, DMS) of protoadamantene (tricyclo[4.3.1.0^3,8]dec-4-ene) cleaves the C4=C5 double bond.
    # This ring-opening reaction forms a dicarbonyl compound: bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.
    product_3 = "bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione"

    # Part 2: Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 3.
    # We need to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.
    # - The most deshielded non-exchangeable protons in this molecule are the two equivalent bridgehead protons at positions C1 and C5. They are alpha to two separate carbonyl groups across a bridge.
    # - Let's analyze the coupling for the proton at C1 (H1). It is adjacent to three methylene (CH2) groups: C2, C8, and C9.
    # - Coupling to C9-H2: A known feature of this molecule's rigid conformation is that the dihedral angles between H1 and the protons on C9 are close to 90 degrees. According to the Karplus equation, this results in a coupling constant (J) that is approximately zero. So, we can ignore coupling to the C9 protons.
    # - Coupling to C2-H2 and C8-H2: Due to the molecule's symmetry, the methylene groups at C2 and C8 are equivalent with respect to H1.
    # - The two protons on C2 (axial and equatorial) are not equivalent to each other, and the same is true for C8. However, by symmetry, the two axial protons (H2ax, H8ax) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons (H2eq, H8eq) are also equivalent to each other.
    # - Therefore, H1 is coupled to two equivalent axial protons (n=2) and two equivalent equatorial protons (n=2).
    # - According to the n+1 rule, coupling to two equivalent protons gives a triplet.
    # - H1 is split into a triplet by the two axial protons. Each peak of this triplet is then further split into a triplet by the two equatorial protons.
    # - The resulting pattern is a triplet of triplets.
    
    predicted_pattern = "triplet of triplets"

    # Part 3: Compare prediction with the given answer.

            "1. Inconsistency: The problem statement is inconsistent. The spectral data for Product 1 suggests a ketone, but the ozonolysis in Step 3 requires an alkene. The only chemically viable pathway involves the formation of an alkene.\n"
            "2. Reaction Pathway: The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with strong base produces protoadamantene (Product 1 & 2). The ketone-reducing agent in Step 2 is a distractor.\n"
            "3. Ozonolysis Product: Ozonolysis of protoadamantene yields bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione (Product 3).\n"
            "4. NMR Analysis: The most deshielded protons in Product 3 are the bridgehead protons (H1, H5). Each is coupled to two sets of two equivalent neighboring protons (the axial and equatorial protons on the adjacent methylenes), resulting in a 'triplet of triplets' splitting pattern. Coupling to the third adjacent methylene is negligible due to the molecule's geometry."
