    This function checks the correctness of the proposed reaction sequence for the synthesis of
    [1,1'-bi(cyclopentylidene)]-2-one from 1,5-dichloropentane.

    The target molecule, [1,1'-bi(cyclopentylidene)]-2-one, is more systematically named
    2-(cyclopentylidene)cyclopentan-1-one. This is the product of a self-aldol condensation
    of cyclopentanone.
