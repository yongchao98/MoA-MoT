    This function verifies the number of 13C-NMR signals for the final product
    of the given reaction sequence.

    The reaction sequence is:
    1. Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 -> 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane
    2. + BuLi -> Lithiated anion
    3. + Bromoethane -> 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane
    4. + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ -> 3-Pentanone
    5. + Wittig reagent from 3-bromopentane -> 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene

    The final product is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.
