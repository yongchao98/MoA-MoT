    "Here is the solution using randomized exploration followed by deterministic verification.\n\nThe problem asks to identify the chemical formula of a di-substituted aromatic ester based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.\n\n**Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:**\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a C6H4 core. The presence of two aromatic-H signals suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which would give two doublets.\n2.  **Ester group:** Confirmed by FTIR, this is a -COO- group.\n3.  **1H NMR Signals:**\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals, 1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring would be a doublet (split by the other vinyl H). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group would be a doublet of quartets (split by the other vinyl H and the three methyl protons).\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One methyl group is from the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The second methyl group is most simply explained as being part of the ester, forming a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`).\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint that eliminates many possible structures.\n\n**Proposed Structure:**\nBased on the analysis, the molecule consists of a benzene ring substituted with a propenyl group and a methyl carboxylate group. A plausible structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n**Formula Calculation for Proposed Structure:**\n*   Aromatic ring (C6H4): 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n*   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens\n*   Methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n*   **Total:** C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O(2) = **C11H12O2**\n\nThe following Python code will systematically evaluate the given options to verify this conclusion. It first narrows down the candidates based on the degree of unsaturation (DBE) required for the known functional groups and then performs an exact check by attempting to construct a valid molecule from fragments derived from the NMR data.\n\n```python\ndef solve_aromatic_ester_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses a systematic evaluation of candidates (exploration) followed by\n    deterministic checks to identify the correct chemical formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- (a) Sampling: Define the candidate pool from the options ---\n    # The \"randomized exploration\" is modeled by considering the provided options\n    # as a sample space to be investigated.\n    possible_formulas = {\n        \"A\": {\"C\": 11, \"H\": 14, \"O\": 2},\n        \"B\": {\"C\": 11, \"H\": 12, \"O\": 2},\n        \"C\": {\"C\": 12, \"H\": 12, \"O\": 2},\n        \"D\": {\"C\": 12, \"H\": 14, \"O\": 2},\n    }\n    print(\"--- Step (a): Sampling from possible formulas ---\")\n    print(f\"Candidate formulas: {['C'+str(v['C'])+'H'+str(v['H'])+'O'+str(v['O']) for v in possible_formulas.values()]}\\n\")\n\n    # --- (b) Narrowing Candidates: Apply deterministic rules ---\n    print(\"--- Step (b): Narrowing candidates based on Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) ---\")\n    \n    # Required features from the problem statement:\n    # 1.
