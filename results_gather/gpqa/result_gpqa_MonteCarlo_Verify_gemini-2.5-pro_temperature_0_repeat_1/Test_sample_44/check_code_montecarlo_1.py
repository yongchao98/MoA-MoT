    # --- Step 1: Define the problem constraints ---
    # For spin-1/2 particles (fermions), the Pauli Exclusion Principle applies.
    # This means each energy level 'n' can hold at most two particles
    # (one spin-up, one spin-down).

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the Ground State Energy ---
    # To find the lowest energy (ground state), we fill the lowest available
    # energy levels.
    # Level n=1 can hold 2 particles.
    # Level n=2 can hold 2 particles.
    ground_state_config = [1, 1, 2, 2]
    ground_state_energy = sum(n**2 for n in ground_state_config)

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the First Excited State Energy ---
    # The first excited state is the lowest possible energy configuration
    # above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle
    # from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.
    # Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.

    # --- Step 4: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy ---
    # The second excited state is the next lowest energy configuration. We must
    # consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state
    # and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.
    #
    # Ground state config: [1, 1, 2, 2]
    #
    # Possibility A (already found): Promote from n=2 to n=3 -> [1, 1, 2, 3]
    # Energy = 1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 1 + 4 + 9 = 15. This is the 1st excited state.
    #
    # Possibility B: Promote from n=1 to n=3 -> [1, 2, 2, 3]
    # Energy = 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 4 + 4 + 9 = 18.
    #
    # Possibility C: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3 -> [1, 1, 3, 3]
    # Energy = 1^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 1 + 9 + 9 = 20.
    #
    # Comparing the energies of the excited configurations (15, 18, 20, ...),
    # the second lowest is 18.
    second_excited_config = [1, 2, 2, 3]
