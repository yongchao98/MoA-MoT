    "An electron-positron annihilation is governed by the conservation of energy and momentum. I will first use a Monte Carlo simulation to explore the possible angles for the resulting photons that satisfy these conservation laws, identifying the most likely answer from the given options. Then, I will derive the exact analytical solution to verify the result.\n\nHere is the process:\n1.  **Initial State:** Calculate the total energy and momentum of the electron-positron system before the collision using their given Lorentz factors.\n2.  **Final State:** Model the two-photon system, noting that they have equal energy. The total energy must match the initial state. The directions of the photons are symmetric about the horizontal axis to conserve transverse momentum.\n3.  **Monte Carlo (Sampling & Narrowing):** Randomly sample the emission angle of the photons. For each sample, calculate the resulting total momentum. The angle that produces a momentum closest to the initial system's momentum is the most probable. This result is compared to the given options to find the best candidate.\n4.  **Deterministic Verification:** Solve the conservation of momentum equation analytically for the angle. This provides an exact value which is used to verify the candidate from the Monte Carlo step.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_annihilation_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the electron-positron annihilation problem using Monte Carlo exploration\n    followed by deterministic verification.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Setup based on problem statement ---\n    # We work in natural units where the electron rest mass m_e = 1 and the speed of light c = 1.\n    # In these units, Energy E = gamma and momentum p = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1).\n\n    # Initial state: electron (e) and positron (p)\n    gamma_e = 4.0\n    gamma_p = 2.0\n\n    # Total initial energy (E_i = E_e + E_p)\n    E_total_initial = gamma_e + gamma_p  # 4 + 2 = 6\n\n    # Total initial momentum (p_i = p_e + p_p)\n    # Electron moves right (+x), positron moves left (-x)\n    p_e_x = np.sqrt(gamma_e**2 - 1)  # sqrt(15)\n    p_p_x = -np.sqrt(gamma_p**2 - 1) # -sqrt(3)\n    p_total_initial_x = p_e_x + p_p_x\n\n    # Final state: 2 photons of equal energy (E_gamma)\n    # By conservation of energy: E_total_initial = 2 * E_gamma\n    E_gamma = E_total_initial / 2.0  # 6 / 2 = 3\n\n    # For a photon, momentum magnitude p = E (since c=1)\n    p_gamma = E_gamma\n\n    # The photons move at angles +theta and -theta to the x-axis to conserve y-momentum.\n    # Total final momentum in x-direction: p_f = p_gamma*cos(theta) + p_gamma*cos(-theta) = 2*p_gamma*cos(theta)\n    # p_f = 2 * 3 * cos(theta) = 6 * cos(theta)\n    # By conservation of momentum, p_i = p_f.\n    # We need to find the angle that solves: p_total_initial_x = 6 * cos(theta)\n\n    print(\"--- (a) Randomized/Monte Carlo Sampling ---\")\n    num_samples = 100000\n    best_theta_sample = None\n    min_error = float('inf')\n    target_momentum = p_total_initial_x\n\n    for _ in range(num_samples):\n        # Sample a random angle for one photon (0 to 90 degrees)\n        theta_sample = np.random.uniform(0, np.pi / 2)\n        momentum_from_sample = 6.0 * np.cos(theta_sample)\n        error = abs(momentum_from_sample - target_momentum)\n\n        if error < min_error:\n            min_error = error\n            best_theta_sample = theta_sample\n\n    # The total angle between photons is 2 * theta\n    mc_angle_deg = np.rad2deg(2 * best_theta_sample)\n\n    print(f\"Target x-momentum from initial state: {target_momentum:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Best angle from {num_samples} samples gives a total angle of: {mc_angle_deg:.4f} degrees\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- (b) Narrowing Candidates ---\")\n    options = {'A': 172, 'B': 74, 'C': 138, 'D': 96}\n    closest_option_key = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - mc_angle_deg))\n    print(f\"The Monte Carlo result is closest to option {closest_option_key}: {options[closest_option_key]} degrees.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- (c) Deterministic Verification ---\")\n    # Solve p_total_initial_x = 6 * cos(theta) for theta\n    # cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n    cos_theta_exact = (np.sqrt(15) - np.sqrt(3)) / 6.0\n    theta_exact_rad = np.arccos(cos_theta_exact)\n    total_angle_exact_deg = np.rad2deg(2 * theta_exact_rad)\n\n    print(f\"Analytically solved angle: {total_angle_exact_deg:.4f} degrees\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- (d) Final Verified Answer ---\")\n    # Check if the exact answer confirms the candidate from the MC simulation\n    if abs(total_angle_exact_deg - options[closest_option_key]) < 1.0:\n        print(f\"The exact calculation confirms the Monte Carlo result.\")\n        print(f\"The verified answer is option {closest_option_key}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Verification failed.

    "The simulation and verification process was successful. The Monte Carlo exploration pointed to option C, and the deterministic calculation confirmed this result with high precision.\n\nHere is a summary of the deterministic verification:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system is conserved. We use natural units where the electron rest mass `m_e = 1` and the speed of light `c = 1`.\n    *   Relativistic energy is given by `E = γ * m_e * c^2`, which simplifies to `E = γ`.\n    *   Initial Energy (Electron + Positron): `E_initial = γ_electron + γ_positron = 4 + 2 = 6`.\n    *   After annihilation, two photons of equal energy `E_photon` are produced.\n    *   Final Energy: `E_final = 2 * E_photon`.\n    *   By conservation, `E_initial = E_final`, so `6 = 2 * E_photon`, which means each photon has an energy `E_photon = 3`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system is also conserved.\n    *   Relativistic momentum is `p = sqrt(γ^2 - 1)`.\n    *   Initial Momentum (along the x-axis):\n        *   Electron (moving right): `p_electron = +sqrt(4^2 - 1) = +sqrt(15)`.\n        *   Positron (moving left): `p_positron = -sqrt(2^2 - 1) = -sqrt(3)`.\n        *   Total Initial Momentum: `p_initial = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 2.141`.\n    *   Final Momentum:\n        *   For a photon, momentum `p = E`, so each photon has a momentum magnitude of `p_photon = 3`.\n        *   To conserve momentum in the transverse (up/down) direction, the photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles `+θ` and `-θ` relative to the horizontal axis.\n        *   The total final momentum in the x-direction is `p_final = p_photon * cos(θ) + p_photon * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_photon * cos(θ) = 6 * cos(θ)`.\n\n3.  **Solving for the Angle:**\n    *   Equating initial and final momentum: `p_initial = p_final`.\n    *   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`.\n    *   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 ≈ 0.3568`.\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2 * θ`.\n    *   Total Angle = `2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`.\n\nThis value is extremely close to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
