    # Attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen (now -OH) remains on C1.
    # The product is a cyclohexanol. The carbon with the -OH is designated as new C1.
    # Therefore, old C1 becomes new C1.
    # To give substituents the lowest locants, we number towards the original C6.

    # new C1 <- old C1
    # new C2 <- old C6 (site of Me addition)
    # new C4 <- old C4
    # new C5 <- old C3
    
    # The product has methyl groups at new C1 (original), new C2 (from Me2CuLi),
    # new C4 (original), and new C5 (original).
    # This confirms the base name is "1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol".

    # that would arise from an attack at C1.
