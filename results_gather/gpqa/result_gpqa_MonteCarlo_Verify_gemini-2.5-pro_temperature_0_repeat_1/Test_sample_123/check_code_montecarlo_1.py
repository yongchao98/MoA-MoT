    # The fraction of surviving particles 'f' is given by f = exp(-t / (gamma * tau)),
    # where t is the time in the lab frame, gamma is the Lorentz factor, and tau is the proper lifetime.
    # Taking the natural log: ln(f) = -t / (gamma * tau).
    # Rearranging gives: gamma * ln(f) = -t / tau.
    # Since t (time of flight to the detector wall) and tau (proper lifetime) are constant
    # across both scenarios, the product gamma * ln(f) must be constant.
    # Therefore, gamma_1 * ln(f_1) = gamma_2 * ln(f_2).
