    # The fundamental identity for abundance calculations is: [X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H]
    # This is derived from the definition [X/Y] = log10( (nX/nY)_star ) - log10( (nX/nY)_sun )
    
    # For Star 1, we calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio, [Si/H]_1.
    # Using the identity with X=Si, Y=Fe:
    # [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1
    Si_H_1 = Si_Fe_1 + Fe_H_1
    
    # For Star 2, we calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio, [Si/H]_2.
    # We are given values involving Mg, Si, and H. The identity is [Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2.
    # We rearrange it to solve for [Si/H]_2:
    # [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2
    Si_H_2 = Mg_H_2 - Mg_Si_2
    
    # The question asks for the ratio R = (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2.
    # Taking the logarithm of the ratio: log10(R) = log10((n_Si/n_H)_1) - log10((n_Si/n_H)_2).
    # From the definition of [X/H], we know log10(n_X/n_H)_star = [X/H]_star + log10(n_X/n_H)_sun.
    # When we subtract the log abundances, the solar abundance term cancels out:
    # log10(R) = ([Si/H]_1 + C) - ([Si/H]_2 + C) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2
