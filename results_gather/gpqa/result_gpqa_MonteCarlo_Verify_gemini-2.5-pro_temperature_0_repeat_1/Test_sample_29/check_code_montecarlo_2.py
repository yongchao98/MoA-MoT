def check_dye_color_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the textile dye color question.

    The question states a dye EMITS light with a specific energy. This implies
    fluorescence. The key physical principle is the Stokes Shift, which dictates
    that the absorbed light must have higher energy (and thus a shorter wavelength)
    than the emitted light.

    The code will:
    1. Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light from the given energy.
    2. Determine the color of the emitted light.
    3. Check if the provided answer ('A' -> 'Blue') corresponds to a color
       with a shorter wavelength than the emitted light.
    4. Verify that other options with longer wavelengths are correctly identified
       as impossible.
