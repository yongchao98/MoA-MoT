    "The user wants to determine the color of light absorbed by a dye, given the energy of the light it emits.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics:** The process described is fluorescence. A molecule absorbs a photon of a certain energy (E_absorbed) to get to an excited state. It then loses a small amount of energy non-radiatively (e.g., as heat/vibrations) before emitting a photon of a lower energy (E_emitted) to return to the ground state. This phenomenon is known as the **Stokes Shift**.\n    *   The key principle is: **E_absorbed > E_emitted**.\n    *   Since energy (E) and wavelength (λ) are inversely related (E = hc/λ), this means **λ_absorbed < λ_emitted**. The absorbed light must have a shorter wavelength than the emitted light.\n\n2.  **Calculate Emitted Wavelength/Color:**\n    *   The energy of the emitted light is given as E_emitted = 2.3393 eV.\n    *   Using the formula λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV), we can find the wavelength of the emitted light:\n        λ_emitted ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530.07 nm.\n    *   A wavelength of ~530 nm corresponds to **green** light in the visible spectrum.\n\n3.  **Determine Absorbed Color:**\n    *   Based on the Stokes Shift, the absorbed light must have a higher energy and shorter wavelength than the emitted green light (λ < 530 nm).\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        *   C) Red (~620–750 nm) and D) Yellow (~570–590 nm) have longer wavelengths than green light. They are physically impossible as the cause of this fluorescence.\n        *   A) Blue (~450–495 nm) and B) Violet (~380–450 nm) have shorter wavelengths and are therefore physically possible.\n    *   However, the absorption and emission bands for a fluorescent dye are typically adjacent. A dye that emits green light most commonly absorbs light in the neighboring higher-energy region, which is blue. A large jump from violet absorption to green emission (a large Stokes shift) is less common for typical dyes.\n\n4.  **Strategy:**\n    *   **Randomized Exploration:** We can simulate the process by taking the emitted energy (2.3393 eV) and adding a small, random positive value to represent the Stokes shift. We'll then check which color corresponds to this simulated absorbed energy. Repeating this many times will show which color is the most probable candidate.\n    *   **Deterministic Verification:** We will calculate the energy ranges for each color option and systematically check which ones satisfy the E_absorbed > 2.3393 eV rule. This will eliminate Red and Yellow. We will then use the principle of typical Stokes shifts to select the most plausible option between the remaining candidates.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef solve_dye_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses Monte Carlo simulation and deterministic checks to find the absorbed color.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- (a) Sampling / Monte Carlo Exploration ---\n\n    # Define color ranges in electron-volts (eV).
