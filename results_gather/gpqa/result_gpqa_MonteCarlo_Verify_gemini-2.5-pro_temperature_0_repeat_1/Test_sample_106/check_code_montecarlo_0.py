It provides real-world evidence of which molecular forms are biologically active, allowing the computationally expensive docking studies to be focused on the most promising candidates. This directly and most reliably addresses the core problem of having too many forms to test.",
        "B": "This is incorrect because it relies on the 'most stable form' fallacy. The most stable form of a molecule in isolation is often not the bioactive conformation that binds to the protein target. This is a well-known pitfall that can cause the entire study to fail.",
        "C": "This is incorrect because it's out of sequence. ADME/PK studies are crucial but are performed later in the drug discovery pipeline, typically after a compound has been confirmed as a 'hit' (i.e., it binds to the target). The docking study's purpose is to find that initial hit.",
        "D": "This is a plausible but suboptimal strategy. While using physicochemical properties to filter candidates is a valid computational step, it is still purely predictive and less reliable than using direct experimental evidence as proposed in option A. Therefore, it is not the *most crucial* step when experimental validation is an option."
