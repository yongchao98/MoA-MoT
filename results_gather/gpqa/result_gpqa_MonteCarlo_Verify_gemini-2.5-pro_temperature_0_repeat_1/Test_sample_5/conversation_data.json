    "Answering this quantum mechanics problem requires finding the energy spectrum for a particle in a given 2D potential. The standard method is to express the potential in a coordinate system where the Schrödinger equation becomes separable.\n\n1.  **Randomized/Monte Carlo Exploration (Hypothesis Generation):**\n    The potential `V(r, θ)` is anisotropic due to the `cos^2(θ)` term, which favors the x-axis (`θ=0, π`). This suggests that if we switch to Cartesian coordinates, we might get a separable potential of two different harmonic oscillators, one in `x` and one in `y`. The energy spectrum would then be `E = E_x + E_y = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y`.\n\n    The options provided are:\n    A) `E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))`\n    B) `E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)`\n    C) `E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))`\n    D) `E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))`\n\n    Let's assume `ω_0 = sqrt(k/m)`. The general energy form is `E = (A*n_x + B*n_y + (A+B)/2)ħω_0`, where `ω_x = A*ω_0` and `ω_y = B*ω_0`.\n    *   Option B: `(2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħω_0`. Here, `A=2` and `B=1`. The ground state energy term `(A+B)/2 = (2+1)/2 = 3/2` matches. This suggests `ω_x = 2ω_0` and `ω_y = ω_0`. This is a plausible hypothesis.\n    *   Option C: `(n_x + 3n_y + 2)ħω_0`. Here `A=1, B=3`. The ground state term `(A+B)/2 = (1+3)/2 = 2` matches. This suggests `ω_x = ω_0` and `ω_y = 3ω_0`.\n    *   Options A and D do not fit the standard `(n+1/2)` structure for the ground state energy.\n\n    Our \"random\" exploration has narrowed the likely candidates to B and C. We will now deterministically verify which one is correct.\n\n2.  **Deterministic Verification:**\n    The script below will perform the verification by converting the potential to Cartesian coordinates, identifying the effective harmonic oscillator frequencies, and calculating the resulting energy spectrum.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_quantum_potential():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the energy spectrum problem by:\n    (a) Stating the candidate hypotheses based on the problem's structure.\n    (b) Converting the potential from polar to Cartesian coordinates.\n    (c) Running an exact check by deriving the oscillator frequencies and total energy.\n    (d) Printing the final verified answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # (a) Sampling / Hypothesis Generation\n    # The potential V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ) is anisotropic.\n    # We hypothesize it separates in Cartesian coordinates into two harmonic oscillators.\n    # The energy would be E = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y.\n    # Let's test the hypothesis that ω_x and ω_y are integer multiples of sqrt(k/m).\n    # Option B: E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m) suggests ω_x=2*sqrt(k/m), ω_y=1*sqrt(k/m).\n    # This is our primary candidate to verify.\n    print(\"Step (a): Proposing a hypothesis based on the structure of the options.\")\n    print(\"Candidate Hypothesis (from Option B): The potential separates into two harmonic oscillators with frequencies ω_x = 2*sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m).\\n\")\n\n    # (b) Narrowing Candidates / Analytical Derivation\n    # Define symbolic variables\n    r, theta, x, y, k, m, hbar = sympy.symbols('r theta x y k m hbar', real=True, positive=True)\n    n_x, n_y = sympy.symbols('n_x n_y', integer=True, nonneg=True)\n\n    # Original potential in polar coordinates\n    V_polar = (1/2) * k * r**2 + (3/2) * k * r**2 * sympy.cos(theta)**2\n    print(f\"Step (b): Converting potential to Cartesian coordinates.\")\n    print(f\"Original Potential V(r,θ): {V_polar}\")\n\n    # Transformation rules to Cartesian coordinates\n    # r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n    # x = r*cos(θ) => cos(θ) = x/r\n    V_cartesian = V_polar.subs({\n        r**2: x**2 + y**2,\n        sympy.cos(theta): x / sympy.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)\n    })\n\n    # Simplify the expression\n    V_cartesian_simplified = sympy.simplify(V_cartesian)\n    print(f\"Potential in Cartesian V(x,y): {V_cartesian_simplified}\\n\")\n\n    # (c) Exact Checks\n    # The simplified potential is V(x,y) = 2*k*x**2 + 1/2*k*y**2\n    # This is a sum of two 1D harmonic oscillator potentials: V(x,y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    # V_x(x) = 2*k*x**2 = 1/2 * (4*k) * x**2\n    # V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y**2\n    # The standard form is V(z) = 1/2 * K * z^2, where ω = sqrt(K/m)\n    k_x = 4 * k\n    k_y = k\n    \n    omega_x = sympy.sqrt(k_x / m)\n    omega_y = sympy.sqrt(k_y / m)\n\n    print(\"Step (c): Running exact checks.\")\n    print(f\"Effective spring constant in x: k_x = {k_x}\")\n    print(f\"Effective spring constant in y: k_y = {k_y}\")\n    print(f\"Angular frequency in x: ω_x = {omega_x}\")\n    print(f\"Angular frequency in y: ω_y = {omega_y}\\n\")\n\n    # The energy for a 1D QHO is E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω\n    E_x = (n_x + sympy.Rational(1, 2)) * hbar * omega_x\n    E_y = (n_y + sympy.Rational(1, 2)) * hbar * omega_y\n    E_total = sympy.simplify(E_x + E_y)\n\n    # Factor out the common term for comparison with options\n    E_total_factored = sympy.factor(E_total, hbar * sympy.sqrt(k/m))\n    \n    print(\"Derived Energy Spectrum:\")\n    print(f\"E_x = {E_x}\")\n    print(f\"E_y = {E_y}\")\n    print(f\"E_total = E_x + E_y = {E_total}\")\n    print(f\"Factored form E_total = {E_total_factored}\\n\")\n\n    # (d) Print Final Verified Answer\n    # Compare with the options\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (3*n_x + 2*n_y + sympy.Rational(1, 2)) * hbar * sympy.sqrt(k/m),\n        \"B\": (2*n_x + n_y + sympy.Rational(3, 2)) * hbar * sympy.sqrt(k/m),\n        \"C\": (n_x + 3*n_y + sympy.Rational(3, 2)) * hbar * sympy.sqrt(k/m),\n        \"D\": (2*n_x + 3*n_y + sympy.Rational(1, 2)) * hbar * sympy.sqrt(k/m)\n    }\n\n    verified_answer = None\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        # We need to expand our derived answer to compare\n        if sympy.simplify(E_total_factored - value) == 0:\n            verified_answer = key\n            break\n    \n    print(\"Step (d): Final Verification.\")\n    if verified_answer:\n        print(f\"The derived energy spectrum matches option {verified_answer}.\")\n        print(f\"Final Answer: {options[verified_answer]}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The derived energy spectrum does not match any of the given options.\")\n\n# Run the solver\nsolve_quantum_potential()\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
