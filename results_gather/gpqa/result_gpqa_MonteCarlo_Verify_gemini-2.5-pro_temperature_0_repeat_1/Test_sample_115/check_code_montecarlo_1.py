    # --- Constraint 1: Product Connectivity ---
    # The Diels-Alder reaction between a 4-carbon diene (part of the pentadienol)
    # and a 2-carbon dienophile (but-2-ene) forms a 6-membered ring.
    # Substituents:
    # - From diene: -OH at C1, -CH3 at C4.
    # - From dienophile: -CH3 at C5, -CH3 at C6.
    # The resulting structure is a 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol.
    # Any option not matching this connectivity is incorrect.

    # --- Constraint 2: Product Stereochemistry ---
    # The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific. The stereochemistry of the
    # dienophile is retained in the product.
    # The dienophile is the *cis*-isomer of but-2-ene.
    # Therefore, the two methyl groups it provides (at C5 and C6 of the product)
    # must be *cis* to each other on the final ring.
    # For adjacent stereocenters, a *cis* relationship corresponds to opposite
    # R/S descriptors (e.g., R,S or S,R).
    # A *trans* relationship corresponds to the same R/S descriptors (e.g., R,R or S,S).
