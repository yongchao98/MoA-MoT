    # --- Step 1: Verification of Compound A ---
    # Constraint: 6H triplet, 4H quartet. Alkane shifts.
    # Analysis: This corresponds to two equivalent ethyl groups in an alkane.
    # The structure CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3 (n-butane) fits perfectly.
    # - The two CH3 groups (6H) are adjacent to a CH2 (2H), giving a triplet (2+1=3).
    # - The two CH2 groups (4H) are adjacent to a CH3 (3H), giving a quartet (3+1=4).
    # Conclusion: Compound A is correctly identified as n-butane.
    
    # --- Step 2: Verification of Compound B ---
    # Constraint: Monobromination of n-butane.
    # Analysis: Free-radical bromination is selective for the most stable radical.
    # A secondary radical (at C2/C3) is more stable than a primary radical (at C1/C4).
    # Conclusion: The major product B is correctly identified as 2-bromobutane.

    # --- Step 3: Verification of Compound C ---
    # Constraint: Reaction of 2-bromobutane with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers.
    # Analysis: This is an E2 elimination. Zaitsev's rule favors the more substituted alkene.
    # The major product is but-2-ene. But-2-ene has cis and trans isomers.
    # Conclusion: Compound C is correctly identified as but-2-ene.

    # --- Step 4: Verification of Compound D ---
    # Reaction: Diels-Alder between cis-but-2-ene and (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.

    # that the two methyl groups it contributes (at C5 and C6) must be cis to each other in the product.
    # In IUPAC nomenclature for adjacent ring substituents:
    # - A cis relationship is typically denoted by opposite stereodescriptors (R,S or S,R).
    # - A trans relationship is typically denoted by the same stereodescriptors (R,R or S,S).

    # Check Option B: (1S,4R,5S,6S)-...
