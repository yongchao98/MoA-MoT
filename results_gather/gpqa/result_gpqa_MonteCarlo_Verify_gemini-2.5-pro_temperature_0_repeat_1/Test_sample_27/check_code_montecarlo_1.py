    # Step 2: Tandem 1,4-addition (Ph2CuLi) and alkylation (BnBr).
    # Rule 1: Phenyl group adds anti to the bulky C4-OTBS group.
    # C4(S) substituent forces the C3-Ph to be (R).
    current_stereo['C3'] = 'R'
    # Rule 2: Benzyl group adds anti to the bulky C3-Ph group.
    # C3(R) substituent forces the C2-Bn to be (S).

    # At this point, the predicted stereochemistry of the core is (2S, 3R, 4S).
    # Let's check which options are consistent with the C3 and C4 stereocenters,
    # as these are not affected by the subsequent methylation at C2.

    # Step 3: Methylation with LDA and CH3I.
    # The LLM's reasoning posits that methylation occurs at C2 due to the higher acidity of the C2 proton,
    # which is a plausible scenario. This process inverts the stereocenter at C2.
