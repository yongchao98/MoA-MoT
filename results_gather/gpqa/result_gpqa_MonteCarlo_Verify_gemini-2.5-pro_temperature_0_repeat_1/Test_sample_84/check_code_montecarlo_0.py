    # --- Step 1: Verify the formula for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures ---
    # The equilibrium temperature T_eq is given by: T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))
    # where T_star is the star's temperature, A is the albedo, R_star is the star's radius,
    # and 'a' is the semi-major axis.
    # The ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is:
    # [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]
    # The problem states T_star, R_star, and albedo (A) are the same for both.
    # Thus, the ratio simplifies to: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1).
    # This simplification is correct. The core of the problem is to find sqrt(a2 / a1).

    # --- Step 2: Verify the formula for the ratio of semi-major axes ---
    # The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a circular orbit is:
    # K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)  (assuming M_p << M_star and sin(i)≈1 or is constant)
    # Solving for 'a': a ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)
    # The ratio a2 / a1 is:
    # a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]
    # The constants G and M_star cancel out, leading to:
    # a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2
