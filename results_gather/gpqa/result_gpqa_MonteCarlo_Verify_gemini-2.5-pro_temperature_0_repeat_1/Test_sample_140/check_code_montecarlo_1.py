    # --- Pathway 1: Abstraction of Deuteron from C2 ---
    # The strong base (NH2-) can abstract the deuteron (D) from C2, which is ortho to the bromine at C1.
    # This leads to the elimination of HBr (conceptually, D+ and Br-).
    # The resulting intermediate is a standard, non-deuterated benzyne, as the deuterium is removed.
    # The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C2.
    
    # The nucleophile (NH2-) then attacks this benzyne.
    # Since the benzyne is symmetrical, attack at C1 or C2 leads to the same product after protonation.
    # Product 1: Aniline (C6H5NH2)
    final_products.add("Aniline")

    # --- Pathway 2: Abstraction of Proton from C6 ---
    # The base can also abstract a proton (H) from C6, the other ortho position.
    # This is kinetically favored over C-D bond cleavage.
    # This leads to the elimination of HBr.
    # The resulting intermediate is a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C6.
    # The deuterium at C2 remains on the ring. This is 3-deuteriobenzyne.

    # The nucleophile (NH2-) attacks this asymmetric benzyne. There are two possible outcomes:

    # Sub-pathway 2a: Attack at C1
    # - The -NH2 group attaches to C1.
    # - The resulting anion at C6 is protonated by the ammonia solvent.
    # - The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2.
    # Product 2: 2-Deuterioaniline
    final_products.add("2-Deuterioaniline")

    # Sub-pathway 2b: Attack at C6
    # - The -NH2 group attaches to C6.
    # - The resulting anion at C1 is protonated.
    # - The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2.
    # - To name this compound using IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -NH2 group is numbered C1.
    #   Therefore, the original C2 (with the deuterium) is now at position C3 relative to the -NH2 group.
    # Product 3: 3-Deuterioaniline
