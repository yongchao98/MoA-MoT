    "Answering this question requires analyzing the chemical structures of four compounds to determine their properties regarding tautomerism and optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Tautomerism Analysis (Compound A):** Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen on an sp³-hybridized carbon).\n    *   **Benzoquinone:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of C=C double bonds (sp² hybridized). It lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon, so it does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The carbons between the carbonyl groups are CH₂ groups (sp³ hybridized). These contain acidic alpha-hydrogens, allowing the compound to tautomerize into its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol. Thus, it shows tautomerism.\n    *   Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n2.  **Optical Isomerism Analysis (Compound B):** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This is most commonly due to a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃). This makes C2 a chiral center, and the molecule is chiral. Thus, it will show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is a *trans*-alkene. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers. Thus, it will not show optical isomerism.\n    *   Therefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining these findings, A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef analyze_compounds():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates a randomized exploration and deterministic verification\n    to answer the chemistry question.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": {\"A\": \"benzoquinone\", \"B\": \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\"},\n        \"B\": {\"A\": \"benzoquinone\", \"B\": \"dimethyl fumarate\"},\n        \"C\": {\"A\": \"cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione\", \"B\": \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\"},\n        \"D\": {\"A\": \"cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione\", \"B\": \"dimethyl fumarate\"},\n    }\n\n    # (a) Sample: Randomly select candidate answers to check.\n    candidate_keys = list(options.keys())\n    random.shuffle(candidate_keys)\n    print(f\"Randomized exploration order: {candidate_keys}\\n\")\n\n    # (b) Narrow candidates: Iterate through shuffled options and check against rules.\n    verified_answer = None\n    for key in candidate_keys:\n        candidate = options[key]\n        print(f\"--- Checking candidate {key} ---\")\n        \n        # (c) Run exact checks\n        # Check for A: Compound that does NOT show tautomerism.\n        # Benzoquinone: No sp3 alpha-hydrogens -> No tautomerism.
