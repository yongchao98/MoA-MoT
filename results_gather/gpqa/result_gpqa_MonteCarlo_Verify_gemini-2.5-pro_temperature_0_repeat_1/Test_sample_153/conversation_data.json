    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) to deduce the structure of the unknown compound from the given options.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   A molecular ion (M⁺) peak at m/z = 156 suggests the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotopes is 156 g/mol.\n    *   The M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% (relative to the M⁺ peak at 100%) is a classic isotopic signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom. The natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl is approximately 3:1, which matches the observed 100:32 ratio.\n    *   All four options (C₇H₅ClO₂) have a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, consistent with this finding.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, broadened by strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, and its position is consistent with that of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This evidence strongly points to the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. This eliminates option A (Phenyl chloroformate) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde). We are left with options B and D.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm integrating to 1H is a textbook signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**), further confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The aromatic region shows two doublets: one at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another at 7.72 ppm (2H). This simple A₂B₂ splitting pattern (two signals, each representing two equivalent protons) is indicative of a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring.\n    *   Comparing the remaining options:\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *para*-substituted. Due to symmetry, there are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are equivalent and would appear as a downfield doublet. The two protons ortho to the chlorine atom are also equivalent and would appear as another doublet. This perfectly matches the observed NMR data.\n        *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *ortho*-substituted. It has four non-equivalent aromatic protons, which would produce a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four distinct multiplets), not two simple doublets of 2H each.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOnly 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B) is consistent with all three pieces of spectral data. The following Python code simulates this deductive process by \"sampling\" each candidate and verifying it against the experimental evidence.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef analyze_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes chemical candidates against spectral data to identify an unknown compound.\n    (a) Samples from a list of candidates.\n    (b) Narrows candidates based on spectral features.\n    (c) Runs exact checks for verification.\n    (d) Prints the final verified answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the candidates and their key structural features for spectral prediction\n    candidates = {\n        \"A\": {\"name\": \"Phenyl chloroformate\", \"mw\": 156.57, \"has_cl\": True, \"has_cooh\": False, \"aromatic_pattern\": \"mono\"},\n        \"B\": {\"name\": \"4-chlorobenzoic acid\", \"mw\": 156.57, \"has_cl\": True, \"has_cooh\": True, \"aromatic_pattern\": \"para\"},\n        \"C\": {\"name\": \"3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\", \"mw\": 156.57, \"has_cl\": True, \"has_cooh\": False, \"aromatic_pattern\": \"tri\"},\n        \"D\": {\"name\": \"2-chlorobenzoic acid\", \"mw\": 156.57, \"has_cl\": True, \"has_cooh\": True, \"aromatic_pattern\": \"ortho\"},\n    }\n\n    # (a) Sample: We will check all candidates.
