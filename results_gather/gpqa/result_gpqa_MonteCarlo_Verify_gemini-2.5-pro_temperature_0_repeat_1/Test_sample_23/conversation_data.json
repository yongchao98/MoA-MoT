    "The user has confirmed that the previous output is correct. The final step is to provide the answer in the requested format.\n\nThe deterministic verification confirmed the following:\n1.  Hydrocarbon Z is Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n2.  Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of Benzene (C6H6) and Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n3.  Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two C6 unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons that hydrogenate to Cyclohexane. The total atom count must match that of mixture Y (C12H18). The only pair that fits all criteria (non-conjugated, decolorizes bromine water, correct atom count) is Cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\n-   Hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10): 10\n-   Hydrogen atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8): 8\n-   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
