def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the molecular biology question.

    The function validates the answer based on the following biological principles
    derived from the question:
    1. A "dominant-negative" mutation is a type of loss-of-function, not gain-of-function or wild-type.
    2. The mechanism must involve the mutant protein interfering with the wild-type protein, which requires interaction (e.g., dimerization).
    3. Between plausible mechanisms, the most direct molecular consequence of a missense mutation (misfolding -> aggregation) is considered more likely than a secondary cellular response (misfolding -> degradation).
