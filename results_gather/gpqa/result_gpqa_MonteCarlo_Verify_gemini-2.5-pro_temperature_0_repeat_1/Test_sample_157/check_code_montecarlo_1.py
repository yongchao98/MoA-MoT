    """
    This function checks the correctness of an answer to a specific biology question
    by encoding the logical constraints of the question.

    Question Summary:
    - A transcription factor must dimerize to function.
    - A heterozygous mutation Y is in the dimerization domain.
    - Mutation Y acts as a dominant-negative mutation.
    - Question: What is the most likely molecular phenotype?
    """

    # --- Step 1: Define the core concepts from the question ---
    # A "dominant-negative" mutation has two key features:
    # 1. It results in a loss-of-function phenotype at the cellular/organismal level.
    # 2. The mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein.
    
    # The mutation is in the "dimerization domain", so the interference mechanism
    # must be related to the formation of dimers. The mutant protein forms
    # non-functional heterodimers with the wild-type protein.

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the options based on these rules ---

                       "The mechanism, 'protein aggregation', is a classic consequence of missense mutations in interaction domains (like dimerization domains). "
                       "The formation of misfolded, non-functional heterodimers (mutant + wild-type) often leads to aggregation, which sequesters and inactivates the wild-type protein, thus explaining the dominant-negative effect.")
