    "To solve this problem, we will first use a randomized simulation to propose the likely products and then deterministically verify the stereochemical outcomes and their chromatographic behavior.\n\n### Analysis Steps:\n1.  **Reaction 1 Analysis**: Determine the stereochemical outcome of the two-step reaction starting with (E)-oct-4-ene.\n    *   Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   Step 2: Acid-catalyzed epoxide ring-opening is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   The overall transformation is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n2.  **Reaction 2 Analysis**: Determine the stereochemical outcome of the two-step reaction starting with (Z)-oct-4-ene, following the same reaction sequence.\n3.  **Product Mixture**: Identify all the unique stereoisomers present in the combined product mixture.\n4.  **HPLC Prediction**:\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC**: Predict the number of peaks. This technique separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC**: Predict the number of peaks. This technique separates both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\nThe Python code below will simulate these steps, verify the results deterministically, and provide the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the stereochemistry and chromatography problem by simulating the reactions,\n    verifying the products, and predicting the number of HPLC peaks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- (a) Sampling / Monte Carlo Exploration ---\n\n    # Define the possible stereoisomers of the final product, octane-4,5-diol.\n    # There are three: a pair of enantiomers (R,R and S,S) and a meso compound (R,S).\n    R_DIOL = \"(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\"\n    S_DIOL = \"(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\"\n    MESO_DIOL = \"meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\"\n\n    # Define stereochemical relationships for HPLC simulation\n    ENANTIOMERS = {R_DIOL: S_DIOL, S_DIOL: R_DIOL}\n\n    def simulate_reaction_1():\n        \"\"\"Simulates Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene -> mCPBA -> H3O+\"\"\"\n        # The overall reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene.\n        # Stereochemical rule: trans-alkene + anti-addition -> meso product.\n        # The simulation will always yield the meso compound.\n        return MESO_DIOL\n\n    def simulate_reaction_2():\n        \"\"\"Simulates Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene -> mCPBA -> H3O+\"\"\"\n        # The overall reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene.\n        # Stereochemical rule: cis-alkene + anti-addition -> racemic mixture (enantiomers).\n        # We simulate the formation of a racemic mixture by randomly choosing one enantiomer.\n        # Over many simulations, this represents a 1:1 mixture.\n        return random.choice([R_DIOL, S_DIOL])\n\n    # Run simulations to find the likely set of products\n    num_simulations = 100\n    products_r1 = [simulate_reaction_1() for _ in range(num_simulations)]\n    products_r2 = [simulate_reaction_2() for _ in range(num_simulations)]\n    total_products = products_r1 + products_r2\n\n    # --- (b) Narrowing Candidates ---\n\n    # Identify the unique products formed in the combined mixture from the simulation.\n    candidate_products = set(total_products)\n\n    # --- (c) Exact Checks / Deterministic Verification ---\n\n    # Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) undergoes anti-dihydroxylation to yield a meso compound.\n    verified_products_1 = {MESO_DIOL}\n\n    # Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) undergoes anti-dihydroxylation to yield a racemic mixture.\n    verified_products_2 = {R_DIOL, S_DIOL}\n\n    # The final combined mixture contains all three stereoisomers.\n    final_mixture_components = verified_products_1.union(verified_products_2)\n\n    # Verify that the simulation correctly identified all products.\n    if candidate_products != final_mixture_components:\n        print(\"Error: Simulation did not match deterministic verification.\")\n        return\n\n    # Determine the number of peaks for each HPLC type.\n\n    # 1.
