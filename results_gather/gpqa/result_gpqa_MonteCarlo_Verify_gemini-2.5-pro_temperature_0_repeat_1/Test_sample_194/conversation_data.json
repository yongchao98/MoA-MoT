    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Conditions\n\n*   **Transit and Occultation:** For a planet to exhibit both a transit (passing in front of the star) and an occultation (passing behind the star), its orbit must be inclined such that its path, as seen from Earth, crosses the disk of the star.\n*   **Impact Parameter (b):** The impact parameter is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at mid-transit, normalized by the star's radius (`R_s`). It's given by `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`, where `a` is the semi-major axis and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n*   **The Limiting Condition:** A transit/occultation event will occur as long as the center of the planet passes over the star's disk. The limiting case for this is when the planet's center grazes the edge of the star's disk. This corresponds to an impact parameter `b = 1`. If `b > 1`, the planet's path misses the star's disk entirely. Therefore, the condition for Planet 2 to have both events is `b_2 <= 1`.\n\n### 2. Relating the Two Planets\n\n*   We are given that both planets share the same orbital plane, which means they have the same inclination `i`. The star's radius `R_s` is also the same for both.\n*   For Planet 1: `b_1 = (a_1 * cos(i)) / R_s = 0.2`\n*   For Planet 2: `b_2 = (a_2 * cos(i)) / R_s`\n*   By taking the ratio of these two equations, we can eliminate the unknown terms `cos(i)` and `R_s`:\n    `b_2 / b_1 = a_2 / a_1`\n\n### 3. Applying Kepler's Third Law\n\n*   Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`): `P^2 ∝ a^3`.\n*   This gives us the relationship: `(P_2 / P_1)^2 = (a_2 / a_1)^3`.\n*   We can rearrange this to express the ratio of semi-major axes in terms of the periods: `a_2 / a_1 = (P_2 / P_1)^(2/3)`.\n\n### 4. Finding the Maximum Period for Planet 2\n\n*   Substitute the expression from Kepler's Law into the impact parameter ratio:\n    `b_2 / b_1 = (P_2 / P_1)^(2/3)`\n*   This gives us a direct relationship between the impact parameter and orbital period of Planet 2:\n    `b_2 = b_1 * (P_2 / P_1)^(2/3)`\n*   We want to find the maximum period for Planet 2, `P_{2,max}`. This will occur at the maximum allowed impact parameter, which is `b_2 = 1`.\n    `1 = b_1 * (P_{2,max} / P_1)^(2/3)`\n*   Now, we solve for `P_{2,max}`:\n    *   `1 / b_1 = (P_{2,max} / P_1)^(2/3)`\n    *   `(1 / b_1)^(3/2) = P_{2,max} / P_1`\n    *   `P_{2,max} = P_1 * (1 / b_1)^(3/2)`\n\n### 5. Calculation\n\n*   Plug in the given values: `P_1 = 3` days and `b_1 = 0.2`.\n*   `P_{2,max} = 3 * (1 / 0.2)^(3/2)`\n*   `P_{2,max} = 3 * (5)^(1.5)`\n*   `P_{2,max} = 3 * 11.1803...`\n*   `P_{2,max} ≈ 33.54` days.\n\nThis value is extremely close to option D. The radii of the planets and the star were not needed for this calculation, as the limiting condition `b <= 1` is independent of the planet's size.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic, starting with a randomized exploration and finishing with the deterministic verification.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# This code solves for the maximum orbital period of a second planet\n# that can be observed in both transit and occultation.\n\n# (a) Randomized Sampling\n# Define the known parameters for Planet 1.\nP1_days = 3.0\nb1 = 0.2\n\n# Create a large number of random samples for the period of Planet 2 (P2)\n# to explore the possible outcomes.\nnum_samples = 1000000\n# We sample from a range that likely includes the answer.\nsampled_P2 = np.random.uniform(low=1.0, high=50.0, size=num_samples)\n\n# (b) Narrowing Candidates\n# The condition for both transit and occultation events is that the planet's\n# center must pass over the stellar disk, meaning its impact parameter b2 <= 1.\n# We can relate b2 to P2 using Kepler's Third Law and the definition of b.\n# b2 = b1 * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)\nratio_P2_over_P1 = sampled_P2 / P1_days\nsampled_b2 = b1 * (ratio_P2_over_P1)**(2.0/3.0)\n\n# Filter the samples to keep only those that satisfy the condition b2 <= 1.\ncandidate_P2 = sampled_P2[sampled_b2 <= 1]\n\n# The maximum value from the valid candidates gives a likely answer.\nif candidate_P2.size > 0:\n    likely_max_P2 = np.max(candidate_P2)\n    print(f\"Monte Carlo step: Found {len(candidate_P2)} valid samples.\")\n    print(f\"Likely maximum period from sampling: ~{likely_max_P2:.2f} days.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Monte Carlo step: No valid candidates found in the sampled range.\")\n\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# (c) Running Exact Checks\n# We can solve for the maximum period deterministically by setting b2 to its\n# maximum allowed value, b2 = 1.\n# P2_max = P1 * (1 / b1)^(3/2)\nP2_max_exact = P1_days * (1.0 / b1)**(1.5)\n\n# (d) Printing the Final Verified Answer\nprint(\"Deterministic Verification step:\")\nprint(f\"The exact maximum period for Planet 2 is calculated to be {P2_max_exact:.4f} days.\")\n\n# The provided radii for the star and planets are not required for this specific\n# interpretation of \"exhibiting both transit and occultation events\" (b<=1).\n\n# Comparing the result with the given options.\noptions = {'A': 12.5, 'B': 7.5, 'C': 37.5, 'D': 33.5}\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - P2_max_exact))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value of {P2_max_exact:.2f} days is closest to option {closest_option} ({options[closest_option]}).\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer: {options[closest_option]}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
