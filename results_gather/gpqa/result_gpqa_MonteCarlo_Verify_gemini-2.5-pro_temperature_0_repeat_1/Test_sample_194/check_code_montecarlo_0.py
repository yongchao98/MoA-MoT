    # --- 2. State the physical model and constraints ---
    # The problem asks for the maximum period of a second planet (P2) that will
    # exhibit both transit and occultation events.
    # The LLM correctly assumes that this condition is met as long as the center of the
    # planet passes in front of the star's disk.
    # The limiting case for this is when the planet's center grazes the edge of the star,
    # which corresponds to a maximum impact parameter for Planet 2 (b2) of 1.

    # The relationship between impact parameters (b), semi-major axes (a), orbital periods (P)
    # for two planets in the same orbital plane (same inclination 'i') around the same star is:
    #
    # From the definition of impact parameter: b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s
    # -> b2 / b1 = a2 / a1
    #
    # From Kepler's Third Law: P^2 is proportional to a^3
    # -> (P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3  =>  a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)
    #
    # Combining these gives the relationship used by the LLM:
    # -> b2 / b1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)

    # --- 3. Calculate the maximum period for Planet 2 ---
    # We can solve for the maximum period (P2_max) by setting b2 to its maximum value (b2_max = 1).
    # P2_max = P1 * (b2_max / b1)^(3/2)
