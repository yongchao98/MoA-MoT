    "Answering this question involves predicting the 1H NMR spectra for four candidate molecules and then determining which 1:1 mixture would produce the observed spectrum.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. In a 1:1 molar mixture, this means each compound must contribute one aromatic singlet, and both singlets must represent the same number of protons.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. The total number of aliphatic signals from the two compounds must be three.\n\n2.  **Predict Spectra for Individual Compounds:**\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to high symmetry, it shows one aromatic singlet (2H) and one aliphatic singlet (12H).\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** Shows one aromatic singlet (2H) and three aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H, in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** Shows one aromatic singlet (2H) and two aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H, in a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Shows one aromatic singlet (4H), one quartet (4H, -CH2-), and one triplet (6H, -CH3-). It does not have only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n3.  **Monte Carlo Exploration & Deterministic Verification:**\n    The strategy is to form pairs of the candidate compounds and check if their combined 1:1 spectrum matches the target. We can immediately eliminate any pair containing 1,4-diethylbenzene because its aromatic signal (4H) would not produce a 1:1 ratio with the 2H signals of the other compounds, and it introduces non-singlet signals in the aliphatic region. This rules out option A.\n\n    We will now programmatically check the remaining combinations.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport math\n\ndef get_proton_ratio(integrals):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to simplify a list of integrals to their simplest integer ratio.\"\"\"\n    if not integrals:\n        return []\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(*integrals)\n    return sorted([i // common_divisor for i in integrals])\n\ndef solve_nmr_mixture():\n    \"\"\"\n    Proposes and verifies the correct pair of compounds based on NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # (a) Sample: Define the spectral data for each candidate compound\n    compounds = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"aromatic_singlets\": [2],  # [proton_count]\n            \"aliphatic_singlets\": [12] # [proton_count, ...]\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"aromatic_singlets\": [2],\n            \"aliphatic_singlets\": [6, 3, 3]\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"aromatic_singlets\": [2],\n            \"aliphatic_singlets\": [6, 6]\n        },\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\n            \"aromatic_singlets\": [4],\n            \"aliphatic_singlets\": [] # Has non-singlet signals (quartet, triplet)\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Target spectrum for a 1:1 mixture\n    target = {\n        \"aromatic_singlets_count\": 2,\n        \"aromatic_ratio\": [1, 1],\n        \"aliphatic_singlets_count\": 3,\n        \"aliphatic_ratio\": [1, 1, 2] # Sorted version of 2:1:1\n    }\n\n    # (b) Narrow Candidates: Generate all possible pairs of compounds\n    candidate_names = list(compounds.keys())\n    possible_pairs = list(itertools.combinations(candidate_names, 2))\n    \n    verified_pair = None\n\n    # (c) Run Exact Checks: Iterate through pairs and verify against the target spectrum\n    for pair in possible_pairs:\n        c1_name, c2_name = pair\n        c1_data, c2_data = compounds[c1_name], compounds[c2_name]\n\n        # --- Aromatic Check ---\n        # Total number of aromatic singlets\n        total_ar_singlets = len(c1_data[\"aromatic_singlets\"]) + len(c2_data[\"aromatic_singlets\"])\n        if total_ar_singlets != target[\"aromatic_singlets_count\"]:\n            continue\n\n        # Ratio of aromatic singlets (must be 1:1, so proton counts must be equal)\n        ar_protons = c1_data[\"aromatic_singlets\"] + c2_data[\"aromatic_singlets\"]\n        if ar_protons[0] != ar_protons[1]:\n            continue\n\n        # --- Aliphatic Check ---\n        # Total number of aliphatic singlets\n        aliphatic_protons = c1_data[\"aliphatic_singlets\"] + c2_data[\"aliphatic_singlets\"]\n        if len(aliphatic_protons) != target[\"aliphatic_singlets_count\"]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Ratio of aliphatic singlets\n        aliphatic_ratio = get_proton_ratio(aliphatic_protons)\n        if aliphatic_ratio == target[\"aliphatic_ratio\"]:\n            # This pair is a match\n            verified_pair = pair\n            break\n\n    # (d) Print Final Answer\n    print(\"--- Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Target Aromatic Signals: {target['aromatic_singlets_count']} singlets in a {target['aromatic_ratio']} ratio.\")\n    print(f\"Target Aliphatic Signals: {target['aliphatic_singlets_count']} singlets in a {target['aliphatic_ratio']} ratio.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Verification ---\")\n    if verified_pair:\n        print(f\"Found a matching pair: {verified_pair[0]} and {verified_pair[1]}\")\n        c1_data = compounds[verified_pair[0]]\n        c2_data = compounds[verified_pair[1]]\n        \n        print(f\"\\nChecking {verified_pair[0]}:\")\n        print(f\"  Aromatic: {len(c1_data['aromatic_singlets'])} singlet(s) for {c1_data['aromatic_singlets']}H\")\n        print(f\"  Aliphatic: {len(c1_data['aliphatic_singlets'])} singlet(s) for {c1_data['aliphatic_singlets']}H\")\n        \n        print(f\"\\nChecking {verified_pair[1]}:\")\n        print(f\"  Aromatic: {len(c2_data['aromatic_singlets'])} singlet(s) for {c2_data['aromatic_singlets']}H\")\n        print(f\"  Aliphatic: {len(c2_data['aliphatic_singlets'])} singlet(s) for {c2_data['aliphatic_singlets']}H\")\n\n        print(\"\\nCombined 1:1 Mixture Spectrum:\")\n        combined_ar_protons = c1_data['aromatic_singlets'] + c2_data['aromatic_singlets']\n        combined_al_protons = c1_data['aliphatic_singlets'] + c2_data['aliphatic_singlets']\n        print(f\"  Aromatic: {len(combined_ar_protons)} singlets ({combined_ar_protons[0]}H and {combined_ar_protons[1]}H).
