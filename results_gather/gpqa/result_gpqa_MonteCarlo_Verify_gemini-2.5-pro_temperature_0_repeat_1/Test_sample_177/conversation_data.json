    "Answering this question requires dimensional analysis within the framework of quantum field theory in 4-dimensional spacetime, using natural units where $\\hbar=c=1$.\n\nThe process involves:\n1.  Determining the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density, $\\mathcal{L}$.\n2.  Determining the mass dimensions of the fields $\\psi$ and $F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n3.  Using these to find the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$.\n4.
