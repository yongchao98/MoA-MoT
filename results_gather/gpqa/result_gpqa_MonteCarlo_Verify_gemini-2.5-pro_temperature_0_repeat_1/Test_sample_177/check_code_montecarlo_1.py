    """
    This function checks the correctness of the given answer to a quantum field theory question.

    The question is:
    Given the Lagrangian L_int = κ * ψ_bar * σ_μν * ψ * F^μν, what is the mass dimension of κ?
    Is the theory renormalizable?

    The provided answer is C, which corresponds to:
    C) The mass dimension [κ]_M = -1. The theory is not renormalizable.

    # --- Step 1: Define known mass dimensions in natural units (ħ=c=1) ---
    # In D=4 spacetime dimensions, the action S = ∫ d⁴x L must be dimensionless.

    # Therefore, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density L must be [L]_M = 4.

    # The mass dimension of the fermion field ψ is derived from its kinetic term,
    # L_fermion ~ ψ_bar * ∂ * ψ.

    # The term σ_μν = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν] is composed of dimensionless gamma matrices.
    # Therefore, its mass dimension is 0.

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ ---
    # The interaction term L_int must also have a mass dimension of 4.
    # [L_int] = [κ] + [ψ_bar] + [σ_μν] + [ψ] + [F^μν]
    # Since [ψ_bar] = [ψ], this becomes:
    # 4 = [κ] + 2*[ψ] + [σ_μν] + [F^μν]
    # Solving for [κ]:
    calculated_dim_kappa = dim_L - (2 * dim_psi) - dim_sigma_munu - dim_F_munu

    # --- Step 3: Determine renormalizability based on the dimension of κ ---
    # A theory is considered non-renormalizable by power-counting if any of its
    # coupling constants have a negative mass dimension.
