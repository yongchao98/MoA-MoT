    "Answering this question involves relating a planet's equilibrium temperature to its orbital period.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's albedo ($A$), and its orbital distance ($a$). The relationship is $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{(1-A)^{1/4}}{\\sqrt{a}}$. Since the albedo is the same for all three planets, this term cancels out when we take ratios, simplifying the relationship to $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$. This means the ratio of temperatures between two planets is inversely related to the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances: $\\frac{T_i}{T_j} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_j}{a_i}}$.\n\n2.  **Orbital Period and Orbital Distance:** Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (orbital distance, $a$): $P^2 \\propto a^3$. This gives the relationship $P \\propto a^{3/2}$. The ratio of periods is therefore $\\frac{P_i}{P_j} = \\left(\\frac{a_i}{a_j}\\right)^{3/2}$.\n\n3.  **Combining the Relationships:** We can use the temperature ratios to find the ratio of orbital distances, and then use that to find the ratio of orbital periods. The mass ratios are not needed for this calculation.\n\nThe following Python code implements the required Monte Carlo exploration and deterministic verification.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_exoplanet_period_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses Monte Carlo simulation and deterministic calculation to find the\n    orbital period ratio of Planet3 to Planet1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given approximate ratios\n    T1_T2_mean = 1.4\n    T2_T3_mean = 2.3\n    options = {'A': 10.4, 'B': 4.4, 'C': 33.4, 'D': 3.2}\n\n    # (a) Sample: Run a Monte Carlo simulation\n    num_samples = 10000\n    period_ratios = []\n    for _ in range(num_samples):\n        # Sample from a narrow distribution around the given means\n        t1_t2_sample = np.random.normal(T1_T2_mean, 0.01)\n        t2_t3_sample = np.random.normal(T2_T3_mean, 0.01)\n\n        # From T_i/T_j = sqrt(a_j/a_i) => a_j/a_i = (T_i/T_j)^2\n        a2_a1 = t1_t2_sample**2\n        a3_a2 = t2_t3_sample**2\n\n        # Combine ratios to get a3/a1\n        a3_a1 = a3_a2 * a2_a1\n\n        # From P_i/P_j = (a_i/a_j)^(3/2)\n        p3_p1 = a3_a1**1.5\n        period_ratios.append(p3_p1)\n\n    # (b) Narrow candidates: Analyze the simulation results\n    monte_carlo_result = np.mean(period_ratios)\n    \n    # Find the closest option to the simulation's average result\n    closest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - monte_carlo_result))\n    \n    print(f\"Monte Carlo simulation with {num_samples} samples suggests a period ratio of ~{monte_carlo_result:.2f}.\")\n    print(f\"This is closest to option {closest_option}: {options[closest_option]}.\\n\")\n\n    # (c) Run exact checks: Perform the deterministic calculation\n    print(\"Performing deterministic verification...\")\n    # T1/T3 = (T1/T2) * (T2/T3)\n    T1_T3 = T1_T2_mean * T2_T3_mean\n    \n    # a3/a1 = (T1/T3)^2\n    a3_a1_exact = T1_T3**2\n    \n    # P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2)\n    p3_p1_exact = a3_a1_exact**1.5\n\n    # (d) Print the final verified answer\n    print(f\"Deterministic calculation steps:\")\n    print(f\"  1.

    "The user has confirmed that the previous response was correct. The Monte Carlo simulation and the deterministic verification both point to the same answer.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1.  **Relate Temperature and Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is related to its orbital distance ($a$) by the formula $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$. Therefore, the ratio of temperatures for two planets (1 and 3) is $\\frac{T_1}{T_3} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_3}{a_1}}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Overall Temperature Ratio:** We are given the ratios for adjacent planets. We can find the ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3 by multiplying them:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_3} = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\times \\frac{T_2}{T_3} = 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Orbital Distance Ratio:** Using the relationship from step 1, we can find the ratio of the orbital distances:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_3}\\right)^2 = (3.22)^2 \\approx 10.3684$\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Period and Orbital Distance:** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance ($a$), or $P \\propto a^{3/2}$. The ratio of periods is therefore:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{a_3}{a_1}\\right)^{3/2}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Period Ratio:** Substitute the value from step 3 into the equation from step 4:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2} \\approx 33.39$\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4, which corresponds to option C. The mass ratios and albedo value were extraneous information not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
