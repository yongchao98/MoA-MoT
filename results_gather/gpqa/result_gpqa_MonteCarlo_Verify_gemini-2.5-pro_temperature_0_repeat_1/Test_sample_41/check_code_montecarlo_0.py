    # The relationship between equilibrium temperature (T) and orbital distance (a) is T ∝ 1/sqrt(a).
    # Therefore, T_i / T_j = sqrt(a_j / a_i).
    # The relationship between orbital period (P) and orbital distance (a) is P ∝ a^(3/2).
    # Therefore, P_i / P_j = (a_i / a_j)^(3/2).

    # We want to find P3 / P1.
    # P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)

    # First, find the temperature ratio T1 / T3.
    # T1 / T3 = (T1 / T2) * (T2 / T3)
    T1_T3_ratio = T1_T2_ratio * T2_T3_ratio
