    # --- 1. Define the given ratios from the question ---
    # The question states the ratio of temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is ~1.4.
    # Assuming Planet 1 is closer and hotter, T1/T2 = 1.4.
    T1_over_T2 = 1.4
    
    # The ratio of temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3 is ~2.3.
    # Assuming Planet 2 is closer and hotter than Planet 3, T2/T3 = 2.3.

    # The provided answer is C, which corresponds to a factor of approximately 33.4.

    # --- 2. Perform the calculation based on physics principles ---
    
    # Step A: Calculate the overall temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet3.
    # The ratio T1/T3 can be found by multiplying the given ratios: (T1/T2) * (T2/T3)
    T1_over_T3 = T1_over_T2 * T2_over_T3
    
    # Step B: Relate the temperature ratio to the orbital distance (a) ratio.
    # For a planet in thermal equilibrium, its temperature T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a),
    # assuming the star's properties and the planet's albedo are constant.
    # The problem states the albedo is equal for all planets, so this holds.
    # T1/T3 = sqrt(a3/a1)
    # Squaring both sides gives: a3/a1 = (T1/T3)^2
    a3_over_a1 = T1_over_T3 ** 2
    
    # Step C: Use Kepler's Third Law to relate the orbital distance ratio to the orbital period (P) ratio.
    # For planets orbiting the same star, P^2 is proportional to a^3.
    # This means P is proportional to a^(3/2).
    # Therefore, the ratio of the periods is P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2).
    P3_over_P1_calculated = a3_over_a1 ** (3/2)

    # --- 3. Check the correctness of the answer ---
    
    # The mass ratios and the specific albedo value (0.3) are extraneous information,
    # as correctly identified in the provided answer's logic. They are not needed for the calculation.

    # A small tolerance is used to account for rounding in the problem's approximate values.
