    # --- Define Chemical Principles and Outcomes for Each Step ---

    # Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-Limonene
    # Principle: Catalytic hydrogenation (Pd/C) selectively reduces the less substituted double bond.
    # Limonene's exocyclic C=C is disubstituted, while the endocyclic one is trisubstituted.
    # Outcome: The exocyclic C=C is reduced to an isopropyl group. The endocyclic C=C remains.
    # Product 1: (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene. The C4(R) stereocenter is unaffected.

    }

    # Step 2 & 3: Epoxidation and Opening
    # Principle (Epoxidation): m-CPBA attacks the double bond. The bulky isopropyl group ('top' face)
    # directs the reagent to the opposite ('bottom') face for the major product. A minor product
    # results from attack on the same ('top') face.
    # Principle (Opening): NaOMe (nucleophile) attacks the less substituted epoxide carbon (C2) via S_N2 (inversion).
    
    # We must trace both major and minor pathways as the question asks for any valid isomer.

    # Path A: Major Pathway
    # Epoxidation: 'bottom' face attack -> trans-epoxide (oxygen is 'bottom').
    # Opening: MeO- attacks C2 from the 'top' face (inversion). OH at C1 is 'bottom'.
    # Resulting Stereochemistry (as per chemical rules): (1R, 2R, 4R)

    # Epoxidation: 'top' face attack -> cis-epoxide (oxygen is 'top').

    # Resulting Stereochemistry (as per chemical rules): (1S, 2S, 4R)
    minor_path_product_stereochem = "1S, 2S, 4R"

    # Step 4: Esterification
