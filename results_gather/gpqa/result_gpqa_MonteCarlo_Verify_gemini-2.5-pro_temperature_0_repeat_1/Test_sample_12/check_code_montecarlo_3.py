    # --- Step-by-step chemical derivation ---

    # Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene
    # Reaction: (R)-Limonene + 1 eq. H2, Pd/C
    # Rationale: Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C selectively reduces the less substituted
    # double bond. Limonene has a trisubstituted endocyclic C=C and a disubstituted
    # exocyclic C=C (in the isopropenyl group). The exocyclic bond is reduced.
    # The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected.
    # Product 1: (R)-p-menth-1-ene. Stereochemistry: C4=(R).

    # Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1
    # Reaction: (R)-p-menth-1-ene + m-CPBA
    # Rationale: The bulky isopropyl group at C4(R) sterically hinders one face of the
    # cyclohexene ring (the 'top' or 'wedge' face). The m-CPBA reagent will therefore
    # attack from the less hindered 'bottom' or 'dash' face (trans-attack).
    # This creates an epoxide on the dash face and two new stereocenters at C1 and C2.
    # - C4 remains (R).
    # - C1: With the epoxide O on the dash, the methyl group is on the wedge. Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities (O > C6 > C2 > Me) and noting the lowest priority group (Me) is on a wedge, the configuration is (S).
    # - C2: With the epoxide O on the dash, the hydrogen is on the wedge. Assigning priorities (O > C1 > C3 > H) and noting the lowest priority group (H) is on a wedge, the configuration is (S).
    # Product 2 Stereochemistry: (1S, 2S, 4R).

    # Step 3: Nucleophilic Epoxide Opening
    # Reaction: Product 2 + NaOMe
    # Rationale: The methoxide ion (MeO-) is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the epoxide
    # via an S_N2 mechanism.
    # - Regioselectivity: The attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon. C1 is quaternary (bonded to Me, C2, C6) while C2 is tertiary (bonded to C1, C3, H). The attack is at C2.
    # - Stereoselectivity: The attack is anti-periplanar to the C-O bond being broken. Since the epoxide is on the dash face, the MeO- attacks from the wedge face. This causes an inversion of configuration at C2.
    # The stereochemistry of the resulting alcohol (Product 3) is:
    # - C4 remains (R).
    # - C1 is not involved in the reaction, so it remains (S).
    # - C2 is inverted from (S) to (R).
    # Product 3 Stereochemistry: (1S, 2R, 4R).

    # Step 4: Esterification
    # Reaction: Product 3 + Propanoic acid, DCC, DMAP
    # Rationale: This is a Steglich esterification, which converts the alcohol at C1 into
    # a propionate ester. This reaction proceeds with retention of configuration at the
    # chiral center bearing the alcohol (C1).
    # Product 4 Stereochemistry: (1S, 2R, 4R).
