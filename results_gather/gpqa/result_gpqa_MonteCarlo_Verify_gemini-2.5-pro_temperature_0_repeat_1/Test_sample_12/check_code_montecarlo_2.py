    # --- Chemical Pathway Simulation (Major Product) ---

    # Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene
    # (R)-Limonene has a stereocenter at C4, which is (R).
    # Hydrogenation with 1 eq. H2 over Pd/C reduces the more accessible
    # exocyclic double bond (isopropenyl -> isopropyl).
    # Product 1 is (R)-p-menth-1-ene, or (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.
    # The stereocenter C4(R) is preserved.

    # Step 2: Epoxidation of (R)-p-menth-1-ene
    # m-CPBA attacks the alkene. The bulky isopropyl group at C4(R) is on a dash
    # and directs the attack to the opposite, less hindered face (the wedge).
    # This is the major pathway, leading to an epoxide on the wedge.
    # Stereochemistry of the major epoxide (Product 2) is (1R, 2S, 4R).

    # Step 3: Epoxide Ring Opening with NaOMe
    # The methoxide nucleophile (MeO-) attacks the less substituted carbon (C2)
    # via an SN2 mechanism. This involves inversion of configuration (*anti*-attack).
    # Since the epoxide is on the wedge, the MeO- attacks from the dash side.
    # The C1-O bond remains on the wedge and becomes an -OH group.
    # Stereochemistry of the resulting alcohol (Product 3):
    # - C4 remains (R).
    # - C1 becomes (S).
    # - C2 becomes (R).
    # The major alcohol product has (1S, 2R, 4R) stereochemistry.

    # Step 4: Steglich Esterification
    # The alcohol at C1 is converted to a propionate ester.
    # This reaction proceeds with retention of configuration at all stereocenters.
    # The stereochemistry of the final product (Product 4) is (1S, 2R, 4R).
