    # --- Step-by-Step Chemical Analysis (Major Pathway) ---

    # Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene
    # (R)-Limonene has two double bonds. Catalytic hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H2
    # selectively reduces the less sterically hindered, exocyclic double bond.
    # The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected.
    product_1 = "(R)-1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohex-1-ene" # also known as (R)-p-menth-1-ene

    # Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1
    # The starting material has an (R) configuration at C4, meaning the bulky isopropyl
    # group acts as a stereodirecting group, effectively blocking the 'top' (wedge) face.
    # m-CPBA will therefore preferentially attack from the less hindered 'bottom' (dash) face.
    # This forms the major epoxide product, which is trans to the isopropyl group.
    major_epoxide = "Epoxide oxygen is on the dash face."

    # Step 3: Epoxide Opening with Sodium Methoxide
    # NaOMe is a strong nucleophile, and under basic conditions, it performs an SN2 attack
    # at the least substituted carbon of the epoxide (C2).
    # The attack is a 'backside' attack, anti-periplanar to the C-O bond being broken.
    # Since the epoxide C2-O bond is on the dash face, the MeO- nucleophile attacks from the wedge face.
    # The epoxide opens, leaving the original C1-O bond (now an alcohol) on the dash face.
    product_3_structure = {
        "C4_isopropyl": "wedge", # From (R)-Limonene
        "C1_OH": "dash",        # From epoxide opening
        "C2_OMe": "wedge"       # From nucleophilic attack
    }

    # Step 4: Stereochemical Assignment of Product 3
    # We assign the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities to determine the stereochemistry.
    # C4: (R) - This is given in the starting material.
    # C2: The substituents are OMe (wedge), H (dash), C1, C3. Priority: OMe > C1 > C3 > H.
    #     With the lowest priority group (H) on the dash, a clockwise path (OMe->C1->C3) gives (R).
    # C1: The substituents are OH (dash), Me (wedge), C2, C6. Priority: OH > C2 > C6 > Me.
    #     With the lowest priority group (Me) on the wedge, we trace the path OH->C2->C6, which is
    #     clockwise. Because the lowest priority group is on a wedge, we reverse the result. Clockwise -> R -> (S).
    product_3_stereochem = "(1S, 2R, 4R)"

    # Step 5: Esterification
    # The final step is a Steglich esterification, which converts the alcohol (OH) at C1
    # to a propionate ester. This reaction does not affect any of the stereocenters.
