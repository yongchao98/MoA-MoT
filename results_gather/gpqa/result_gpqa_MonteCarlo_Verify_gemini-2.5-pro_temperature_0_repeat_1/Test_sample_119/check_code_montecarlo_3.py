    # --- Symbolic Derivation ---

    # Step 1: The number of stars (N) up to a distance (d) is proportional to the volume of a sphere of that radius,
    # assuming a uniform star density (rho).
    # N(d) ∝ Volume ∝ d^3
    # We can write this as N(d) = C * d^3 for some constant C.
    N_of_d = C * d**3

    # Step 2: Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d).
    # For small angles, plx = 1/d (in appropriate units). Therefore, d = 1/plx.
    d_of_plx = 1 / plx

    # Step 3: Express the cumulative number of stars as a function of parallax.
    # N(plx) represents the total number of stars with parallax greater than or equal to plx
    # (i.e., within a distance d = 1/plx).
    N_of_plx = N_of_d.subs(d, d_of_plx)
    # This simplifies to N(plx) = C / plx^3

    # Step 4: The question asks for the "number of stars per unit range of parallax".
    # This is the number density in parallax space, which is the magnitude of the derivative of N with respect to plx, |dN/d(plx)|.
    # The magnitude is taken because the number of stars in a bin must be positive.
    # The negative sign from the raw derivative just indicates that the cumulative count N decreases as plx increases.
    num_density_plx = sympy.Abs(sympy.diff(N_of_plx, plx))
    # The derivative of C*plx^-3 is -3*C*plx^-4. The absolute value is 3*C*plx^-4.

    # Step 5: Analyze the derived relationship.
    # The result, 3*C/plx^4, shows that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4.

DERIVATION:
1.  The number of stars N up to a distance d is proportional to the volume: N ∝ d^3.
2.  Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance: plx ∝ 1/d, which means d ∝ 1/plx.
3.  Substituting (2) into (1), the cumulative number of stars with parallax ≥ plx is: N(plx) ∝ (1/plx)^3 = plx^-3.
4.  The number of stars per unit range of parallax is the magnitude of the derivative of N(plx):
    |dN/d(plx)| ∝ |d/d(plx) [plx^-3]| ∝ |-3 * plx^-4| ∝ plx^-4.
5.  Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4."""
