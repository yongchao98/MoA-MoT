    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the star parallax problem.
    The problem states stars are uniformly distributed, and asks for the relationship
    between the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/d(plx)) and parallax (plx).
    The proposed answer is D, which corresponds to dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx^4.

    This function performs a Monte Carlo simulation to verify this relationship.

        # To get a uniform volume density, the number of stars in a shell of radius r
        # should be proportional to the volume of the shell (4*pi*r^2*dr).
        # This means the probability density function for the distance r is p(r) ~ r^2.
