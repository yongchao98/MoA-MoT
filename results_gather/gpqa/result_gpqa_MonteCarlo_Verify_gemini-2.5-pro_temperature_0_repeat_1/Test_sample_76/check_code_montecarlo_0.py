    # --- Part 1: Verification of Reaction A ---
    # A rearrangement must produce an isomer. Let's check the molecular formulas.
    # Reactant A: benzyl prenyl ether -> C12H16O
    # SMILES: c1ccccc1COCC=C(C)C
    formula_reactant_A = "C12H16O"

    # Product from options C/D: 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol -> C12H16O
    # SMILES: CC(=CCC(O)c1ccccc1)C
    formula_product_A_CD = "C12H16O"

    # Product from options A/B: (Z)-2-methyl-5-phenylpent-2-en-1-ol -> C12H16O
    # SMILES: c1ccccc1CCC=C(C)CO
    formula_product_A_AB = "C12H16O"
    
    # Correction: A previous manual check was flawed. All potential products listed for A are isomers.
    # The check must rely on chemical plausibility.
    # The reaction is a Wittig rearrangement. The base deprotonates the benzylic carbon.
    # [Ph-CH(-)-O-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2]
    # The [1,2]-shift (migration of the prenyl group to the carbanion) yields:
    # Ph-CH(OH)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, which is 1-phenyl-4-methylpent-3-en-1-ol.
    # The name in the option, 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol, refers to this same structure.
    # This is a known, plausible pathway.
    # The other product, 2-methyl-5-phenylpent-2-en-1-ol, is not formed via standard Wittig pathways.
    # Therefore, the analysis points to the product in options C and D.
    
    # --- Part 2: Verification of Reaction B ---
    # The reaction is a thermal Cope rearrangement, which is an isomerization.
    # The reactant name contains "...hexahydro...".
    # The product must therefore also be a "...hexahydro..." compound to conserve the atom count.
    # A "...tetrahydro..." product would imply a loss of 2 hydrogen atoms (H2), which is an
    # oxidation reaction, not a simple thermal rearrangement.
    
    # This logic eliminates options A and D, which propose a "tetrahydro" product.
    
    # --- Conclusion ---
    # Analysis of Reaction A points to options C or D.
    # Analysis of Reaction B points to options B or C.
    # The only option that satisfies both constraints is C.
    # The LLM's answer and reasoning are correct.
