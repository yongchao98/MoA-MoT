    This function verifies the number of carbon atoms in the final product of a multi-step synthesis.

    1. trans-cinnamaldehyde + methylmagnesium bromide -> Product 1
    2. Product 1 + PCC -> Product 2
    3. Product 2 + Corey-Chaykovsky reagent -> Product 3
    The question asks for the number of carbon atoms in Product 3.

    # reagent adds to the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde.

    # PCC is a mild oxidizing agent that converts a secondary alcohol (like Product 1)
    # into a ketone.
    # This oxidation reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms.
    # Product 2 is 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one.

    # (like Product 2) via conjugate addition to form a cyclopropane ring across the C=C double bond.
    # The reaction effectively adds a methylene (CH2) group, which contains one carbon atom.
