def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the given answer to the physics problem.

    The problem asks for the minimum resolution 'd' needed to observe at least 30% of decays.
    This is interpreted as finding the distance 'd' such that the probability of a particle
    traveling further than 'd' before decaying is 0.30.

    The probability of a particle surviving to distance 'd' is P(L > d) = exp(-d / L_avg),
    where L_avg is the average decay length in the lab frame.

    The calculation steps are:
    1. Calculate the particle's momentum and Lorentz factor from its energy and mass.
    2. Calculate the average decay length (L_avg) in the lab frame.
    3. Calculate the required resolution 'd' using the decay probability.
    4. Compare the calculated 'd' with the provided answer.

    # 1. Calculate momentum in relativistic units (pc in GeV)
    # E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m0)^2
    pc_in_GeV = np.sqrt(E**2 - m0**2)

    # 2. Calculate the average decay length in the lab frame (L_avg)
    # L_avg = (pc / m0) * c * tau0
    L_avg = (pc_in_GeV / m0) * c * tau0

    # 3. Calculate the required resolution 'd'
    # The formula is d = -L_avg * ln(P_survival)
    
    # Calculation with P_survival = 0.30 (as stated in the question)
