def check_mfp_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer regarding the mean free paths λ1 and λ2.

    The core physics principle is the difference in the mean free path (MFP) formula
    for gas-gas collisions versus electron-gas collisions.

    1.  λ1 (MFP of gas-gas collisions):
        In a gas of identical molecules, the relative motion of all particles is considered.
        This introduces a factor of sqrt(2) into the standard MFP formula.
        λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ)
        where 'n' is the number density and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.

    2.  λ2 (MFP of electron-gas collisions):
        The high-energy electrons move much faster than the gas molecules, which can be
        treated as stationary targets. The electron is effectively a point particle.
        The MFP formula for a fast particle through stationary targets does not have the sqrt(2) factor.
        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ)

    3.  Relationship between λ1 and λ2:
        By taking the ratio of the two equations, we find:
        λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ)] = sqrt(2)
        So, the theoretical relationship is λ2 = sqrt(2) * λ1.
    """

    # The theoretical ratio of λ2 to λ1 is sqrt(2).
    theoretical_ratio = math.sqrt(2)  # Approximately 1.414

    # The question's answer 'A' corresponds to the condition: λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1
    # This is equivalent to checking if the ratio (λ2 / λ1) is >= 1.22.
    condition_ratio = 1.22

    # Check if the theoretical ratio satisfies the condition from answer 'A'.
    is_answer_A_correct = (theoretical_ratio >= condition_ratio)

    if is_answer_A_correct:
        # The derived physical relationship (λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1) is consistent with
        # the condition given in answer A (λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1).
        # Let's quickly verify that other options are incorrect.
        # B) λ2 < λ1  => ratio < 1. False, 1.414 is not < 1.
        # C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 => 1 < ratio < 1.22. False, 1.414 is not < 1.22.
        # D) λ2 = λ1 => ratio = 1. False.
        # Since only condition A is satisfied, the answer is correct.
        return "Correct"
    else:
        # This block would execute if the answer 'A' was incorrect.
        return (f"Incorrect. The provided answer 'A' states that λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. "
                f"However, based on the kinetic theory of gases, the relationship is λ2 = sqrt(2) * λ1, "
                f"which means λ2 ≈ {theoretical_ratio:.3f} * λ1. The condition from answer 'A' "
                f"({theoretical_ratio:.3f} >= {condition_ratio}) is actually true, so there might be a logic error. "
