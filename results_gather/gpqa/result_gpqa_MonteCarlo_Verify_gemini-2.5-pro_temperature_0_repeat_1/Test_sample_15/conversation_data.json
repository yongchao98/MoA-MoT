    "To determine the number of optically active compounds, we will first make a probabilistic guess for each compound based on its name, then perform a deterministic analysis of each structure to verify its chirality.\n\nA compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key indicators of chirality are the presence of stereocenters (like a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of internal symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion). Compounds with stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry are called meso compounds and are achiral (optically inactive). Names containing stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), or specific isomer notations strongly suggest a single, chiral stereoisomer is being described, which would be optically active unless it's a meso compound.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef analyze_optical_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are optically active.\n    The process follows the requested methodology:\n    (a) A randomized \"Monte Carlo\" initial guess.\n    (b) A list of candidates is implicitly formed.\n    (c) A deterministic verification of each compound's chirality.\n    (d) A final, verified answer is printed.\n    \"\"\"\n    compounds = {\n        \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\": {\n            \"prob_active\": 0.05,  # No stereodescriptors, planar alkene\n            \"is_active\": False,\n            \"reasoning\": \"Achiral.
