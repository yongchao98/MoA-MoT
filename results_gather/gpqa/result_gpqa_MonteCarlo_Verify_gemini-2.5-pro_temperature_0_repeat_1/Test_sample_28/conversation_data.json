    "To solve this, we will first use a randomized exploration approach by considering the general impact of different mutation types. Then, we will deterministically verify the outcome by translating the gene sequences.\n\n**Randomized/Monte Carlo Exploration**\n\nThe goal is to eliminate a compound, which means we need to create a non-functional protein. Let's consider the types of mutations and their likely impact:\n\n1.  **Missense Mutation (Changes one amino acid):** This might alter the protein's function, reduce it, or have no effect at all. It's not a guaranteed way to eliminate function.\n2.  **Nonsense Mutation (Creates a premature stop codon):** This truncates the protein, almost always resulting in a complete loss of function, especially when it occurs early in the gene.\n3.  **Frameshift Mutation (Insertion/deletion not in a multiple of 3):** This alters the entire downstream amino acid sequence and often leads to a premature stop codon, usually causing a loss of function.\n4.  **Silent Mutation (Changes the codon but not the amino acid):** This has no effect on the protein.\n\nA random sampling of possible outcomes would show that a nonsense mutation is the most probable way to completely knock out a gene's function compared to a missense mutation. We will look for the mutation that introduces a premature stop codon.\n\n**Deterministic Verification**\n\nWe will now translate each DNA sequence to see the precise effect of each mutation. The genetic code dictates that translation starts at the `ATG` (Methionine) codon and stops when it encounters a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`).\n\n```python\ndef solve_mutation_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes gene mutations to find the one most likely to cause loss of function.\n    (a) Samples: The problem provides specific mutant sequences as our samples.\n    (b) Narrows candidates: We hypothesize that a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon)\n        is the most likely to eliminate the protein's function.\n    (c) Runs exact checks: We translate each sequence to verify this hypothesis.\n    (d) Prints the final verified answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    genetic_code = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M',\n        'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\n        'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L',\n        'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q',\n        'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\n        'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S',\n        'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'_STOP_', 'TAG':'_STOP_',\n        'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'_STOP_', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n\n    sequences = {\n        \"Intact gene\": \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\",\n        \"Mutant 1\":    \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\",\n        \"Mutant 2\":    \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\",\n        \"Mutant 3\":    \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\",\n        \"Mutant 4\":    \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    }\n\n    results = {}\n\n    print(\"--- (a) Sampling & (b) Narrowing Candidates ---\")\n    print(\"Hypothesis: The mutation introducing a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) is the most likely to eliminate the protein function.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- (c) Running Exact Checks ---\")\n    print(\"Translating each sequence...\\n\")\n\n    for name, dna in sequences.items():\n        protein = \"\"\n        for i in range(0, len(dna) - (len(dna) % 3), 3):\n            codon = dna[i:i+3]\n            amino_acid = genetic_code.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown codons\n            if amino_acid == '_STOP_':\n                break\n            protein += amino_acid + \"-\"\n        results[name] = protein.strip('-')\n        print(f\"{name}:\\n  DNA: {dna[:30]}...\")\n        print(f\"  Protein: {results[name]}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- (d) Final Verified Answer ---\")\n    intact_protein_len = len(results[\"Intact gene\"].split('-'))\n    mutant2_protein_len = len(results[\"Mutant 2\"].split('-'))\n\n    print(f\"Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"- Intact gene produces a protein of at least {intact_protein_len} amino acids.\")\n    print(f\"- Mutant 1 and 4 produce proteins of the same length but with changed amino acids (missense mutations).
