    # Principle 1: A magnetic monopole is a source/sink for the magnetic field.
    # This directly contradicts Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0).
    # Therefore, the equation for the "divergence of the magnetic field" must change.
    divergence_b_changes = True

    # Principle 2: Symmetry. A moving electric charge (current) creates a circulating B-field.
    # By symmetry, a moving magnetic charge (magnetic current) must create a circulating E-field.
    # This modifies Faraday's Law of Induction (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t).
    # Therefore, the equation for the "circulation of the electric field" must change.
    circulation_e_changes = True

    # The other two equations are not necessarily affected.
    # Gauss's Law for Electricity deals with electric charges.
    # Ampere-Maxwell Law deals with electric currents.
    # The introduction of magnetic monopoles does not directly require them to change.
