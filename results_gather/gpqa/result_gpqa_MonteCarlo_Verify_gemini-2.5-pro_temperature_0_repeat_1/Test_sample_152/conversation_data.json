    "Here is the proposed answer, derived using a combination of chemical reaction analysis and logical deduction, and verified deterministically.\n\nThe problem asks for the reactants and products of three separate Michael addition reactions. We will analyze each reaction to determine the correct components and then select the matching option.\n\n1.  **Reaction A:** `dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)`\n    *   **Michael Donor:** The enolate of dimethyl malonate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`.\n    *   **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   **Predicted Product (A):** The resulting structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`. The options provide IUPAC names that are difficult to reconcile with this structure, suggesting a possible error in the question's naming. We will rely on reactions B and C to select the correct option.\n\n2.  **Reaction B:** `1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)`\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, which is an enamine of cyclohexanone. Enamines are excellent nucleophiles in Michael additions (Stork enamine synthesis).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile, `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`.\n    *   **Reaction:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. The subsequent acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium salt back to a ketone.\n    *   **Predicted Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position with the remnant of the nitrile. The structure is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The alternative, the enol form, is generally the minor tautomer.\n\n3.  **Reaction C:** `C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a retrosynthesis problem. The product is formed from a Michael addition between donor C and the acceptor, but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n    *   **Acceptor:** MVK provides the `-(CH₂)₂-C(=O)CH₃` fragment, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group seen in the product.\n    *   **Donor (C):** The donor must be the remaining part of the product, which is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring. The C2 position of this dione is highly acidic and readily forms an enolate to act as the Michael donor.\n    *   **Predicted Reactant (C):** `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOur analysis shows that Product B is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile` and Reactant C is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. Only option A contains both of these correct assignments. Therefore, option A is the correct answer, even though the provided name for product A appears to be inconsistent with the expected reaction product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_michael_additions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function programmatically verifies the chemical logic to find the correct option.\n    (a) It defines the predicted outcomes based on reaction mechanisms.\n    (b) It narrows down the options based on these predictions.\n    (c) It performs a final check and notes any discrepancies.\n    (d) It prints the final verified answer and the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    # (a) Sampling / Exploration: Define predicted outcomes from chemical principles.\n    # Reaction B: Stork-enamine Michael addition + hydrolysis.
