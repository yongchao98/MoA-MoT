    # Analysis of Option A: 1-vinylcyclohex-1-ene and methyl hex-2-ynoate
    # Type: Intermolecular Diels-Alder
    # Dienophile: Alkyne. Product has two double bonds in the new ring.
    # Skeleton: bicyclo[4.4.0]decadiene (a hexahydronaphthalene)
    if llm_answer == 'A':
        return "Incorrect. The reaction uses an alkyne as the dienophile. A Diels-Alder reaction with an alkyne produces a cyclohexadiene ring, resulting in a product with two double bonds (a hexahydronaphthalene). The target molecule is an octahydronaphthalene, which has only one double bond. This option fails the 'product_skeleton' constraint."

    # Analysis of Option C: Cyclohexene and methyl 2,3-dimethylenehexanoate
    # Type: Intermolecular Diels-Alder
    # Diene: CH3CH2CH2-C(=CH2)-C(=CH2)-COOCH3
    # New double bond in product is between original C2 and C3 of the diene.
    # The -COOCH3 group (via C1) is attached to C2, making it alpha to the new C=C.
    # The propyl group is attached to C4, which is attached to C3, also making it alpha.
    # This violates the constraint that the -COOCH3 group should NOT be alpha.
    if llm_answer == 'C':
        return "Incorrect. In the product from this intermolecular reaction, both the propyl group and the methyl carboxylate group would be alpha (adjacent) to the newly formed double bond. This fails the 'cooch3_alpha_to_double_bond' constraint, which requires the ester group *not* to be alpha to the double bond."

    # Type: Intramolecular Diels-Alder (IMDA)
    # Diene: C2=C3-C4=C5. Dienophile: C10=C11.
    # New double bond in product: C3=C4.
    # -COOCH3 group is on C1->C2. C2 is next to C3. So, -COOCH3 is alpha. (FAIL)
    # -Propyl group is on C11. C11 is not next to C3 or C4. So, propyl is not alpha. (FAIL)
    # The regiochemistry is the opposite of what is required.
    if llm_answer == 'D':
        return "Incorrect. This intramolecular reaction would place the new double bond between C3 and C4. As a result, the methyl carboxylate group would be alpha to the double bond, and the propyl group would not be. This is the exact opposite of the regiochemistry required by the target molecule."

    # Type: Intramolecular Diels-Alder (IMDA)
    # Dienophile: C2=C3. Diene: C8=C9-C10=C11.
    # New double bond in product: C9=C10.
    # -COOCH3 group is on C1->C2. C2 is not next to C9 or C10. So, -COOCH3 is NOT alpha. (PASS)
    # -Propyl group is on C11. C11 is next to C10. So, propyl IS alpha. (PASS)
