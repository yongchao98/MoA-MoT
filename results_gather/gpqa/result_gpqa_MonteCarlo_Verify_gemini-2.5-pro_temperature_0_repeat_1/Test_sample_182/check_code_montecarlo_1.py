    This function checks the correctness of the given answer for a chemistry question

    Question: What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when
              2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with
              red phosphorus and excess of HI?

    # 1. Analyze the reactant's structure to find its initial IHD.
    # The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated as:
    # IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)

    # 'cyclohex-': This indicates a six-membered ring.

    # 2. Analyze the effect of the reaction.
    # Reagent: Red phosphorus and excess of HI.
    # This is a powerful reducing agent that causes complete reduction.
    # - It reduces all pi bonds (both C=C and C=O) to single bonds.
    # - It preserves the carbon skeleton, including the ring structure.

    # 3. Determine the IHD of the final product.
    # The ring structure is preserved in the reaction.
