    # --- Step-by-step derivation from the Boltzmann Equation ---
    # 1. The problem states the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).
    #    This allows us to use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution
    #    of particles over various energy states. The ratio of the population of an excited state (N_j)
    #    to a lower state (N_i) is given by:
    #    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-delta_E / (k*T))
    #    where g_j and g_i are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.

    # 2. The problem states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited...
    #    when compared to the iron atoms in star_2". This means the ratio of the number of atoms
    #    in the excited state to the number of atoms in a reference lower state is twice as large for star_1.
    #    Let R(T) = N_j / N_i. The condition is R(T_1) = 2 * R(T_2).
    #    (g_j/g_i) * exp(-delta_E / (k*T_1)) = 2 * (g_j/g_i) * exp(-delta_E / (k*T_2))

    # 3. The statistical weight factor (g_j/g_i) is a property of the iron atom's energy levels
    #    and is the same for both stars, so it cancels out:
    #    exp(-delta_E / (k*T_1)) = 2 * exp(-delta_E / (k*T_2))

    # 4. To solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:
    #    ln[exp(-delta_E / (k*T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-delta_E / (k*T_2))]
    #    Using logarithm rules (ln(exp(x)) = x and ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)), we get:
    #    -delta_E / (k*T_1) = ln(2) - delta_E / (k*T_2)

    # 5. Rearranging the equation to solve for ln(2):
    #    delta_E / (k*T_2) - delta_E / (k*T_1) = ln(2)
    #    Factor out the common term (delta_E / k):
    #    (delta_E / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)
    #    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis by finding a common denominator (T_1*T_2):
    #    (delta_E / k) * ((T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)) = ln(2)
    #    This is the full, physically correct relationship.

    # --- Check the crucial approximation ---
    # The options A, B, C, D are simplified and do not contain delta_E or k. This strongly implies
    # that an approximation is intended based on the specific values provided in the question.
    # Let's calculate the value of the dimensionless prefactor (delta_E / k):
    prefactor = delta_E / k_boltzmann
    
    # The problem is cleverly constructed so that delta_E is numerically almost identical to k.
    # prefactor = (1.38e-23) / (1.380649e-23) ≈ 0.9995
    
    # We check if this prefactor is approximately 1.
