    "This problem can be solved using the method of images in electrostatics. The grounded conducting sphere can be replaced by an \"image charge\" that, together with the original charge, creates a zero potential surface where the sphere was.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is placed at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`.\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The potential energy `U` of a system of a point charge and a conductor can be calculated as `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all other charges (in this case, the induced surface charge on the sphere).\n\n    The potential at position `d` due to the image charge `q'` (which represents the sphere's induced charge) is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n    Substituting the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_induced = k * (-q * R/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-q * R/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Now, we calculate the total potential energy `U`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    This result matches option D.

    "The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to a distance `d` from the center of the sphere. This work is done against the force from the induced charges on the sphere. The method of images simplifies this problem by replacing the grounded sphere with an image charge `q'` at a position `b` inside the sphere, such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**:\n    *   The image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R / d)`.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**:\n    The potential energy of the system is *not* simply the interaction energy between `q` and `q'`. A common mistake is to calculate `U = k * q * q' / (d - b)`. The correct formula for the potential energy of a charge `q` in the presence of a grounded conductor is half the interaction energy of the charge with its image. This factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge on the conductor is not a fixed charge; it is created by the field of `q`, and energy is stored in the field itself.\n\n    Alternatively, we can calculate the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d`. The force on charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is due to the image charge `q' = -qR/x` at a position `b = R^2/x`.\n    The force is `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n\n    The work done (and thus the potential energy) is the integral of this force from infinity to `d`:\n    `U = -∫[∞ to d] F(x) dx` (The negative sign is because `U` is the work done *by* the field).\n    `U = ∫[∞ to d] -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\n    Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R / 2 * ∫[∞ to d^2-R^2] 1/u^2 du`\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R / 2 * [-1/u] |_[∞ to d^2-R^2]`\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R / 2 * [-1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞)]`\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R / 2 * [-1/(d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Let's re-check the work calculation. The work done *by the agent* against the field force is `W = ∫[∞ to d] -F(x) dx`.\n    `W = ∫[∞ to d] k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n    `W = k * q^2 * R / 2 * ∫[∞ to d^2-R^2] 1/u^2 du`\n    `W = k * q^2 * R / 2 * [-1/u] |_[∞ to d^2-R^2]`\n    `W = k * q^2 * R / 2 * [-1/(d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `W = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    This matches the result from the simpler method: `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    `V_induced` is the potential at `d` due to the image charge `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)] = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    This result corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef solve_potential_energy_final():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses randomized exploration and deterministic verification to find the potential energy\n    of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere.
