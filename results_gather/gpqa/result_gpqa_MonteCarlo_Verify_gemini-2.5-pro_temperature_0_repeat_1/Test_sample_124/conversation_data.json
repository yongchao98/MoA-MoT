    "Answering this question involves determining the energy levels and their degeneracies for a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$.\n\nThe Schrödinger equation for this potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates, meaning the total Hamiltonian is a sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians: $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\nFor the 3D isotropic case, the total energy is the sum of the energies in each dimension:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The energy levels are then given by $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $N$.\n\n1.  **Ground State:** $N=0$. The only combination is $(0,0,0)$. Energy is $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$. Degeneracy is 1.\n2.  **First Excited State:** $N=1$. Combinations are $(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)$. Energy is $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$. Degeneracy is 3.\n3.  **Second Excited State:** $N=2$. Combinations are $(2,0,0)$ (3 permutations) and $(1,1,0)$ (3 permutations). Total degeneracy is $3+3=6$. Energy is $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n4.  **Third Excited State:** $N=3$. This is the state we are interested in.\n\nWe will use a Monte Carlo simulation to propose a likely degeneracy for the $N=3$ state, and then verify it deterministically.\n\n```python\nimport random\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve_3d_qho():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses Monte Carlo exploration to propose and deterministic calculation to verify\n    the energy and degeneracy of the 3rd excited state of a 3D isotropic QHO.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The state is defined by quantum numbers (nx, ny, nz).\n    # The principal quantum number is N = nx + ny + nz.\n    # The energy is E = (N + 3/2) * hbar * omega.\n    # The states are: Ground (N=0), 1st excited (N=1), 2nd (N=2), 3rd (N=3).\n    # We are interested in the 3rd excited state, which corresponds to N=3.\n    target_N = 3\n\n    # (a) Randomized/Monte Carlo Sampling\n    # Sample random quantum number triplets to estimate the degeneracy for N=3.\n    num_samples = 50000\n    max_n_val = 10  # A reasonable upper bound for sampling\n    sampled_states_for_N3 = set()\n\n    for _ in range(num_samples):\n        nx = random.randint(0, max_n_val)\n        ny = random.randint(0, max_n_val)\n        nz = random.randint(0, max_n_val)\n        if nx + ny + nz == target_N:\n            sampled_states_for_N3.add((nx, ny, nz))\n\n    # (b) Narrowing Candidates from Sampling\n    # The energy for N=3 is E = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω.\n    # The Monte Carlo sampling gives an estimate for the degeneracy.\n    mc_degeneracy_estimate = len(sampled_states_for_N3)\n    \n    print(f\"Monte Carlo Exploration:\")\n    print(f\"Found {mc_degeneracy_estimate} unique states for N=3 in {num_samples} samples.\")\n    print(f\"This suggests a likely candidate: Energy = (9/2)ħω, Degeneracy = {mc_degeneracy_estimate}\\n\")\n\n    # (c) Deterministic Verification\n    # Calculate the exact energy and enumerate all states for N=3.\n    exact_degeneracy = 0\n    exact_states = []\n    # For nx+ny+nz=N, each n_i cannot be greater than N.\n    for nx in range(target_N + 1):\n        for ny in range(target_N + 1):\n            for nz in range(target_N + 1):\n                if nx + ny + nz == target_N:\n                    exact_degeneracy += 1\n                    exact_states.append((nx, ny, nz))\n\n    # The energy formula is E_N = (N + 3/2)ħω.\n    energy_coefficient_numerator = 2 * target_N + 3\n    energy_coefficient_denominator = 2\n    \n    # (d) Print Final Verified Answer\n    print(\"Deterministic Verification:\")\n    print(f\"The third excited state corresponds to N = {target_N}.\")\n    print(f\"Verified Energy: E = ({target_N} + 3/2)ħω = ({energy_coefficient_numerator}/{energy_coefficient_denominator})ħω\")\n    print(f\"Verified Degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions): {exact_degeneracy}\")\n    print(f\"The states are: {sorted(exact_states)}\")\n    \n    final_energy_str = f\"({energy_coefficient_numerator}/{energy_coefficient_denominator}) ħω\"\n    final_degeneracy = exact_degeneracy\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Final Answer ---\")\n    print(f\"The value of energy of the third excited state is {final_energy_str}, and there are {final_degeneracy} linearly independent eigenfunctions.\")\n    print(\"Comparing with the options:\")\n    print(f\"A) 11 π^2 ħ^2 / (2m r^2), 10\")\n    print(f\"B) (9/2) ħω, 10\")\n    print(f\"C) 11 π^2 ħ^2 / (2m r^2), 3\")\n    print(f\"D) (9/2) ħω, 3\")\n    \n    if final_energy_str == \"(9/2) ħω\" and final_degeneracy == 10:\n        print(\"\\nThe verified result matches option B.\")\n        final_answer = \"B\"\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nThe verified result does not match any of the options.\")\n        final_answer = \"None\"\n        \n    # The final output required by the platform.\n    # print(f\"\\n<<< {final_answer} >>>\")\n\nsolve_3d_qho()\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants to find the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state for a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$.\n\nThis is a standard problem in quantum mechanics.
