    This function verifies the energy and degeneracy for the third excited state
    of a 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.

    The function will:
    1. Identify the principal quantum number 'N' for the third excited state.
    2. Calculate the theoretical energy using the formula E_N = (N + 3/2) * hbar * omega.
    3. Calculate the theoretical degeneracy using the formula g_N = (N+2)(N+1)/2.
    4. Parse the energy and degeneracy from the selected answer (Option B).
    5. Compare the theoretical values with the answer's values.
