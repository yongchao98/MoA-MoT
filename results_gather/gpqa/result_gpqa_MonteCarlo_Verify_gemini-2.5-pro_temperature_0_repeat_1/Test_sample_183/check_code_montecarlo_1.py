    # Step i: Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene. (Correct)
    # Step ii: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky t-Bu group is an o,p-director,
    #          strongly favoring the para product for steric reasons.
    # Major Product of Step ii: 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.
    
    # Step iii: Reduction of 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene -> 4-tert-butylaniline.
    
    # Step iv: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. The -NH2 group becomes -NH3+ (meta-director)
    #          and the -tBu group is an o,p-director. Both direct to the same position.
    # Product of Step iv: 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.
