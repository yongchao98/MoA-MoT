    # Principle: Increased volume dilutes reactants, which generally slows down a reaction.
    # Conclusion: This is a plausible cause for a slowdown.

    # For an acid-catalyzed reaction, a 1000-fold decrease in catalyst concentration would cause a dramatic slowdown.
    # Conclusion: This is a very strong and plausible cause for the slowdown.

    # The effect of a 1000-fold decrease in the concentration of a likely catalyst (H+) is far more
    # significant and impactful than the general dilution effect from an unspecified volume increase.
