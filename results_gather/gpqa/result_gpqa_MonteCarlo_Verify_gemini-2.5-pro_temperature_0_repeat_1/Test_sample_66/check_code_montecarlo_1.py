    # The individual angular momentum quantum numbers are l1=1, l2=1 (p-orbitals).

    # --- Measurement in Question ---
    # We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of L1z and L2z as -ħ.
    # The eigenvalue of Lz is m_l * ħ.
    # Therefore, we are measuring for the outcome where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

    # The selection rule for the addition of angular momenta requires that
    # the sum of the z-component magnetic quantum numbers of the individual
    # particles must equal the total z-component magnetic quantum number of the system.
    # m_total = m1 + m2
    # If this rule is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for that combination is zero,
    # and thus the probability of measuring that outcome is zero.
