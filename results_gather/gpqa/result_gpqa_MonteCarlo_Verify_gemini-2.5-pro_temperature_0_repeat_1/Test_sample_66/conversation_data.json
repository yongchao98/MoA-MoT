    "Answering this question involves applying the principles of angular momentum addition in quantum mechanics.\n\n### 1. Monte Carlo / Randomized Exploration\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome for the z-components of angular momentum for two electrons. Let the individual magnetic quantum numbers be $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n\n*   **System State:** The two-electron system is in a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$. This means the total angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$ and the total magnetic quantum number is $m=-1$.\n*   **Individual States:** The electrons are in p-orbitals, so their individual orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$. This means the possible values for their magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1, m_2 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Sampling:** We can randomly sample pairs of possible outcomes $(m_1, m_2)$ from the set $\\{-1, 0, 1\\} \\times \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. There are $3 \\times 3 = 9$ possible distinct outcomes.\n*   **Narrowing Candidates:** A fundamental principle of angular momentum addition is the conservation of the z-component. The total magnetic quantum number must be the sum of the individual ones: $m = m_1 + m_2$. In our case, the system has $m=-1$. Therefore, any measurement outcome $(m_1, m_2)$ must satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$.\n    Let's filter the 9 possible outcomes:\n    *   (1, 1) -> sum=2 (invalid)\n    *   (1, 0) -> sum=1 (invalid)\n    *   (1, -1) -> sum=0 (invalid)\n    *   (0, 1) -> sum=1 (invalid)\n    *   (0, 0) -> sum=0 (invalid)\n    *   **(0, -1) -> sum=-1 (VALID)**\n    *   (-1, 1) -> sum=0 (invalid)\n    *   **(-1, 0) -> sum=-1 (VALID)**\n    *   (-1, -1) -> sum=-2 (invalid)\n*   **Proposed Answer:** The question asks for the probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. From our analysis, this outcome has a sum of $m_1+m_2 = -2$, which violates the conservation rule ($m=-1$). Therefore, this outcome is impossible, and its probability should be 0.\n\n### 2. Deterministic Verification\n\nThe probability of measuring the state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ when the system is in the state $|l, m\\rangle$ is given by the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $P(m_1, m_2) = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are non-zero only if $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n\n*   **Target Measurement:** We want to measure $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to have eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   **Check Condition:** We check if the conservation rule is satisfied: $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n*   **System State:** The system is in the state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$, so the total magnetic quantum number is $m=-1$.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$ (because $-2 \\neq -1$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is exactly zero. The probability, which is the square of this coefficient, is also zero.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this process.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\nimport random\n\ndef solve_angular_momentum_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses randomized/Monte Carlo exploration to propose a likely answer,\n    then deterministically verifies it.\n\n    Problem:\n    Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state.\n    The coupled angular momentum state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>.\n    What is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both L1z and L2z\n    as -hbar?
