    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the Feynman diagram loop question.
    
    The core principle is that in a four-dimensional quantum field theory, each loop
    in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^2 to the amplitude after
    dimensional regularization.
    
    The total loop factor is therefore (1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^(2L), where L is the
    number of loops.
    
    By inspecting the given expression, we can find the exponent of (4pi) and solve for L.
