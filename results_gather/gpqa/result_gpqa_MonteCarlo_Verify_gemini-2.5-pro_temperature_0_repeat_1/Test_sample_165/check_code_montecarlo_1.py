    # The mass-squared of a pseudo-Goldstone boson from one-loop radiative corrections
    # follows the Coleman-Weinberg potential. The key constraints are:
    # 1. Prefactor: The mass-squared is inversely proportional to the square of the symmetry-breaking scale,
    #    here represented by (x^2 + v^2). So, this term must be in the denominator.
    # 2. Signs of Terms: In the supertrace formula (Str[M^4]), contributions from bosons (spin 0, 1)
    #    are positive, while contributions from fermions (spin 1/2) are negative.
