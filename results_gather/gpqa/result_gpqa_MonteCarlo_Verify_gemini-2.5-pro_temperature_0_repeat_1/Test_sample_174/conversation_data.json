    "An oscillating spheroid charge distribution can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, especially when considering radiation in the far-field (radiation zone). The physics of electric dipole radiation provides a deterministic way to verify the correct answer. We will use a Monte Carlo-style exploration by treating the given options as a sample space and testing them against the established physical model.\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` for an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by:\n`dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴) / (32 π² c) * sin²(θ)`\nwhere `ω` is the angular frequency and `θ` is the angle with the z-axis. This function `dP/dΩ` is the `f(λ, θ)` mentioned in the problem.\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence**: The power is proportional to `sin²(θ)`. The maximum power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum, which is 1 (at `θ = 90°`). The power at `θ = 30°` will be proportional to `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`. Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `30°` is 1/4.\n\n2.  **Wavelength Dependence**: The power is proportional to `ω⁴`. The relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πc/λ`. Therefore, the power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴`, or `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nCombining these two facts, the fraction is 1/4 and the functional form includes a `λ⁻⁴` term. This points to option A. We will now verify this using the requested computational approach.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport random\n\ndef solve_radiation_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses a Monte Carlo-style exploration to select and verify the correct answer\n    for the oscillating spheroid radiation problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # (a) Sample: Define candidate functions based on the options provided.\n    # The options represent a sample space for the functional form of radiated power.\n    candidates = [\n        {'option': 'A', 'fraction_at_30': 1/4, 'lambda_power': -4},\n        {'option': 'B', 'fraction_at_30': 1/4, 'lambda_power': -3},\n        {'option': 'C', 'fraction_at_30': 1/2, 'lambda_power': -4},\n        {'option': 'D', 'fraction_at_30': 3/4, 'lambda_power': -6},\n    ]\n    \n    # The \"randomized exploration\" is simulated by shuffling the candidates.\n    random.shuffle(candidates)\n    print(\"--- (a) Sampling & (b) Narrowing Candidates ---\")\n    print(f\"Randomly ordered candidates for exploration: {[c['option'] for c in candidates]}\")\n\n    # (b) Narrow Candidates: Apply physical principles to find the expected form.\n    # An oscillating spheroid charge distribution acts as an oscillating electric dipole.\n    \n    # Principle 1: Angular Dependence of Electric Dipole Radiation\n    # The radiated power per unit solid angle, dP/dΩ, is proportional to sin²(θ).\n    # The maximum power 'A' is at θ=90°, where sin²(90°)=1.\n    # The fraction at θ=30° is sin²(30°) / sin²(90°).\n    theta_rad = np.deg2rad(30)\n    expected_fraction = np.sin(theta_rad)**2\n    print(f\"\\nPhysical Principle 1 (Angular): Expected fraction at 30° is sin²(30°) = {expected_fraction:.4f}\")\n\n    # Principle 2: Wavelength Dependence of Electric Dipole Radiation\n    # Radiated power is proportional to the square of acceleration, which goes as ω⁴.\n    # Since ω = 2πc/λ, power is proportional to (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴.\n    expected_lambda_power = -4\n    print(f\"Physical Principle 2 (Wavelength): Expected power dependence is λ^{expected_lambda_power}\")\n\n    # (c) Run Exact Checks: Verify each candidate against the physical model.\n    print(\"\\n--- (c) Running Exact Checks ---\")\n    passing_candidates = []\n    for candidate in candidates:\n        is_pass = True\n        # Check 1: Does the fraction match the sin²(θ) model?\n        if not np.isclose(candidate['fraction_at_30'], expected_fraction):\n            is_pass = False\n        \n        # Check 2: Does the wavelength dependence match the ω⁴ model?\n        if not candidate['lambda_power'] == expected_lambda_power:\n            is_pass = False\n        \n        if is_pass:\n            print(f\"Candidate {candidate['option']} PASSED verification.\")\n            passing_candidates.append(candidate)\n        else:\n            print(f\"Candidate {candidate['option']} FAILED verification.\")\n\n    # (d) Print the final verified answer\n    print(\"\\n--- (d) Final Verified Answer ---\")\n    if len(passing_candidates) == 1:\n        verified_answer = passing_candidates[0]['option']\n        print(f\"A single candidate, '{verified_answer}', is consistent with the physics of electric dipole radiation.\")\n        print(f\"The fraction is 1/4 and the wavelength dependence is λ⁻⁴.\")\n        print(f\"\\n<<< {verified_answer} >>>\")\n    elif len(passing_candidates) == 0:\n        print(\"No candidate passed the physical verification.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Multiple candidates passed, indicating an ambiguity in the problem statement or options.\")\n\nsolve_radiation_problem()\n```",
