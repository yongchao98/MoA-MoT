    # --- Calculation Steps ---

    # 1. Calculate the wave number k.
    # The electron's kinetic energy (50 MeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy (0.511 MeV),
    # so it is highly relativistic. However, using the relativistic formula for k does not lead to any of the options.
    # We proceed with the non-relativistic formula, which is likely what the question intended.
    # Non-relativistic formula: T = p^2 / (2*m_e) => p = sqrt(2*m_e*T)
    # k = p / hbar = sqrt(2*m_e*T) / hbar = sqrt(2 * (m_e*c^2) * T) / (hbar*c)
    k = np.sqrt(2 * m_e_c2 * T) / hbar_c
