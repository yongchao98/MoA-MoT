    # --- Step 1: Analyze Reaction A ---
    # Reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)
    # This is a Michael Addition.
    # The base (t-BuOK) creates a nucleophile by deprotonating an alpha-carbon of the ketone.
    # The ketone has two alpha-carbons: C2 and C6.
    # - C2 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with NO alpha-protons.
    # - C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one alpha-proton.
    # Therefore, the enolate must form at C6. This is the only possible site for deprotonation.
    # The C6-enolate then attacks the beta-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH2=CH-COOEt).
    # A new bond forms between C6 of the ketone and the beta-carbon of the acrylate.
    # The resulting adduct is a cyclohexanone with a -CH2-CH2-COOEt group at C6.

    # Naming Product A:
    # The principal functional group is the ester, so the parent name is "ethyl propanoate".
    # The cyclohexanone part is a substituent on the C3 of the propanoate chain.
    # To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number the ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6).
    # - Attachment point (original C6) is C1. It has a methyl group -> 1-methyl.
    # - The carbonyl group (original C1) is at C2 -> 2-oxo.
    # - The quaternary carbon (original C2) is at C3. It has an ethyl and a methyl group -> 3-ethyl, 3-methyl.
    # Combining these gives the substituent name: (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).
    # So, the full name for Product A is:
    correct_product_A = "ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate"

    # --- Step 2: Analyze Reaction B ---
    # Reaction: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH)
    # This is also a Michael Addition.
    # The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon alpha to the electron-withdrawing nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH3-CH2-CH2-NO2).
    # The resulting carbanion (CH3-CH2-CH(-)-NO2) is the nucleophile.
    # The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH3-CH=CH-CN).
    # The nucleophile attacks the beta-carbon of the acceptor (the CH group adjacent to the methyl group).
    # The resulting structure is: CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN

    # Naming Product B:
    # The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN).
    # The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons, so the parent name is "hexanenitrile".
    # Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.
    # - CN is C1.
    # - The methyl group is on C3 -> 3-methyl.
    # - The nitro group is on C4 -> 4-nitro.
    # So, the full name for Product B is:
    correct_product_B = "3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile"

    # --- Step 3: Verify the LLM's Answer ---
    # The provided answer is 'B'. Let's check the products listed in option B.
