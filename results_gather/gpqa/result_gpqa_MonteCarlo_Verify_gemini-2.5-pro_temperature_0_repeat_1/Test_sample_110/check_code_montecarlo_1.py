    # --- Verification for Reaction A ---
    # Reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)
    # Mechanism: Michael Addition
    # 1. Enolate Formation: The base (t-BuOK) deprotonates an alpha-carbon of the ketone.
    #    - The alpha-carbon at C2 is quaternary and has no protons.
    #    - The alpha-carbon at C6 is tertiary and has one proton.
    #    - Conclusion: Deprotonation MUST occur at C6.
    # 2. Nucleophilic Attack: The C6 enolate attacks the beta-carbon of ethyl acrylate.
    # 3. Product Naming: The options name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.
    #    - Parent Chain: ethyl propanoate.
    #    - Substituent (the ring) is on C3 of the propanoate.
    #    - Naming the ring substituent from its point of attachment (original C6):
    #      - New C1 (original C6) has a methyl group -> "1-methyl".
    #      - New C2 (original C1, the carbonyl) is an oxo group -> "2-oxo".
    #      - New C3 (original C2, the quaternary center) has an ethyl and a methyl -> "3-ethyl", "3-methyl".
    #    - Assembling the name: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.

    # --- Verification for Reaction B ---
    # Reaction: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH)
    # Mechanism: Michael Addition
    # 1. Carbanion Formation: KOH deprotonates the alpha-carbon of 1-nitropropane.
    # 2. Nucleophilic Attack: The resulting nitronate anion attacks the beta-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.
    # 3. Product Structure: CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN
    # 4. Product Naming: The nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group.
    #    - Longest chain including the nitrile carbon is 6 carbons -> hexanenitrile.
    #    - Numbering from CN as C1: CN(1)-CH2(2)-CH(CH3)(3)-CH(NO2)(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6).
    #    - Substituents: methyl at C3, nitro at C4.
    #    - Assembling the name: 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.
