    This function checks the number of stereoisomers for the compound
    6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol.

    It analyzes the structure to find all stereocenters (chiral carbons and
    double bonds capable of E/Z isomerism) and calculates the total number
    of stereoisomers using the 2^n formula. It then compares this calculated
    number to the provided answer.
