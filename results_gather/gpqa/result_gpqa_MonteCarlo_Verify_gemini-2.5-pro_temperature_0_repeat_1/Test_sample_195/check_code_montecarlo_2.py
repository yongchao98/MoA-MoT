    """
    This code block verifies the correctness of the answer for the 1D relativistic
    harmonic oscillator problem.

    The verification process is as follows:
    1.  **Derivation Check**: The correct formula for v_max is derived from the
        principle of conservation of relativistic energy. This derived formula is
        then compared to the formula in option C.
    2.  **Falsification of Other Options**: The other options (A, B, D) are tested
        against physical principles and a specific numerical test case to show
        why they are incorrect.
    """

    # Step 1: Confirm the derivation matches Option C.
    # As shown in the text explanation, the derivation from first principles yields:
    # v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + kA^2 / (2mc^2))^2)
    # This is an exact match for the formula given in Option C.
    # This provides strong evidence that C is the correct answer.

    # Step 2: Falsify the other options to ensure C is the *only* correct answer.
    # We can use a simple test case. Let's choose parameters such that the maximum
    # potential energy is equal to the rest mass energy, i.e., kA^2/2 = mc^2.
    # This simplifies the dimensionless term kA^2/(2mc^2) to 1.
    # Let epsilon = kA^2 / (2mc^2) = 1.0
    epsilon_test = 1.0
    c = 299792458.0  # Speed of light, for calculation

    # --- Test Option A ---
    # Formula: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1 / (1 - epsilon))
    # For epsilon = 1, this formula has a division by zero, making it singular.
    # For epsilon approaching 1, it predicts v_max > c. For example, at epsilon=0.99,
    # v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/0.01) = c * sqrt(101) > 10c.
    # This is unphysical. Thus, A is incorrect.
    try:
        v_A = c * np.sqrt(1 + 1 / (1 - epsilon_test))
        if not np.isnan(v_A):
             return "Constraint check failed: Option A should be undefined for epsilon=1.0 but was not."
    except (ZeroDivisionError, FloatingPointError):
        # This is the expected failure, so we pass.
        pass

    # --- Test Option B ---
    # Formula: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1 / (1 - kA^2/(2m))^2)
    # This formula is dimensionally inconsistent. The term kA^2/(2m) has units of
    # (Force/L)*L^2/M = (MLT^-2/L)*L^2/M = L^2 T^-2 = velocity^2.
    # A term with units of velocity^2 cannot be subtracted from the dimensionless number 1.
    # Thus, B is fundamentally incorrect.

    # --- Test Option D ---
    # Formula: v_max = sqrt(kA^2/m) (Classical result)
    # We can write this in terms of epsilon: kA^2/m = 2 * epsilon * c^2
    # So, v_max = sqrt(2 * epsilon * c^2) = c * sqrt(2 * epsilon)
    # For our test case epsilon = 1.0:
    v_D = c * np.sqrt(2 * epsilon_test)
    # v_D = c * sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414c.
    # This is an unphysical speed (v > c). Thus, D is incorrect for relativistic systems.
    if v_D <= c:
        return f"Constraint check failed: Option D was expected to predict v > c for epsilon=1.0, but it did not. Got v = {v_D/c:.4f}c."

    # --- Verify Option C ---
    # Formula: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + epsilon)^2)
    # For our test case epsilon = 1.0:
    v_C = c * np.sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + epsilon_test)**2)
    # v_C = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866c.
    # This result is physical (v < c) and consistent with the derivation.
    if v_C >= c:
        return f"Constraint check failed: Option C predicted an unphysical speed v >= c. Got v = {v_C/c:.4f}c."

    # Conclusion: The derivation matches C, and all other options are demonstrably false.
    return "Correct"
