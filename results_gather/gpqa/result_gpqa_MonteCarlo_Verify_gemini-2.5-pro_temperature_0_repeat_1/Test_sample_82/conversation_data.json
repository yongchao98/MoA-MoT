    "Answering this question requires a two-part calculation: first, determining the pH in a buffer region (25% titration), and second, determining the pH at the equivalence point where the weak acid has been fully converted to its conjugate base.\n\n1.  **Initial State & Dilution**: 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (HAc) is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   Initial moles of HAc = 0.020 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   The new volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L).\n    *   The new concentration of HAc is 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration**: At this point, 25% of the HAc has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (Ac⁻). The solution is a buffer.\n    *   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used: pH = pKa + log([Ac⁻]/[HAc]).\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵).\n    *   The ratio [Ac⁻]/[HAc] is 25/75 or 1/3.\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3).\n\n3.  **pH at Equivalence Point**: All 0.001 mol of HAc has reacted with NaOH to form 0.001 mol of sodium acetate (NaAc).\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH added = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L (10.00 cm³).\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ (0.050 L).\n    *   Concentration of acetate [Ac⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   The acetate ion hydrolyzes: Ac⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HAc + OH⁻.\n    *   We need Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n    *   Using an ICE table, Kb ≈ [OH⁻]² / [Ac⁻].\n    *   We can solve for [OH⁻], then find pOH, and finally pH = 14 - pOH.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations to verify the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport random\n\ndef solve_titration_ph():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function follows the user's requested methodology:\n    (a) Samples a candidate answer.\n    (b) Narrows candidates (in this case, by direct calculation).\n    (c) Runs exact checks for the two pH values.\n    (d) Prints the final verified answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values\n    Ka = 1.85e-5\n    Kw = 1.0e-14\n    \n    # Options provided in the question\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (4.26, 8.52),\n        \"B\": (3.17, 6.73),\n        \"C\": (4.57, 6.92),\n        \"D\": (4.73, 7.00)\n    }\n\n    # (a) Sample a candidate answer (for procedural compliance)\n    # In a deterministic problem, this step is trivial.
