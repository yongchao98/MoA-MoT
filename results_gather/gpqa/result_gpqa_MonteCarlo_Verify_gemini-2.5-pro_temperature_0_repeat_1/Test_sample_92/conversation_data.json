    "An analysis of the provided qPCR data reveals a fundamental contradiction with the principles of the technique.\n\nIn a correctly performed qPCR experiment, a higher initial concentration of the target nucleic acid results in the fluorescence signal crossing the threshold at an earlier cycle. This means a higher concentration corresponds to a *lower* Ct value. Conversely, a lower concentration requires more cycles to reach the threshold, resulting in a *higher* Ct value.\n\nThe provided data shows the exact opposite trend:\n-   **Highest Concentration** (100,000 copies/µl) has the **Highest Ct values** (~34.2).\n-   **Lowest Concentration** (10 copies/µl) has the **Lowest Ct values** (~21.0).\n\nThis inverted relationship indicates a critical error, most likely a mislabeling of the dilution series where the most concentrated sample was loaded in the well designated for the least concentrated, and so on. While other minor issues might exist (like replicate variability), this inversion is the most significant discrepancy, making the results unusable for creating a standard curve.\n\nThe code below deterministically verifies this analysis by checking each of the proposed options against the data.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_qpcr_data():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided qPCR data to identify the most likely discrepancy.\n    (a) Samples: The data is provided directly, so we use it as our sample.\n    (b) Narrows candidates: The candidates are the four multiple-choice options.\n    (c) Runs exact checks: Each option is evaluated against the data.\n    (d) Prints the final verified answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    data = {\n        100000: [33.9, 34.2, 34.5],\n        10000: [30.6, 30.9, 31.2],\n        1000: [27.3, 27.6, 27.9],\n        100: [24, 24.3, 24.6],\n        10: [20.7, 21, 21.3]\n    }\n\n    # --- (c) Run Exact Checks ---\n\n    # Check A: qPCR cannot be used for quantification.\n    # This is a known fact. qPCR is a primary method for quantification.\n    check_A_passed = False\n    reason_A = \"Factually incorrect. qPCR is a standard method for nucleic acid quantification.\"\n\n    # Check B: The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates.\n    deviations = {conc: max(cts) - min(cts) for conc, cts in data.items()}\n    check_B_passed = any(dev > 0.3 for dev in deviations.values())\n    reason_B = f\"Deviation check: {check_B_passed}.
