    # Option B: "The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates"

            break 
    # The deviation for every replicate set is 0.6, which is > 0.3. So, statement B is true.

    # Option C: "Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples"

    concentrations = sorted(list(data.keys())) # [10, 100, ..., 100000]

    is_C_true = all(mean_cts[i] < mean_cts[i+1] for i in range(len(mean_cts)-1))

    # Since no difference is strictly greater than 3.3, statement D is false.

    # --- Final Verdict ---
    # Both B and C are true statements describing issues with the data.
    # B describes a precision problem (replicates are too far apart).
    # C describes a fundamental accuracy problem (the entire trend is inverted), which suggests a catastrophic systematic error like mislabeling.
    # The inverted trend (C) is a far more significant discrepancy that invalidates the entire experiment's purpose (creating a standard curve) than the replicate precision (B).
    # Therefore, C is the best explanation for the discrepancies.
