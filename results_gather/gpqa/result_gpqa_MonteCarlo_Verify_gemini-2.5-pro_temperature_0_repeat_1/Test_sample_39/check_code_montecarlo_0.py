    # The correct answer is 'A'. Let's build the logic to verify this.
    # The key phrase is "on top of each other". This is a common colloquialism in organic chemistry labs.
    # We need to determine which physical property is most directly related to this observation.

    # Step 1: Identify the technique.
    # The phrase "on top of each other" most literally describes the visual outcome of a failed
    # chromatographic separation, especially Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC). On a TLC plate,
    # separated compounds appear as distinct spots. If they don't separate, the spots overlap,
    # appearing "on top of each other". This phrasing is less common for other techniques like distillation.

    # Step 2: Identify the principle of that technique.
    # Chromatography (TLC, column chromatography) separates compounds based on their differential polarity.

    # Step 3: Identify the cause of failure.
    # If compounds have very similar polarities, they interact with the stationary phase (e.g., silica gel)
    # and move with the mobile phase (solvent) at nearly identical rates, leading to poor or no separation.

    # Step 4: Evaluate the given answer against this logic.
    if llm_answer == 'A':
        # This aligns perfectly with our logic. Similar polarities cause failed chromatography,
        # which is described as compounds being "on top of each other".
        return "Correct"
    elif llm_answer == 'B':
        return "Incorrect. While similar boiling points cause failed distillations, the phrase 'on top of each other' is much more specific to the visual result of a failed chromatographic separation, which is based on polarity."
    elif llm_answer == 'C':
        return "Incorrect. Non-covalent interactions are the *mechanism* by which chromatography works, not the *problem*. The problem is that the compounds have similar polarities, which means the strength of their non-covalent interactions with the stationary phase is too similar to allow for separation."
    elif llm_answer == 'D':
        return "Incorrect. Optical rotation is a property used for characterization of chiral compounds, not for separation in this context. Two compounds can have very different polarities (and be easily separable) while having similar or identical optical rotations."
