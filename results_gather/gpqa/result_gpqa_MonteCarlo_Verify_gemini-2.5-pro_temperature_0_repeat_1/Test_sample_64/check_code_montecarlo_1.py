    # 1. Predict Product A
    # Reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+)
    # Analysis: The starting material is a 1,5-diene alcohol. The reagent KH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base
    # that deprotonates the alcohol to form an alkoxide. This setup is ideal for an Anionic Oxy-Cope
    # rearrangement, a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift that is greatly accelerated by the negative charge.
    # The rearrangement of the spiro[3.5]nonane system yields a bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane skeleton.
    # The acidic workup (H+) protonates the intermediate enolate, which tautomerizes to the most
    # thermodynamically stable ketone, the conjugated enone.
    predicted_product_A = "(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one"

    # 2. Predict Product B
    # Reaction: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA)
    # Analysis: The starting material is an allylic alcohol, reacting with an acylating agent (acetyl bromide)
    # in the presence of a strong, bulky lithium base (LDA). This is a classic setup for the
    # Ireland-Claisen rearrangement. The reaction proceeds via an ester intermediate, which is then
    # deprotonated by LDA to form a lithium enolate. This enolate undergoes a [3,3]-sigmatropic
    # rearrangement.
    # Crucially, the direct product of this rearrangement is a lithium carboxylate salt. Since no
    # acidic workup (like H+ or H3O+) is specified, the product remains as the salt.
