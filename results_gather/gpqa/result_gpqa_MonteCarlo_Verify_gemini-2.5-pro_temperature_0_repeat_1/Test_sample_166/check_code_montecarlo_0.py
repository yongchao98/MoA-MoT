def check_non_gaussianity_calculation():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the non-Gaussianity of a cat state.

    The function performs three calculations:
    1. The physically correct calculation based on the true moments of the cat state.
    2. The calculation based on the LLM's flawed assumption for the moments.
    3. A check of the simple value alpha^2, which the LLM suggests as an alternative.

    It then returns a detailed reason explaining why the LLM's reasoning is incorrect.
