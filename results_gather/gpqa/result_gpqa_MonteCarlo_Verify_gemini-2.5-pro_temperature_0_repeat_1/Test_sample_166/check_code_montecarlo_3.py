    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the non-Gaussianity
    of a specific SchrÃ¶dinger cat state.

    The process involves:
    1. Defining the state parameters as given in the problem.
    2. Recognizing that for a pure state, non-Gaussianity is the entropy of the
       reference Gaussian state, S(tau).
    3. Calculating the first and second moments of the given quantum state.
    4. Using these moments to define the covariance matrix of the reference Gaussian state.
    5. Calculating the symplectic eigenvalue (nu) from the covariance matrix.
    6. Calculating the von Neumann entropy S(tau) using nu.
    7. Comparing the final calculated value with the provided answer options.

    # 1. Define parameters from the problem statement.
    alpha = 0.5

    # The given state is a pure state, so its entropy S(rho) is 0.
    # The non-Gaussianity (nG) is defined as S(tau) - S(rho), which simplifies to nG = S(tau).
    # We need to calculate the entropy of the reference Gaussian state 'tau'.

    # 3. Calculate the second moments of the state rho.
    # For the odd cat state (|psi> ~ |alpha> - |-alpha>), the moments are:
    # <a^2> = alpha^2
    # <n> = <a_dag a> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)

    # 4. Determine the covariance matrix of the reference state tau.
    # The reference state tau is a zero-mean Gaussian state with the same second moments.
    # Its covariance matrix sigma for quadratures q = a+a_dag, p = i(a_dag-a) is determined by:
    # var_q = <q^2> = 2*Re(<a^2>) + 2<n> + 1

    var_p = -2 * np.real(moment_a_sq) + 2 * moment_n + 1

    # 5. Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue nu.
    # The determinant of the covariance matrix
    det_sigma = var_q * var_p
    # For a single mode, the symplectic eigenvalue nu = sqrt(det(sigma)).
    nu = np.sqrt(det_sigma)

    # 6. Calculate the von Neumann entropy S(tau).
    # S(tau) = ((nu+1)/2)*ln((nu+1)/2) - ((nu-1)/2)*ln((nu-1)/2)

    nG = s_tau
