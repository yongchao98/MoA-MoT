    Calculates the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a specific Schrödinger cat state.

    The method involves these steps:
    1.  The non-Gaussianity `del_b` is defined as `S(τ) - S(ρ)`. Since ρ is a pure state, its entropy S(ρ) is 0, so `del_b = S(τ)`.
    2.  `τ` is a reference Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as `ρ`.
    3.  For the given state (an odd cat state), the first moment `<a>` is 0, but the second moment `<a^2>` is non-zero. This means `τ` must be a squeezed thermal state.
    4.  We calculate the moments of `ρ`: `<a_dag a>` and `<a^2>`.
    5.  We solve for the parameters of the squeezed thermal state (`n_th` and `r`) by matching the moments.
    6.  This calculation reveals that the thermal photon number `n_th` of the reference state is exactly 1.
    7.  The entropy `S(τ)` is then calculated using the formula for a thermal state with `n_th = 1`.
