def check_cat_state_non_gaussianity():
    """
    Calculates the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schr√∂dinger cat state and verifies the given answer.

    The function follows these steps:
    1. Sets the parameters from the question: alpha = 0.5, phi = -pi/4.
    2. Calculates the second moments (<a^2> and <n>) for the specified cat state.
    3. Determines the covariance matrix (variances of q and p quadratures) for the
       reference Gaussian state 'tau' based on these moments.
    4. Computes the symplectic eigenvalue 'nu' from the determinant of the covariance matrix.
    5. Calculates the von Neumann entropy of the reference state, S(tau), which equals the nG.
    6. Compares the calculated nG with the value from option B (1.38).
