    # --- Energy Calculation ---
    # The total potential energy U is the sum of two parts:
    # 1. U_center_shell: Interaction between the central charge and the 12 shell charges.
    # 2. U_shell_shell: Interaction among the 12 shell charges themselves.

    # 1. Calculate U_center_shell
    # Each of the 12 shell charges is at a fixed distance r from the central charge.
    # U = k * q1 * q2 / r
    U_center_shell = N_shell * (k * q**2) / r

    # 2. Calculate U_shell_shell
    # To minimize energy, the 12 shell charges form a regular icosahedron.
    # We need the distances between the vertices of this icosahedron.
    # The golden ratio, phi, is essential for icosahedral geometry.
    phi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2

    # For an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius r, there are three
    # distinct distances between vertices:
    # d1: edge length (distance to 5 nearest neighbors)
    # d2: distance to 5 next-nearest neighbors
    # d3: distance to the 1 antipodal vertex (the sphere's diameter)
    d1 = 2 * r / math.sqrt(phi + 2)

    num_d2_pairs = 30  # Each of 12 vertices has 5 next-neighbors, /2
    num_d3_pairs = 6   # 12 vertices / 2 pairs

                     num_d3_pairs * (k * q**2 / d3))
