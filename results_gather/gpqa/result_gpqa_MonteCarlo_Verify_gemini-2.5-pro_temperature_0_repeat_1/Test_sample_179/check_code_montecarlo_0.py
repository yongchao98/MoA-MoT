    # --- Problem Setup ---

    K_E = 8.9875517923e9  # Coulomb's constant in N·m²/C²
    E_CHARGE = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge in C

    # System parameters

    # --- Theoretical Calculation ---
    # The total potential energy is the sum of two components:
    # 1. U_center_shell: Interaction between the central charge and the 12 shell charges.
    # 2. U_shell_shell: Interaction among the 12 shell charges.

    # To minimize total energy, the shell charges must arrange themselves to minimize
    # their mutual repulsion. This is the Thomson problem for N=12, and the known
    # solution is an icosahedral arrangement.

    # Pre-calculate the constant energy factor
    K_Q_SQUARED = K_E * Q**2

    # 1. Calculate U_center_shell
    # This is constant since the distance R is fixed for all 12 shell charges.
    # U = N * (k * q1 * q2 / r)
    energy_center_shell = N_SHELL * K_Q_SQUARED / R

    # 2. Calculate U_shell_shell for an icosahedron
    # We need the distances between the 12 vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R.
    # There are 12*11/2 = 66 pairs of vertices with three distinct separation distances.
    
    # Golden ratio
    phi = (1 + np.sqrt(5)) / 2
    
    # Edge length 's' of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R
    s = (4 * R) / np.sqrt(10 + 2 * np.sqrt(5))
    
    # The three distances and their counts are:
    # - dist_edge (s): 30 pairs (each vertex is connected to 5 others)
    # - dist_long_diagonal (s * phi): 30 pairs
    # - dist_diameter (2R): 6 pairs (each vertex has one antipodal vertex)
    
    energy_shell_shell = K_Q_SQUARED * (
        30 / s +
        30 / (s * phi) +
        6 / (2 * R)
    )

    # 3. Calculate total minimum energy
    calculated_energy = energy_center_shell + energy_shell_shell

    # --- Verification ---
    # Compare the calculated energy with the LLM's answer.
    # A small tolerance is used to account for potential differences in the precision
    # of fundamental constants used by the source of the question or rounding in the options.
    # A 1% relative tolerance is a reasonable threshold.
    relative_difference = abs(calculated_energy - llm_answer_value) / llm_answer_value
