    "*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This 100:32 (approximately 3:1) ratio for the M+ and M+2 peaks is a characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%)).\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight of the proposed formulas (all are isomers with formula C₇H₅ClO₂). Using ³⁵Cl, the mass is: (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 amu. This matches the M+ peak. The M+2 peak at 158 corresponds to the molecule containing the ³⁷Cl isotope. This data is consistent with a formula of C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic textbook signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this extreme broadness.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carbonyl group in an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. This eliminates options B (phenyl chloroformate) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), as neither contains a carboxylic acid group.\n\n*   **Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal appearing far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The signal is a singlet ('s') because this proton is not adjacent to any other protons to be split by. The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton. This reinforces the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The remaining signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). We have two signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n    *   This pattern of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic fingerprint for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution results in only two types of aromatic protons.\n    *   Let's consider the two remaining possibilities:\n        *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted (1,2) ring. Due to the lack of symmetry, it would have four distinct aromatic protons, leading to four separate and more complex signals in the NMR spectrum. This does not match the observed data.\n        *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted (1,4) ring. This substitution pattern has a plane of symmetry, leading to two sets of equivalent protons, which matches the NMR data. The two protons ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm). The two protons ortho to the chlorine atom are less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm. Each set of protons is split by its neighbor, resulting in two doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    All the provided spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) are fully consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
