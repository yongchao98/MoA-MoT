    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's deconstruct this name to understand its structure.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: This indicates a -COOH group. By IUPAC convention for cyclic carboxylic acids, the carbon atom to which the -COOH group is attached is C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: This means a formyl group (-CHO) is attached to C2 of the ring.\n*   **5-vinyl**: This means a vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5 of the ring.\n\nThe structure contains several features that contribute to its index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), which is also known as the degree of unsaturation. The IHD is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n\nLet's count these features in the reactant:\n*   **Number of rings**: 1 (the cyclohexane ring)\n*   **Number of π bonds**:\n    *   1 in the cyclohexene ring (C=C)\n    *   1 in the vinyl group (C=C)\n    *   1 in the carboxylic acid group (C=O)\n    *   1 in the formyl group (C=O)\n*   **Total π bonds**: 4\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the reactant is:\nIHD_reactant = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the reactant and calculate the IHD from it.\n*   Carbons (C): 6 (in the ring) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 2 (in -CH=CH2) = 10\n*   Hydrogens (H): Let's count them on the structure. C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H2), COOH(H), CHO(H), vinyl(H + H2) = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12.\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) = 3\n*   Molecular Formula of reactant: C10H12O3.\n\nThe formula for IHD is: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 (ignoring O and halogens).\nIHD_reactant = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\nThis confirms the IHD of the starting material is 5.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key functions are:\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to the corresponding alkane groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces alcohols (-OH) and ketones (C=O) to the corresponding alkane groups.\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds (C≡C) to single bonds (C-C), i.e., it saturates them.\n*   Importantly, it does not typically break stable carbocyclic rings like cyclohexane.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of Red P + HI on the reactant:\n*   The cyclohex-3-ene ring will be reduced to a saturated **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C bond becomes a C-C bond).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) at C2 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at C5 will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH2-CH3).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. The exact name would be 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane (or an isomer thereof, which doesn't affect the IHD). This product is a **saturated monocyclic alkane**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nWe can find the IHD of the product in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Based on structural changes**\n    The reaction with Red P + HI reduces all π bonds in the molecule but leaves the ring structure intact.\n    *   Number of rings in the product: 1\n    *   Number of π bonds in the product: 0 (all C=C and C=O bonds are reduced)\n    *   IHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n*   **Method 2: Based on the molecular formula of the product**\n    The carbon skeleton remains the same, so the product also has 10 carbon atoms. The product is a substituted cyclohexane. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (cycloalkane) is CnH2n.\n    *   Since C = 10, the formula of the product is C10H20.\n    *   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C - H/2 + 1\n    *   IHD_product = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1 for the final product. This value corresponds to the presence of the single ring in the otherwise completely saturated molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
