    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and Method\nWe have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere is an equipotential surface with its potential held at V=0.\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` will induce a distribution of charges on the surface of the conducting sphere. Calculating the potential energy by integrating over this complex charge distribution is difficult. A much simpler approach is the **method of images**.\n\nThe method of images states that the electric field and potential *outside* the sphere can be accurately described by removing the sphere and replacing it with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` located *inside* the sphere's original volume.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Location\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the system of induced charges on the sphere can be replaced by an image charge `q'` with the following properties:\n\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Location:** The image charge is located along the same line connecting the center to the charge `q`, at a distance `b` from the center, where `b = R^2 / d`.\n\nThis specific choice of `q'` and `b` ensures that the potential created by `q` and `q'` together is zero at all points on the surface where the sphere used to be (i.e., at a radial distance `R`), satisfying the \"grounded\" boundary condition.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position at `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. According to the method of images, this force is simply the Coulomb force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\nHowever, we must be careful. The induced charge (and thus the image charge) changes as `q` is brought in from infinity. A simpler and more direct way to calculate the energy is using the formula:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all other charges in the system (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). This potential `V_induced` is exactly the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.**\n*   The real charge `q` is at `d`.\n*   The image charge `q'` is at `b = R^2/d`.\n*   The distance between them is `Δx = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` due to `q'`.**\n`V_induced = k * q' / Δx`\nSubstitute the expressions for `q'` and `Δx`:\n`V_induced = k * (-q * R/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\nThe `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancels out:\n`V_induced = - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total potential energy `U`.**\nNow, use the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * (k * q^2 * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result matches option B. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive, and the system has lower potential energy than when the charge is at infinity.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect\nB) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct**\nC) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\n\n<<<B>>>"
