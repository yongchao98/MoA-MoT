    "To determine if a compound will exhibit optical activity, we need to check if the molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry (Ïƒ) and a center of inversion (i). Molecules containing at least one stereocenter are often chiral, but meso compounds are a key exception.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   Structure: `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule is an alkene. All atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers.\n    *   Conclusion: It is **achiral** and thus optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` indicate the presence of chiral centers. The molecule is specified as a single stereoisomer.\n    *   A molecule with multiple chiral centers can be achiral if it's a meso compound, which requires a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The parent structure, `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione`, is a derivative of norbornane and does possess a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.\n    *   However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` corresponds to a `C=CHCl` group at the bridge position (C8). This substituent is not symmetric (H on one side, Cl on the other). Its presence destroys the plane of symmetry that existed in the parent molecule.\n    *   Since the molecule has chiral centers and lacks any internal symmetry element that would make it meso, it is chiral.\n    *   Conclusion: As a specific enantiomer is named, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The configuration is given as `(2R,3S)`. This is a classic example of a meso compound.\n    *   In a meso compound, the molecule has chiral centers, but it is achiral overall because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry. The `(R,S)` configuration in this symmetric molecule results in a plane of symmetry halfway between C2 and C3.\n    *   Conclusion: It is a **meso compound (achiral)** and optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The configuration is `(2R,3R)`.\n    *   This molecule does not have an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   Conclusion: It is **chiral**, and as a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH group at C1.\n    *   The carbon C1 is attached to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) -CH2-CH=CH- part of the ring, and (4) -CH2-CH2- part of the ring. These four groups are different.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: It is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with three OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   There are two possible stereoisomers for 1,3,5-trisubstitution: one where all three OH groups are cis to each other (can exist in an all-equatorial conformation) and one where two are cis and one is trans (two equatorial, one axial in the most stable chair form).\n    *   The all-cis isomer has a C3 axis and three planes of symmetry. It is achiral.\n    *   The cis,trans isomer also possesses a plane of symmetry (passing through the trans-substituent and the carbon opposite to it). It is also achiral.\n    *   Since all possible stereoisomers of this compound are achiral, it cannot be optically active. The given notation `(1s,3s,5s)` must refer to one of these achiral forms.\n    *   Conclusion: It is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The name describes a ketone. The carbonyl group is at C1 of a butane chain. A cyclopentyl group is also attached to C1.\n    *   Structure: `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`. The side chain is `3-methylbutyl`, correctly numbered from the carbonyl C as C1.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential chiral center is C3 of the butane chain.\n    *   The groups attached to C3 are: (1) -H, (2) -CH3 (C4 of the chain), (3) another -CH3 (the substituent), and (4) the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group.\n    *   Since C3 is attached to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no other source of chirality.\n    *   Conclusion: It is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are the ones that are chiral.\n-   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n-   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n-   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n-   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n-   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n-   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n-   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
