    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Generation of the reactive diene and Diels-Alder reaction.**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (let's call it NBD-OtBu). This molecule is a dienophile with two reactive double bonds.\n*   **Reactant 2 Precursor:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. This molecule has a cyclohexa-1,3-diene core with two -CHBr2 groups on the adjacent sp3-hybridized carbons C5 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium iodide (NaI). This reagent is known to react with such tetrabromides to induce elimination, forming a highly reactive, conjugated system. The reaction is analogous to the formation of isobenzofulvene from α,α,α',α'-tetrabromo-o-xylene.\n*   **In situ generated diene (RD):** The reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with NaI generates 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. Let's call this molecule **RD**.\n\n    Structure of **RD**: It consists of a six-membered ring with double bonds at C1=C2 and C3=C4, and two exocyclic double bonds at C5=CH₂ and C6=CH₂. This molecule is a cross-conjugated triene and acts as a \"double diene\" in Diels-Alder reactions. Specifically, it has two equivalent diene systems: C2=C1-C6=CH₂ and C3=C4-C5=CH₂.\n*   **Diels-Alder Reaction:** The problem states that 1 equivalent of NBD-OtBu is combined with 2 equivalents of the diene precursor. This implies that the two double bonds of NBD-OtBu each react with one molecule of the generated diene **RD**. This is a double Diels-Alder reaction.\n    NBD-OtBu + 2 **RD** → Product **1**\n    Product **1** is a large, symmetric molecule with a central bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core. The exact stereochemistry is complex but is not needed for the final answer.\n\n**Step 2: Deprotection of the alcohol.**\n\n*   Product **1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard condition for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) at the C7 position of the norbornane core is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    Product **1** (-OtBu) → Product **2** (-OH)\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation of the alcohol.**\n\n*   Product **2** is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method to oxidize alcohols. The secondary alcohol at C7 is oxidized to a ketone.\n    Product **2** (-OH) → Product **3** (=O)\n    Product **3** is the double Diels-Alder adduct built upon a 7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal decomposition.**\n\n*   Product **3** is heated to 150°C. High temperatures can reverse Diels-Alder reactions. This is a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. The reaction is the reverse of Step 1.\n    Product **3** → 7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene + 2 **RD**\n*   The 7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene formed is known to be thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination (a type of retro-Diels-Alder reaction) to extrude carbon monoxide (CO) and form the highly stable aromatic molecule, benzene (C₆H₆).\n    7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene → Benzene + CO\n\n**Identifying Product 4**\n\nThe final reaction mixture contains Benzene, CO, and two molecules of the regenerated diene, **RD**. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens in the final product **4**.\n\n*   If **4** were benzene, it has 6 equivalent hydrogen atoms, so there would be only **1** type of chemically distinct hydrogen. However, '1' is not among the options (A) 7, B) 8, C) 4, D) 10).\n*   This strongly suggests that \"product 4\" refers to the other major organic product formed, which is the regenerated diene carrier, **RD** (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene). This is a common pattern in multi-step synthesis problems where a reagent is regenerated.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (RD)**\n\nWe need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (**RD**).\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has the formula C₈H₈. It has four hydrogens on the ring (one each on C1, C2, C3, C4) and four hydrogens on the two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry. This axis passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 single bond and the C5-C6 single bond.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** This C₂ symmetry element results in the following equivalences:\n    1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (Set 1: 2 hydrogens)\n    2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (Set 2: 2 hydrogens)\n    3.  The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) on C5 is equivalent to the one on C6.\n    4.  Within a single methylene group (e.g., at C5), the two hydrogens are not equivalent. Their environments are different with respect to the rest of the ring. They are diastereotopic. Let's call them H_inner (pointing towards the C2=C3 bond) and H_outer (pointing away).\n    5.  The C₂ symmetry maps the H_inner on C5 to the H_inner on C6. Thus, these two 'inner' hydrogens are chemically equivalent. (Set 3: 2 hydrogens)\n    6.  The C₂ symmetry maps the H_outer on C5 to the H_outer on C6. Thus, these two 'outer' hydrogens are chemically equivalent. (Set 4: 2 hydrogens)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn total, there are four sets of chemically equivalent hydrogen atoms in molecule **RD**. Therefore, there are **4** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms. This would give rise to 4 signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum. This matches option C.\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4 is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
