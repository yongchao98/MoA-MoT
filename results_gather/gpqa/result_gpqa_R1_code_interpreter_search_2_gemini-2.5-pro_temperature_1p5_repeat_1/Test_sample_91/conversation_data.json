    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the chemical formula provided: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nWe need to determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds.\n\n*   **Counting Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   `(CH3)2C=`: 1 central C + 2 C from methyl groups = 3 C\n    *   `=CH-`: 1 C\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 C\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 main chain C + 1 C from the methyl group = 2 C\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 C\n    *   `-CH=`: 1 C\n    *   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 central C + 2 C from methyl groups = 3 C\n    *   **Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 Carbon atoms.**\n\n*   **Counting Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   `(CH3)2`: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   `=CH-`: 1 H\n    *   `-CH2-`: 2 H\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 H + 3 H = 4 H\n    *   `-CH2-`: 2 H\n    *   `-CH=`: 1 H\n    *   `=C(CH3)2`: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   **Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogen atoms.**\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**. This corresponds to the general formula for an acyclic diene (CnH2n-2, where n=12, 2n-2 = 22), which validates our atom count.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Bonds**\n\nNow, we count the specific types of covalent bonds within the molecule.\n\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The formula clearly shows two double bonds: `C=C` and `C=C`.\n    *   Number of C=C bonds = **2**\n\n*   **C-H single bonds:** We already counted the hydrogen atoms. Since each is bonded to a carbon, there are **22** C-H bonds.\n\n*   **C-C single bonds:** Let's count the connections between carbon atoms that are not double bonds.\n    *   In `(CH3)2C=`: Two CH3 groups are attached to the first carbon of the double bond. (2 C-C bonds)\n    *   `=CH-CH2-`: One bond between the second and third carbons of the chain. (1 C-C bond)\n    *   `-CH2-CH(CH3)-`: One bond between the third and fourth carbons. (1 C-C bond)\n    *   In `-CH(CH3)-`: One methyl group is attached to the fourth carbon. (1 C-C bond)\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-CH2-`: One bond between the fourth and fifth carbons. (1 C-C bond)\n    *   `-CH2-CH=`: One bond between the fifth and sixth carbons. (1 C-C bond)\n    *   In `=C(CH3)2`: Two CH3 groups are attached to the seventh carbon. (2 C-C bonds)\n    *   **Total C-C single bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9 C-C bonds.**\n\nSummary of bonds:\n*   C-C: 9\n*   C=C: 2\n*   C-H: 22\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation can be calculated using Hess's Law with the following equation:\nΔH_f = (Sum of enthalpies of atomization of reactants) - (Sum of bond energies of the product)\n\n**Step 3a: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of reactants.**\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to turn the reactants into gaseous atoms: 12 C(g) + 22 H(g).\n*   Atomization of 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Atomization of 11 moles of Hydrogen (H2): 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**Step 3b: Calculate the sum of bond energies of the product.**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product C12H22(g) to form gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Sum of bond energies of the product = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**Step 3c: Calculate the final enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol.**\nΔH_f (kJ/mol) = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Sum of bond energies of product)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Convert Units to Match the Options**\n\nThe options provided are in kJ/g or kJ/mol. Our result is 1900 kJ/mol. This does not match options B, C, or D directly. Option A is in kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g.\n\n*   **Calculate the molar mass of C12H22:**\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 * Atomic Mass of C) + (22 * Atomic Mass of H)\n    *   Molar Mass ≈ (12 * 12 g/mol) + (22 * 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Convert kJ/mol to kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value is approximately 11.44 kJ/g, which matches option A.\n\nLet's verify the calculation using Python.\n```python\n# Given values\ndH_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nBE_H_H = 100      # kJ/mol\nBE_C_C = 200      # kJ/mol\nBE_C_eq_C = 300   # kJ/mol\nBE_C_H = 400      # kJ/mol\n\n# Atom and bond counts for C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H2 = 11\nnum_C_C = 9\nnum_C_eq_C = 2\nnum_C_H = 22\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of reactants (12 C(s) + 11 H2(g))\ndH_atom_reactants = (num_C * dH_atom_C) + (num_H2 * BE_H_H)\n\n# Sum of bond energies of product (C12H22)\nsum_BE_product = (num_C_C * BE_C_C) + (num_C_eq_C * BE_C_eq_C) + (num_C_H * BE_C_H)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\ndH_f_mol = dH_atom_reactants - sum_BE_product\n\n# Molar mass of C12H22\nmolar_mass = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g\ndH_f_g = dH_f_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(dH_f_g)\n```\n11.44578313253012\n\nThe calculated value is ~11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<A>>>",
