    "An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution, with oscillations along its symmetry axis (the z-axis), can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. This is because the oscillation creates a time-varying separation of positive and negative charge centers along the z-axis, which is the definition of an electric dipole moment. We assume the size of the spheroid is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation, which is a standard condition for the dipole approximation to hold.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities in the radiation zone (far-field):\n1.  The fraction of the maximum radiated power per unit solid angle that is radiated at an angle $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ with respect to the z-axis.\n2.  A possible functional form for the dependence of the radiated power per unit solid angle, $f$, on the wavelength $\\lambda$.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle ($dP/d\\Omega$) is given by the formula:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = f(\\lambda, \\theta) = K \\frac{\\sin^2(\\theta)}{\\lambda^4} $$\nwhere $K$ is a constant that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment and fundamental physical constants, and $\\theta$ is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n\nThe radiated power is proportional to $\\sin^2(\\theta)$. The maximum power, $A$, is radiated when $\\sin^2(\\theta)$ is maximum. The maximum value of $\\sin(\\theta)$ is 1, which occurs at $\\theta = 90^\\circ$ (or $\\pi/2$ radians), i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the axis of oscillation.\nSo, the maximum power per unit solid angle is:\n$$ A = \\left(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\right)_{\\text{max}} = K \\frac{\\sin^2(90^\\circ)}{\\lambda^4} = \\frac{K}{\\lambda^4} $$\n\nNow, we need to find the power radiated at an angle $\\theta = 30^\\circ$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\right)_{\\theta=30^\\circ} = K \\frac{\\sin^2(30^\\circ)}{\\lambda^4} $$\nThe fraction of the maximum power $A$ is the ratio of the power at $30^\\circ$ to the maximum power:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{(dP/d\\Omega)_{\\theta=30^\\circ}}{A} = \\frac{K \\sin^2(30^\\circ) / \\lambda^4}{K / \\lambda^4} = \\sin^2(30^\\circ) $$\nWe know that $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 1/2$. Therefore:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} $$\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Angle in degrees\ntheta_deg = 30\n\n# Convert angle to radians for the numpy sin function\ntheta_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\n\n# The radiated power is proportional to sin^2(theta).\n# The maximum power occurs when theta = 90 degrees, where sin^2(90) = 1.\n# The fraction of the maximum power is therefore sin^2(theta) evaluated at theta = 30 degrees.\nfraction = np.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\n# print the fraction\nprint(f\"The value of sin^2(30 degrees) is: {fraction}\")\n```\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe theory of electromagnetic radiation from an accelerating charge (the Larmor formula) shows that the radiated power is proportional to the square of the acceleration. For an oscillating charge, the position is $z(t) \\propto \\cos(\\omega t)$, so the acceleration is $a(t) = d^2z/dt^2 \\propto -\\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t)$. The time-averaged power is therefore proportional to $\\omega^4$.\n\nThe angular frequency $\\omega$ is related to the wavelength $\\lambda$ by $\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2\\pi c / \\lambda$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\nThus, the radiated power per unit solid angle, $f$, has a dependence on $\\lambda$ as follows:\n$$ f \\propto \\omega^4 \\propto \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right)^4 = \\lambda^{-4} $$\nThis $\\lambda^{-4}$ dependence is characteristic of electric dipole radiation and is famously responsible for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining our two findings:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ is 1/4.\n*   The functional form of the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to $\\lambda^{-4}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 1/4, $\\lambda^{-4}$\nB) 3/4, $\\lambda^{-6}$\nC) 1/4, $\\lambda^{-3}$\nD) 1/2, $\\lambda^{-4}$\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution, with oscillations along its symmetry axis (the z-axis), can be approximated as an oscillating electric dipole, especially if its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation.\n\n**Part 1: Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle ($dP/d\\Omega$) from an oscillating electric dipole along the z-axis is given by the Larmor formula for electric dipole radiation:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = C \\frac{\\sin^2(\\theta)}{\\lambda^4} $$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the observation direction and the dipole axis (z-axis), $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $C$ is a constant that depends on the amplitude of the oscillation, the charge, and fundamental constants.\n\nThe function describing the radiated power is $f(\\lambda, \\theta) = C \\frac{\\sin^2(\\theta)}{\\lambda^4}$.\n\nThe maximum radiated power, $A$, occurs when the $\\sin^2(\\theta)$ term is at its maximum. The maximum value of $\\sin(\\theta)$ is 1, which happens at $\\theta = 90^\\circ$ (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\nSo, the maximum power per unit solid angle is:\n$$ A = \\left(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\right)_{\\text{max}} = C \\frac{\\sin^2(90^\\circ)}{\\lambda^4} = \\frac{C}{\\lambda^4} $$\n\nWe want to find the fraction of this maximum power that is radiated at an angle $\\theta = 30^\\circ$. First, we calculate the power at this angle:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\right)_{\\theta=30^\\circ} = C \\frac{\\sin^2(30^\\circ)}{\\lambda^4} $$\n\nNow, we find the ratio of the power at $30^\\circ$ to the maximum power $A$:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{(dP/d\\Omega)_{\\theta=30^\\circ}}{A} = \\frac{C \\sin^2(30^\\circ) / \\lambda^4}{C / \\lambda^4} = \\sin^2(30^\\circ) $$\nThe value of $\\sin(30^\\circ)$ is $1/2$. Therefore, the fraction is:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nThe Python code execution confirmed this calculation, yielding approximately 0.25.\n\n**Part 2: Wavelength Dependence**\n\nThe formula for the radiated power per unit solid angle, $f(\\lambda, \\theta)$, is:\n$$ f(\\lambda, \\theta) = C \\frac{\\sin^2(\\theta)}{\\lambda^4} $$\nThis shows that the power is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. Thus, a possible form for the dependence on $\\lambda$ is $\\lambda^{-4}$. This dependence is characteristic of Rayleigh scattering and electric dipole radiation in general.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two results:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function $f$ is **$\\lambda^{-4}$**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
