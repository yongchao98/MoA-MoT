    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.**\n    *   Let S be the reference frame of the Galaxy (considered stationary).\n    *   Let S' be the reference frame of the supernova ejecta (considered moving).\n\n2.  **Identify the given quantities.**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval measured in the ejecta's frame is `Δt' = 50 s`. Since this time is measured by a clock at rest within the moving frame (S'), this is the **proper time** (often denoted as `τ` or `t₀`).\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal.**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` that the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n4.  **Apply the principles of Special Relativity.**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame (S) is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (S).\n    *   The time `Δt` in the stationary frame (S) is related to the proper time `Δt'` in the moving frame (S') by the **time dilation** formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor `γ` is defined as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Combine the formulas.**\n    *   Substitute the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula:\n        `d = v * (γ * Δt')`\n    *   This can be rearranged as:\n        `d = γ * (v * Δt')`\n\n6.  **Calculate the necessary components.**\n    *   First, calculate the non-relativistic distance (the distance that would be traveled if we ignored relativity, which is `v * Δt'`):\n        `d_classical = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n    *   Next, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`. We need the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the final distance `d`.**\n    *   `d = γ * 3,000,000 km = (1 / √(0.96)) * 3,000,000 km`\n    *   To get a numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple Python script.\n\nLet's perform the final calculation using a python script for precision.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s\n# Use the common approximation for c in such problems\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate the term (v*Δt')\nd_classical = v * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta_sq = (v/c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_sq)\n\n# Calculate the final distance d\nd = gamma * d_classical\n\nprint(f\"{d:.0f}\")\n```\n>>>\n3061862\n>>>\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. This value is very close to option D. The minor difference is likely due to the options being rounded.\n\n*   A) 2,940,000 km (This would be the result of misapplying the formula as `d = (1/γ) * (v * Δt')`, related to a misunderstanding of length contraction).\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km (This is the non-relativistic answer, `d = v * Δt'`).\n*   D) 3,060,000 km (This is the only answer greater than the non-relativistic distance, consistent with the effects of time dilation).\n\nBased on the calculation, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem requires us to calculate a distance in one reference frame (the Galaxy's) based on a time interval measured in another, moving reference frame (the ejecta's). This is a classic application of the principles of Special Relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The **Galaxy's frame (S)** is our stationary frame of reference. We want to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n    *   The **ejecta's frame (S')** is the moving frame of reference. The time is measured in this frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Knowns:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt' = 50 s`. Since this is the time measured by a clock at rest in its own frame, it is the **proper time**.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as observed from the Galaxy's frame. The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Time Dilation Formula:**\n    *   According to the theory of Special Relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for events occurring in a moving frame (the ejecta) than an observer in the moving frame measures (`Δt'`). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate gamma:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - β²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    *   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 102.06 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   Now use the calculated time `Δt` to find the distance `d`:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * 102.06 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n    *   Alternatively, we can combine the steps:\n        `d = v * (γ * Δt') = γ * (v * Δt')`\n        `d = (1 / √(0.96)) * (60,000 km/s * 50 s)`\n        `d = (1 / √(0.96)) * 3,000,000 km`\n        `d ≈ 1.0206 * 3,000,000 km ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is `3,061,862 km`.\n    *   The options are:\n        A) 2,940,000 km\n        B) 2,880,000 km\n        C) 3,000,000 km (This is the non-relativistic answer, ignoring time dilation)\n        D) 3,060,000 km\n    *   The calculated value `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option D, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is due to rounding in the options.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
