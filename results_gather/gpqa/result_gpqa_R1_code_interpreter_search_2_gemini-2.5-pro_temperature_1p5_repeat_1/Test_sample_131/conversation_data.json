    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided by the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds have the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. The fact that all signals are singlets indicates there is no proton-proton coupling between adjacent non-equivalent carbons (no H-C-C-H splitting). This is typical for protons on methyl groups next to a substituted benzene ring or other protons that lack neighbors on adjacent atoms.\n\n**2. Analyze the Structure and Expected 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds to see which pair could create the described mixture spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. This will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but different from the C1/C4 pair. This will produce **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry. A rigorous analysis shows it should have a single plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5, which would make the two aromatic protons (H4 and H6) equivalent. However, often due to steric crowding, these protons are observed as non-equivalent. For the purposes of this problem, let's look at what is most likely based on combining it with other molecules. The methyl groups are in three different environments (C1/C3 equivalent, C2 unique, C5 unique), leading to **three aliphatic singlets** with a ratio of **6H:3H:3H**. If the aromatic protons are non-equivalent, it would produce two 1H singlets. If they are equivalent, it would produce one 2H singlet.\n    *   **Summary:** Potentially 1 or 2 aromatic singlets, and 3 aliphatic singlets (6H:3H:3H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Ethyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The -CH2- protons will appear as a **quartet** and the -CH3 protons will appear as a **triplet**.\n    *   **Summary:** The presence of a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region immediately rules this compound out, as the problem specifies that all aliphatic signals are singlets.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture for Each Option**\n\nNow let's consider a 1:1 molar mixture of the pairs given in the options.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   This mixture would have a complex aromatic region (at least 2 signals, potentially 3) and at least 4 aliphatic signals before considering overlap. It's unlikely to simplify to the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet.\n        *   Assuming they have different chemical shifts, a 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. The integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets.\n        *   Assuming all three signals have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene has a quartet and triplet, but the spectrum only has singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   This combination would produce at least 2 (and possibly 3) aromatic signals with a ratio that is not 1:1. For example, if we combine a 2H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-TMB) with two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB), we would get three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio, which does not match the observed spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only one that perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture.\n\n<<<B>>>"
