    "This problem requires a multi-step calculation to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-).\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System**\nThe solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O). When dissolved in water, they dissociate into their respective ions:\n*   `KH2PO4 -> K+ + H2PO4-`\n*   `Na2HPO4●2H2O -> 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O`\n\nThe key species are H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate) and HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate). These form a conjugate acid-base pair, creating a buffer solution. The relevant equilibria for phosphoric acid (H3PO4) are:\n*   (1) `H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4-` (pKa1)\n*   (2) `H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-` (pKa2)\n*   (3) `HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-` (pKa3)\n\nOur buffer is based on equilibrium (2). We want to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-), which is the product of equilibrium (3).\n\n**2. Calculate Initial Concentrations**\nFirst, we need to calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components, H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.\n\n*   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n*   **For KH2PO4 (source of H2PO4-):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n    *   Concentration [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **For Na2HPO4●2H2O (source of HPO4^2-):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n    *   Concentration [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]**\nThe pH of the buffer is primarily controlled by the ratio of the conjugate acid (H2PO4-) to the conjugate base (HPO4^2-) and the pKa2 value. We can find the [H+] concentration using the expression for Ka2:\n\n*   `Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]`\n*   Rearranging for [H+]: `[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])`\n*   Given Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8\n*   `[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) = 8.106 x 10^-8 M`\n\n**4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-]**\nThe concentration of orthophosphate (PO4^3-) is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium, described by Ka3.\n\n*   `Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]`\n*   Rearranging for [PO4^3-]: `[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])`\n*   We use the given Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12, the calculated [H+], and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-] (since its dissociation is negligible).\n*   `[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.106 x 10^-8 M)`\n*   `[PO4^3-] = 6.237 x 10^-7 M`\n\nThis entire calculation can be efficiently performed using a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # Convert cm3 to L\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nMw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nMw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles and initial concentrations of buffer components\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / Mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\n\nmoles_HPO4_2_minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / Mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4_2_minus = moles_HPO4_2_minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2_minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-] concentration using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\northophosphate_conc = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2_minus / H_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation matching the options\nprint(f\"The concentration of orthophosphate ions is: {orthophosphate_conc:.2e} M\")\n```\n> The concentration of orthophosphate ions is: 6.24e-07 M\n\nThe calculated concentration is 6.24 x 10^-7 M, which matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understanding the System:**\n\n*   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n*   When dissolved, these salts provide H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions, respectively.\n*   These two ions form a conjugate acid-base pair (H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻), which constitutes a buffer solution. The pH of this buffer is determined by the ratio of these two species and the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka2.\n*   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ (HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻), which is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka3.\n\n**2.

The relevant equilibrium is: `H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻`, for which `Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]`.\n3.  **Calculate [PO₄³⁻]:** Using the [H⁺] from Step 2, the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻], and the value of Ka3, we can calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions, [PO₄³⁻]. The relevant equilibrium is: `HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻`, for which `Ka3 = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]`.\n\n**3.
