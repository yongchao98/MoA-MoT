    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning used to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The peak is very broad due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids and appear at higher wavenumbers (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with a broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group. The C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically found around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. Their presence definitively confirms the existence of a C=C double bond in the molecule.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment. We can calculate the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Carbon (C): ~12 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Hydrogen (H): ~1 amu\n        *   Total Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The observation of this fragment is extremely strong evidence that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined data (FTIR, MS), we know the compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This functional group has **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen.\n    *   We are left with **B (C6H10O2)** and **C (C6H12O2)**.\n    *   From the FTIR and ¹H NMR data, we know the compound also contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   Now, let's use the concept of **Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE)** to distinguish between the remaining options. The formula for DBE is:\n        DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)\n        Where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Each degree of unsaturation corresponds to one double bond or one ring.\n    *   Our molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond.\n    *   **Let's calculate the DBE for option C (C6H12O2):**\n        DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n        A DBE of 1 only accounts for one double bond (the C=O of the acid). This formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the evidence of a C=C bond.\n    *   **Let's calculate the DBE for option B (C6H10O2):**\n        DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n        A DBE of 2 perfectly matches our findings: one degree for the C=O double bond and a second degree for the C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the molecular formula C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
