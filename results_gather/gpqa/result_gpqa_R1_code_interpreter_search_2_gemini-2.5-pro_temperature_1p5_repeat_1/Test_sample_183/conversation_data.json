    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** This name indicates a benzene ring with three substituents. Let's assign the positions based on IUPAC nomenclature:\n    *   Position 1: ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are arranged in a 1,2,3-pattern on the benzene ring. This is a sterically crowded arrangement, which often requires a carefully planned synthesis, possibly involving blocking groups or manipulation of directing effects.\n*   **Relative Positions:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strong activator, ortho/para director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weak activator, ortho/para director. It is very bulky and sterically hinders its ortho positions.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strong deactivator, meta director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strong activator, ortho/para director. (Likely precursor to -OEt).\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strong activator, ortho/para director. (Likely precursor to -OH via diazotization).\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strong deactivator, meta director. Often used as a removable blocking group.\n\n**3. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies**\n\nA key challenge is the meta-relationship between the -OEt (an o,p-director) and the -NO2 group. This is difficult to achieve directly. It suggests that during the nitration step, the group at position 1 was not an -OEt group but rather a meta-director, or that the substitution pattern was orchestrated in a more complex way.\n\nLet's work backward from the final product.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis (reaction of a phenoxide with an ethyl halide). This is a common and efficient way to make ethers.\n    *   *Precursor:* 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol\n    *   *Reaction:* NaOH/EtBr\n\n*   **Step before last:** The phenol group (-OH) is likely formed from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n    *   *Precursor:* 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline (or 1-amino-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene)\n    *   *Reaction:* NaNO2/HCl, then H3O+/Heat\n\n*   **The Key Intermediate:** The core of the problem is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. This molecule has the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern. Let's analyze its synthesis. If we try to nitrate 2-tert-butylaniline, the strong activating amino group directs para (to position 5), and the ortho position (position 3) is severely hindered by the adjacent bulky tert-butyl group. This would not be a high-yield reaction for the desired isomer.\n\nThis suggests that a more complex route is needed, possibly one that does not involve the direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. Let's consider an alternative major pathway.\n\n**Alternative Pathway via Phenol**\n\nLet's see if we can build the structure starting from phenol.\n\n1.  **Synthesize Phenol from Benzene:** This can be done via nitration, reduction to aniline, and then diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n    *   Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Phenol\n    *   *Reagents*: i) HNO3/H2SO4, ii) Fe/HCl, iii) NaNO2/HCl then H3O+/Heat.\n\n2.  **Introduce the tert-butyl group:** Alkylate the phenol. Phenol is a strong activator, directing ortho and para. With a bulky electrophile like the tert-butyl cation, ortho substitution is significant.\n    *   Phenol → 2-tert-butylphenol (along with the 4-tert-butylphenol isomer, which would need to be separated).\n    *   *Reagent*: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3.\n\n3.  **Introduce the nitro group:** Nitrate 2-tert-butylphenol. Now we have two ortho/para directing groups, -OH (at C1) and -tBu (at C2).\n    *   The -OH group directs to positions 4 and 6.\n    *   The -tBu group also directs to positions 4 and 6.\n    *   Nitration will yield a mixture of 2-tert-butyl-4-nitrophenol and **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n    *   The desired precursor for our final product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**, which has the 1,2,3-arrangement (OH at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C6). This isomer can be separated from the 4-nitro isomer (e.g., via steam distillation, due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the ortho-nitrophenol).\n\n4.  **Introduce the ethoxy group:** Convert the phenol to an ether.\n    *   2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene (after renumbering for IUPAC name).\n    *   *Reagent*: NaOH/EtBr.\n\n**4. Match the Pathway with the Options**\n\nNow we match this successful pathway with the given options. The options seem to have scrambled numbering and potentially extraneous or duplicated reagents. We should look for the option that provides the necessary \"ingredients\" and starts in the correct direction.\n\n*   Our proposed pathway begins with making aniline and then phenol.\n    *   **Step 1:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene (HNO3/H2SO4)\n    *   **Step 2:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline (Fe/HCl)\n\n*   Let's examine the options:\n    *   A, B, and D start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3).\n    *   **C** starts with i) HNO3/H2SO4 and is followed by ii) Fe/HCl.\n\n*   Option **C** starts with the first two steps of our proposed viable synthesis. Let's see if the other reagents needed are present in option C.\n    *   **Our path:** Benzene → Aniline → Phenol → 2-tBu-phenol → 2-tBu-6-nitro-phenol → Final Product\n    *   **Reagents needed:** HNO3/H2SO4, Fe/HCl, NaNO2/HCl, H3O+/Heat, t-BuCl/AlCl3, NaOH/EtBr.\n    *   **Reagents in C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4, ii) Fe/HCl, iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3, iv) HNO3/H2SO4 (second nitration), v) NaNO2/HCl, vi) SO3/H2SO4, vii) dilute H2SO4, viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat, ix) NaOH/EtBr.\n\nOption C contains all the necessary reagents for the phenol-based pathway. The listed order is incorrect after the first two steps, and it includes sulfonation/desulfonation reagents which are not needed for this specific path, but it is the only option that starts correctly for what appears to be the most plausible chemical synthesis of the target molecule. The other options start with making tert-butylbenzene, and all pathways from that intermediate appear to lead to incorrect isomers or rely on extremely low-yield steps, contradicting the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of reactions that makes the most chemical sense can be constructed from the reagents listed in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
