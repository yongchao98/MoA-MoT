    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFirst, let's determine the energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The standard formula for these energy levels is:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}$, where *n* = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem provides a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. We need to express $E_n$ in terms of E.\nRecall that the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ is related to the Planck constant *h* by $\\hbar = h / (2\\pi)$, so $h = 2\\pi\\hbar$.\n\nSubstituting this into the formula for $E_n$:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 (2\\pi\\hbar)^2}{8mL^2} = \\frac{n^2 (4\\pi^2\\hbar^2)}{8mL^2} = n^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2mL^2} \\right)$\n\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels are simply:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\nThe first few energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### **2. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe problem states that we have four identical **spin-1/2 particles**. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions, which must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n\nFor this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level (quantum number *n*) and the spin state (spin up, $m_s = +1/2$, or spin down, $m_s = -1/2$). This means each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### **3. Calculating the State Energies**\n\nNow we can determine the total energy for the ground state and the first two excited states by filling the single-particle energy levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n#### **Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   Place the first two particles in the n=1 level. The energy for these two particles is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1E) = 2E$.\n*   Place the next two particles in the n=2 level. The energy for these two particles is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (4E) = 8E$.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{\\text{ground}} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n#### **First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n\nThe new configuration is:\n*   Two particles in the n=1 level (Energy: $2 \\times E_1 = 2E$)\n*   One particle in the n=2 level (Energy: $1 \\times E_2 = 4E$)\n*   One particle in the n=3 level (Energy: $1 \\times E_3 = 9E$)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{\\text{1st excited}} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n#### **Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider the different ways to create a higher-energy state and find the one with the lowest energy after the first excited state.\n\nLet's list the possible low-energy configurations and their total energies:\n*   **Ground State:** {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2} -> Energy = $2(1E) + 2(4E) = 10E$\n*   **1st Excited State:** {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3} -> Energy = $2(1E) + 1(4E) + 1(9E) = 15E$\n*   **Possibility A (Next Excitation):** Promote one particle from a lower level. Let's move a particle from n=1 to n=3, starting from the ground state configuration.\n    *   Configuration: {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy: $1(E_1) + 2(E_2) + 1(E_3) = 1(1E) + 2(4E) + 1(9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3}\n    *   Energy: $2(E_1) + 2(E_3) = 2(1E) + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the states we have found (10E, 15E, 18E, 20E,...), the third lowest unique energy is 18E.\nTherefore, the second excited state energy is 18E.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
