    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). We need to find the kinetic energies of the two product particles. We will use the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Given Information:**\n*   Decay reaction: Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu\n*   The initial particle, Pi(+), is stationary.\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+), m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c^2\n*   Rest mass of mu(+), m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c^2\n*   The neutrino (nu) is considered massless, so its rest mass, m_nu = 0.\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n    E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino. The total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and its rest mass energy (m*c^2).\n    E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu*c^2\n    E_nu = KE_nu + m_nu*c^2 = KE_nu (since m_nu = 0)\n    E_final = E_mu + E_nu = (KE_mu + m_mu*c^2) + KE_nu\n\n*   **Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n    E_initial = E_final\n    m_pi*c^2 = KE_mu + m_mu*c^2 + KE_nu\n    139.6 MeV = KE_mu + 105.7 MeV + KE_nu\n    KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 - 105.7\n    KE_mu + KE_nu = 33.9 MeV\n    This sum represents the total kinetic energy released in the decay, also known as the Q-value. Let's call this Equation (1).\n\n**3. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Initial Momentum (p_initial):** Since the pion is stationary, its momentum is zero.\n    p_initial = 0\n\n*   **Final Momentum (p_final):** The final momentum is the vector sum of the momenta of the muon (p_mu) and the neutrino (p_nu).\n    p_final = p_mu + p_nu\n\n*   **Applying Conservation of Momentum:**\n    p_initial = p_final\n    0 = p_mu + p_nu\n    p_mu = -p_nu\n    This means the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's denote this magnitude as 'p'.\n    |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\n\n**4. Solving for the Kinetic Energies:**\nWe can relate a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n\n*   **For the neutrino (massless):**\n    E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_nu*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + 0\n    E_nu = p*c\n    Since E_nu = KE_nu for a massless particle, we have:\n    KE_nu = p*c\n\n*   **For the muon:**\n    E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n    We can substitute p*c = KE_nu into this equation:\n    E_mu^2 = (KE_nu)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n    Also, we know E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu*c^2. So:\n    (KE_mu + m_mu*c^2)^2 = (KE_nu)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (KE_mu and KE_nu):\n(1) KE_mu + KE_nu = 33.9 MeV  =>  KE_mu = 33.9 - KE_nu\n(2) (KE_mu + m_mu*c^2)^2 = (KE_nu)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n\nSubstitute KE_mu from (1) into (2):\n( (33.9 - KE_nu) + m_mu*c^2 )^2 = (KE_nu)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\nExpand the left side:\n(33.9 - KE_nu)^2 + 2*(33.9 - KE_nu)*(m_mu*c^2) + (m_mu*c^2)^2 = (KE_nu)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\nCancel (m_mu*c^2)^2 from both sides and expand the first term:\n(33.9^2 - 2*33.9*KE_nu + KE_nu^2) + 2*(33.9 - KE_nu)*(m_mu*c^2) = (KE_nu)^2\nCancel KE_nu^2 from both sides:\n33.9^2 - 67.8*KE_nu + 2*33.9*(m_mu*c^2) - 2*KE_nu*(m_mu*c^2) = 0\nRearrange to solve for KE_nu:\n33.9^2 + 2*33.9*(m_mu*c^2) = KE_nu * (67.8 + 2*m_mu*c^2)\nKE_nu = (33.9^2 + 2 * 33.9 * m_mu*c^2) / (67.8 + 2 * m_mu*c^2)\n\nLet's use a simpler derivation that directly solves for one of the energies. From the energy and momentum conservation equations:\nm_pi*c^2 = E_mu + E_nu\np*c = E_nu\nE_mu = sqrt( (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2 )\n\nSubstitute these into the energy conservation equation:\nm_pi*c^2 = sqrt( E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2 ) + E_nu\nm_pi*c^2 - E_nu = sqrt( E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2 )\nSquare both sides:\n(m_pi*c^2 - E_nu)^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*E_nu + E_nu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\nCancel E_nu^2:\n(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 = 2*(m_pi*c^2)*E_nu\nE_nu = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi*c^2) ]\n\nSince E_nu = KE_nu, we can calculate the neutrino's kinetic energy.\n\n```python\n# Given values in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu)\n# Formula: KE_nu = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\nke_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is the remaining energy\nke_mu = q_value - ke_nu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV.\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78).\n\nThe pair of kinetic energies is (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV), which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a classic particle physics problem involving a two-body decay from rest. We will use the principles of conservation of relativistic energy and momentum to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. Identify Given Information:**\n*   Decay reaction: Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu\n*   The parent particle, the positive pion (Pi+), is at rest.\n*   Rest mass energy of Pi(+), E_pi = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of mu(+), E_mu_rest = m_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (nu) is considered massless, so its rest mass m_nu = 0.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n**a) Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is its rest mass energy.\n    E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):** This is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_mu) and the neutrino (E_nu).\n    E_final = E_mu + E_nu\n    The total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and rest mass energy.\n    E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu*c^2\n    E_nu = KE_nu + m_nu*c^2 = KE_nu (since m_nu = 0)\n*   Equating initial and final energy:\n    m_pi*c^2 = (KE_mu + m_mu*c^2) + KE_nu\n    139.6 MeV = KE_mu + 105.7 MeV + KE_nu\n    KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV\n    This value (33.9 MeV) is the total kinetic energy released in the decay, often called the Q-value.\n\n**b) Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Initial Momentum (p_initial):** Since the pion is stationary, its momentum is zero.\n*   **Final Momentum (p_final):** The two product particles must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let 'p' be the magnitude of the momentum for both the muon and the neutrino.\n    |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\n\n**3. Relate Energy and Momentum:**\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n\n*   **For the neutrino (massless):**\n    E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + 0  =>  E_nu = p*c\n    Since E_nu = KE_nu for a massless particle, we have **KE_nu = p*c**.\n\n*   **For the muon:**\n    E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n    We can substitute p*c = KE_nu into this equation:\n    E_mu^2 = (KE_nu)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n    Also, E_mu = m_pi*c^2 - E_nu = m_pi*c^2 - KE_nu.\n    So, (m_pi*c^2 - KE_nu)^2 = (KE_nu)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n\n**4. Solve for Kinetic Energies:**\nLet's expand the equation from the previous step to solve for KE_nu:\n(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi*c^2)(KE_nu) + (KE_nu)^2 = (KE_nu)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\nThe (KE_nu)^2 terms on both sides cancel out.\n(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 = 2(m_pi*c^2)(KE_nu)\nKE_nu = [(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2] / [2 * (m_pi*c^2)]\n\nNow we can plug in the values and calculate. To ensure precision, we'll use a short python script.\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) using the derived formula.\n# KE_nu = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\nke_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The total kinetic energy is the Q-value of the decay.\nQ_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is the remaining kinetic energy.\nke_mu = Q_value - ke_nu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places.\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_mu): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_nu): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nThe calculation shows that the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.78 MeV, which we can round to 29.8 MeV.\n\nComparing our results (KE_mu ≈ 4.12 MeV, KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV) with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
