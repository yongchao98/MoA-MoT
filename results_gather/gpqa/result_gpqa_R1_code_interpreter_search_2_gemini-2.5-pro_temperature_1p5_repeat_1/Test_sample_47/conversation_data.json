    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone will react with bromine, typically under acidic conditions (which can be generated in situ or from impurities), to substitute a bromine atom for a hydrogen atom on the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone. The two α-carbons of cyclohexanone are equivalent, so only one monobrominated product is formed.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction involves an α-halo ketone with an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon (α'-position). In the presence of a strong base like NaOH, this substrate undergoes a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes the acidic α'-proton (from C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the strained carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The ring opens to form a more stable carbanion, which leads to the contraction of the six-membered ring into a five-membered ring.\n    5.  Protonation of the resulting carboxylate during workup yields a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. An alternative elimination reaction to form cyclohex-2-enone is less likely because the subsequent reaction with thionyl chloride is not a standard transformation for an α,β-unsaturated ketone, whereas its reaction with a carboxylic acid is.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a reduction of an acid chloride. LiAlH(OtBu)₃ is a sterically hindered and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without continuing the reduction to the primary alcohol. This is a well-known selective reduction.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analyzing the Structure of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this molecule, which corresponds to the number of signals we would expect in a proton NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons (let's call it C1).\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Due to rapid ring puckering and rotation about the C1-CHO bond, the molecule has a time-averaged plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (C-H and C=O bonds), the C1 carbon and its attached hydrogen, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n\nThis plane of symmetry has the following consequences:\n*   The carbon C2 is chemically equivalent to C5.\n*   The carbon C3 is chemically equivalent to C4.\n*   The protons attached to equivalent carbons will also be related by this symmetry.\n\nNow let's count the distinct proton environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is a methine proton (CH) attached to the aldehyde group. It is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These carbons are equivalent. Let's look at the two protons on C2. They are on a carbon adjacent to a prochiral center (C1). Therefore, the two protons on C2 are **diastereotopic** and are not chemically equivalent. The same applies to C5. By symmetry, the two non-equivalent protons on C2 are equivalent to their counterparts on C5. So, the four protons on C2 and C5 give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These carbons are equivalent. Similar to the case for C2/C5, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic because of the overall molecular environment. They are not chemically equivalent. The same applies to C4. By symmetry, the four protons on C3 and C4 give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Aldehyde H: 1\n*   C1-H: 1\n*   C2/C5-H: 2\n*   C3/C4-H: 2\n*   **Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<D>>>"
