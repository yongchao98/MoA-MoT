    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula be CxHy. The mass fraction of H is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n    *   This fraction `14.28%` is very close to `1/7` (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`).\n    *   If the mass fraction is `1/7`, then `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` => `7y = 12x + y` => `6y = 12x` => `y = 2x`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen and is part of mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). All fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   One of these liquids is Z (a cycloalkane, CnH2n).\n    *   The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yields only Z. Let the other component be D.\n    *   So, D + H2 -> Z.\n    *   Since D is in mixture Y, it does not decolorize bromine water. For a substance D to be hydrogenated to a cycloalkane Z (CnH2n) but not decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic hydrocarbon (arene). The hydrogenation of arenes to cycloalkanes requires severe conditions (high pressure/temperature), which aligns with the problem description.\n    *   Therefore, Y is an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (Z) and its corresponding arene (D).\n    *   This implies Z and D have the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   Plausible pairs for (D, Z) are (Benzene C6H6, Cyclohexane C6H12) or (Toluene C7H8, Methylcyclohexane C7H14). For both cases, the general formulas are D = CnH(2n-6) and Z = CnH2n (for single-ring aromatics).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   X contains no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X (both A and B) gives only Z (CnH2n). This means A and B are unsaturated hydrocarbons with the same carbon skeleton as Z. So, A and B are CnHx and CnHy.\n    *   The reaction is X -> Y, which is a disproportionation reaction producing an equimolar mixture. This suggests a 1:1 stoichiometry:\n        A + B -> Z + D\n    *   Let's perform a hydrogen atom balance on this reaction:\n        H_atoms(A) + H_atoms(B) = H_atoms(Z) + H_atoms(D)\n        x + y = (2n) + (2n-6)\n        x + y = 4n - 6\n\n4.  **Determine the specific formulas of A and B**\n    *   A and B are non-conjugated, unsaturated versions of Z (CnH2n).\n    *   The simplest and most common unsaturated hydrocarbons are alkenes (with one double bond) and alkadienes (with two double bonds).\n    *   Let A be the cycloalkene: its formula is CnH(2n-2).\n    *   Let B be the non-conjugated cycloalkadiene: its formula is CnH(2n-4).\n    *   Let's check if this choice for A and B satisfies the hydrogen balance:\n        Sum of hydrogens = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n - 6.\n    *   This perfectly matches the hydrogen balance derived from the products. So, the components of mixture X are a cycloalkene CnH(2n-2) and a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene CnH(2n-4).\n\n5.  **Solve for 'n' and Find the Final Answer**\n    *   We have two plausible scenarios based on common solvents:\n        *   **Scenario 1 (n=6):** The C6 system.\n            *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n            *   D = Benzene (C6H6)\n            *   A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n            *   B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8), which is non-conjugated.\n            *   This system fits all the conditions of the problem.\n        *   **Scenario 2 (n=7):** The C7 system.\n            *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14)\n            *   D = Toluene (C7H8)\n            *   A = Methylcyclohexene (C7H12)\n            *   B = A non-conjugated Methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10).\n            *   This system also fits all the conditions.\n\n    *   The problem is designed to have a single answer. In chemistry problems of this nature, when a fundamental chemical transformation is described, it usually refers to the parent (unsubstituted) system unless specified otherwise. The catalytic hydrogen transfer between cycloalkenes/dienes and the resulting formation of cyclohexane and benzene is a classic, textbook reaction (Zelinsky catalysis). The C7 system is a homologous variant. Therefore, it is most reasonable to assume the problem refers to the C6 system.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final result**\n    *   Assuming n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are:\n        *   Liquid 1 (A): Cyclohexene (C6H10), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Liquid 2 (B): Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (i.e., in one molecule of each).\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
