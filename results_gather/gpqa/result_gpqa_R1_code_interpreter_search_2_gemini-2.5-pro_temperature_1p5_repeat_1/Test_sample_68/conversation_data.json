    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves a relativistic particle that decays. Because the particle is moving at high speed, its lifetime in the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber) is longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation. Consequently, the distance it travels before decaying (the decay length) is also longer than what it would be at non-relativistic speeds. The decay of particles is a random process, following an exponential decay law.\n\n2.  **Define \"Observing a Decay\":** To \"observe\" a decay, we need to be able to see the track of the parent particle ($X^0$) before it decays into its daughter particles ($Y^+$ and $Z^-$). This means the track length, let's call it $L$, must be larger than the detector's resolution, $d_{res}$. If $L \\le d_{res}$, the decay vertex is indistinguishable from the creation point, and the track is not resolved.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Condition:** The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". This means we need to find a resolution, $d_{res}$, such that the probability of the track length $L$ being greater than $d_{res}$ is at least 0.3.\n    $P(L > d_{res}) \\ge 0.3$\n\n4.  **Formulate the Mathematical Condition:** The probability distribution of decay lengths follows an exponential law, $P(L) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} e^{-L/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n    The probability of a particle traveling a distance greater than $d_{res}$ before decaying is:\n    $P(L > d_{res}) = \\int_{d_{res}}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\lambda} e^{-x/\\lambda} dx = [-e^{-x/\\lambda}]_{d_{res}}^{\\infty} = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$.\n    So, the condition is:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.3$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-d_{res}/\\lambda \\ge \\ln(0.3)$\n    $d_{res}/\\lambda \\le -\\ln(0.3) = \\ln(1/0.3) = \\ln(10/3)$\n    $d_{res} \\le \\lambda \\ln(10/3)$\n\n5.  **Interpret \"Minimum Resolution\":** A smaller value of $d_{res}$ means a better (finer) resolution. The condition $d_{res} \\le \\lambda \\ln(10/3)$ sets an upper bound on the resolvable distance. The phrase \"minimum resolution needed\" can be interpreted as asking for the coarsest (largest) resolution value that still satisfies the condition. Therefore, we are looking for the maximum allowed value of $d_{res}$.\n    $d_{res, max} = \\lambda \\ln(10/3)$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    First, we need to calculate the relativistic factors. The mean decay length in the lab frame is given by $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau_{lab}$ is its lifetime in the lab frame.\n    -   $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime.\n    -   $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n    So, $\\lambda = c \\beta \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    The term $\\beta\\gamma$ can be calculated from the total energy $E$ and the rest mass energy $m_0c^2$:\n    $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n    $p = \\gamma m_0 v = \\gamma m_0 (\\beta c) \\implies pc = (\\gamma\\beta) m_0c^2$\n    Substituting this into the energy-momentum relation:\n    $E^2 = ((\\gamma\\beta) m_0c^2)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n    $(\\gamma\\beta)^2 = \\frac{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}{(m_0c^2)^2} \\implies \\gamma\\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}}{m_0c^2}$\n\n7.  **Compute the Values:** We'll use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values from the problem statement\nE_GeV = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2_GeV = 3.41 # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0_s = 8e-16 # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc_ms = 299792458 # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate beta*gamma\nbeta_gamma = np.sqrt(E_GeV**2 - m0c2_GeV**2) / m0c2_GeV\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in the lab frame\nlmbda = c_ms * tau0_s * beta_gamma\n\n# Calculate the maximum allowed resolution (d_res, max)\n# d_res <= lambda * ln(10/3)\nd_res_max = lmbda * np.log(10.0/3.0)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated mean decay length is lambda = {lmbda:.3e} m\")\nprint(f\"The maximum allowed resolution is d_res_max = {d_res_max:.3e} m\")\n\n```\nThe execution of the above code provides the following results:\n-   The mean decay length, $\\lambda = 1.884 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n-   The maximum required resolution, $d_{res, max} = \\lambda \\times \\ln(10/3) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} \\times 1.204 = 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The condition is that the resolution $d_{res}$ must be less than or equal to $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's check the given options:\n    A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m (too large)\n    B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m (sufficient)\n    C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m (sufficient)\n    D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m (too large)\n\nBoth B and C are valid resolutions. However, the question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\". This usually implies the boundary condition or the value closest to it. Option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close to the calculated maximum allowed value ($2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and is of the correct order of magnitude for the decay length. Option B, while technically sufficient, represents a much higher (and possibly unnecessary) level of precision. Therefore, C is the most reasonable answer. The small discrepancy between the calculated limit and the value in option C might be due to rounding of the input values in the problem statement. For instance, if the energy were 30 GeV instead of 27 GeV, the mean decay length $\\lambda$ would be approximately $2.096 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, making option C an even more direct fit. Given the provided numbers, we choose the closest valid option.\n\nWith a resolution of $d_{res} = 2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, the fraction of observed decays is $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = e^{-2.08/1.884} \\approx e^{-1.104} \\approx 0.33$, which satisfies the condition of being greater than 30%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the necessary spatial resolution of a detector (the Bubble Chamber) to observe the decay track of a particle, $X^0$. The condition is that at least 30% of the decay events must be observable.\n\n2.  **Understand the Physics of Decay and Observation:**\n    *   A particle's decay is a random process. The number of undecayed particles, N(t), at time t follows an exponential decay law: $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau_{lab}}$, where $\\tau_{lab}$ is the mean lifetime of the particle in the laboratory frame.\n    *   Correspondingly, the probability that a single particle travels a distance $L$ before decaying also follows an exponential law: $P(L) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} e^{-L/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n    *   To \"observe\" a decay, the track left by the particle $X^0$ must be long enough to be distinguished from its creation point. This means its decay length, $L$, must be greater than the detector's resolution, let's call it $d_{res}$. If $L \\le d_{res}$, the track is unresolved.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mathematical Condition:**\n    *   We need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This translates to the probability of the decay length being greater than the resolution being at least 0.30.\n    *   $P(L > d_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n    *   This probability is calculated by integrating the probability density function from $d_{res}$ to infinity:\n        $P(L > d_{res}) = \\int_{d_{res}}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\lambda} e^{-x/\\lambda} dx = [-e^{-x/\\lambda}]_{d_{res}}^{\\infty} = 0 - (-e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n    *   So, the condition becomes:\n        $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Resolution ($d_{res}$):**\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        $\\ln(e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}) \\ge \\ln(0.3)$\n        $-d_{res}/\\lambda \\ge \\ln(0.3)$\n    *   Multiply by $-\\lambda$ and reverse the inequality sign (since $\\lambda$ is positive):\n        $d_{res} \\le -\\lambda \\ln(0.3) = \\lambda \\ln(1/0.3) = \\lambda \\ln(10/3)$\n    *   This inequality tells us the maximum allowable value for the resolution. A finer resolution (smaller $d_{res}$) will observe an even greater percentage of decays. The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed,\" which in this context means the coarsest (largest) resolution value that still meets the 30% requirement. We need to find the value of $d_{res,max} = \\lambda \\ln(10/3)$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$) in the Laboratory Frame:**\n    *   The mean decay length is the distance the particle travels, on average, before decaying in the lab frame. It is given by $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau_{lab}$ is its lifetime in the lab.\n    *   The lifetime is subject to relativistic time dilation: $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime.\n    *   The velocity is $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\lambda = (\\beta c)(\\gamma \\tau_0) = (\\beta \\gamma) c \\tau_0$.\n    *   We can calculate the product $\\beta \\gamma$ from the particle's total energy ($E$) and its rest mass energy ($m_0 c^2$). The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$. We also know that momentum $p = \\gamma m_0 v = (\\beta\\gamma) m_0c$.\n    *   So, $E^2 = ((\\beta\\gamma)m_0c^2)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   Solving for $\\beta\\gamma$:\n        $(\\beta\\gamma)^2 = \\frac{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}{(m_0c^2)^2} \\implies \\beta\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}}{m_0c^2}$\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   Total energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n        *   Rest mass energy, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        *   Speed of light, $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   **Calculation steps were performed using the Python code:**\n        *   First, calculate $\\beta\\gamma$:\n          $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2}}{3.41} = \\frac{\\sqrt{729 - 11.6281}}{3.41} \\approx 7.85$\n        *   Then, calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$:\n          $\\lambda = (\\beta\\gamma) c \\tau_0 \\approx 7.85 \\times (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n        *   Finally, calculate the maximum required resolution $d_{res,max}$:\n          $d_{res,max} = \\lambda \\ln(10/3) \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times \\ln(3.333...) \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculation shows that the detector resolution $d_{res}$ must be less than or equal to $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    *   Let's review the options:\n        A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n        B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n        C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n        D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n    *   Options A and D are too large (coarse resolution) and do not meet the condition.\n    *   Options B ($0.00208 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) both satisfy the condition $d_{res} \\le 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    *   However, Option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is the value closest to the calculated limit. It represents the coarsest resolution (and thus the \"minimum\" requirement in an engineering sense) that works. The small difference between the calculated $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m and the option's $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is typical for such problems due to rounding of input values. Option C is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
