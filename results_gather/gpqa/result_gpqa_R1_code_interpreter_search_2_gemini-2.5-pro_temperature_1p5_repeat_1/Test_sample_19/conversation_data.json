    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n**1. Analyze the core concept: Impulse Approximation**\n\nThe term \"impulse\" refers to an interaction that happens over a very short time. The approximation, in essence, is that the interaction with a nucleon inside a nucleus is so quick that it can be treated as an interaction with a free nucleon. We need to break down what this implies.\n\n*   **Treating it like a free nucleon:** A free nucleon is not bound by the strong force to other nucleons. This means that during the interaction, we must ignore the forces from the surrounding nucleons (the nuclear binding potential).\n*   **Interaction with *a* nucleon:** The approximation assumes the probe (e.g., an electron, a neutrino) interacts with a single, individual nucleon rather than with a cluster of them or the nucleus as a whole.\n*   **Overall process:** For the calculation to be simple and truly mimic a free-nucleon interaction, what happens *after* the initial collision is also important. If the struck nucleon immediately scatters off another nucleon, the final state is very different from a free-nucleon interaction.\n\n**2. Evaluate each statement:**\n\n*   **Statement 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    *   This is the fundamental starting point. To treat the target as *a* nucleon, you have to assume the interaction is with only one nucleon. This is often called the \"single-nucleon current\" assumption and is a prerequisite for the impulse approximation. This statement is **necessary**.\n\n*   **Statement 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    *   This addresses what happens *after* the initial, impulsive interaction. It states that the particles leaving the interaction site (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) do not interact with the other nucleons on their way out. This is an assumption that there are no \"Final State Interactions\" (FSI). While sometimes treated as a separate approximation (leading to the \"Plane Wave Impulse Approximation\" or PWIA), it is crucial for making the overall process resemble a clean, free-nucleon scattering event. Ignoring FSIs is a key part of the simplified picture the impulse approximation aims to create. This statement is **necessary** for the simplest form of the approximation.\n\n*   **Statement 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    *   This is an assumption about the internal structure of the nucleon itself (i.e., its composition in terms of quarks and gluons). The impulse approximation deals with the nucleon as a whole entity and its relationship with the nuclear environment. Whether the quarks inside it are treated as relativistic or non-relativistic is a question for the model of the nucleon itself (e.g., in a quark model vs. using experimentally determined form factors), not a condition for the impulse approximation. One can apply the impulse approximation without making any specific assumptions about the quark dynamics, other than that they are confined within the nucleon. Therefore, this statement is **not necessary**.\n\n*   **Statement 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    *   This is the very definition of \"impulse.\" The interaction is assumed to be so rapid (high energy and momentum transfer) that the relatively slow-acting binding forces from other nucleons can be ignored *during the moment of interaction*. The energy exchanged is assumed to be much greater than the nucleon's binding energy. This statement is the core physical idea behind the approximation and is **necessary**.\n\n**3. Synthesize the results:**\n\nThe necessary assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are:\n*   The interaction is with a single nucleon (Statement 1).\n*   The binding forces are negligible during the interaction (Statement 4).\n*   The outgoing particles do not re-interact with the nucleus (Statement 2).\n\nTherefore, the required assumptions are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
