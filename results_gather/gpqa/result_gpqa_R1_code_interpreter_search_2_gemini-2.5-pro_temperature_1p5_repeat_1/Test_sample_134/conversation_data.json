    "The user wants to determine the kinematically allowed decay channels for a boson X with a mass of $m_X = 6$ GeV.\n\n1.  **Understand the interaction:** The given Lagrangian is\n    $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) X(y) \\psi_f(y)$.\n    This term describes a vertex where the boson X couples to a fermion-antifermion pair ($\\bar{\\psi}_f$, $\\psi_f$). This means that the boson X can decay into a fermion and its corresponding antifermion, i.e., $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\n2.  **Kinematic Condition:** For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the initial particle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the final particles. In this case, for the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$:\n    $m_X \\geq m_f + m_{\\bar{f}}$\n    Since a fermion and its antifermion have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n    $m_X \\geq 2m_f$\n\n3.  **Apply the condition:** We are given $m_X = 6$ GeV. Therefore, the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$ is allowed for all fundamental fermions $f$ whose mass satisfies:\n    $6 \\text{ GeV} \\geq 2m_f$\n    or\n    $m_f \\leq 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n4.  **Check fermion masses:** We need to compare the masses of all fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) to this 3 GeV threshold. The approximate masses of the fermions are:\n\n    *   **Quarks:**\n        *   up (u): ~2.2 MeV = 0.0022 GeV\n        *   down (d): ~4.7 MeV = 0.0047 GeV\n        *   strange (s): ~95 MeV = 0.095 GeV\n        *   charm (c): ~1.27 GeV\n        *   bottom (b): ~4.18 GeV\n        *   top (t): ~173 GeV\n\n    *   **Leptons:**\n        *   electron (e): ~0.511 MeV = 0.000511 GeV\n        *   muon ($\\mu$): ~105.7 MeV = 0.1057 GeV\n        *   tau ($\\tau$): ~1.777 GeV\n        *   neutrinos ($\\nu_e, \\nu_\\mu, \\nu_\\tau$): very small, less than 1 eV. While decays to neutrinos are kinematically allowed, they are not listed in the options and typically have much smaller couplings.\n\n5.  **Identify allowed decays:** We select all fermions with a mass less than 3 GeV:\n    *   **Quarks:**\n        *   up (u): $m_u \\approx 0.0022 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$  (Allowed) $\\implies X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$\n        *   down (d): $m_d \\approx 0.0047 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$  (Allowed) $\\implies X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$\n        *   strange (s): $m_s \\approx 0.095 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$  (Allowed) $\\implies X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$\n        *   charm (c): $m_c \\approx 1.27 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$  (Allowed) $\\implies X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$\n        *   bottom (b): $m_b \\approx 4.18 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$  (Forbidden)\n        *   top (t): $m_t \\approx 173 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$  (Forbidden)\n    *   **Leptons:**\n        *   electron (e): $m_e \\approx 0.0005 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$  (Allowed) $\\implies X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$\n        *   muon ($\\mu$): $m_\\mu \\approx 0.106 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$  (Allowed) $\\implies X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$\n        *   tau ($\\tau$): $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$  (Allowed) $\\implies X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$\n\n6.  **Compile the list of allowed decays:**\n    The kinematically allowed decays are to pairs of up, down, strange, and charm quarks, and to electron-positron, muon-antimuon, and tau-antitau pairs.\n    List: $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Includes $t\\bar{t}$, which is forbidden)\n    B) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Matches our list of allowed decays)\n    C) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Includes $b\\bar{b}$, which is forbidden, and omits $c\\bar{c}$)\n    D) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Includes $b\\bar{b}$, and omits $c\\bar{c}$ and $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
