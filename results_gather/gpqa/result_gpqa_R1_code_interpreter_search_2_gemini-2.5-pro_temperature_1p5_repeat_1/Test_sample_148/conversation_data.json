    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data provided:**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. This means this proton exists in two different chemical environments. The integrals are roughly equal, suggesting the two environments are populated in approximately a 1:1 ratio. The similar chemical shifts imply the two environments are structurally very similar. Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause.\n    *   **LC-MS:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude mixture into two distinct peaks. This confirms the presence of two different chemical species that have different physical properties (allowing for separation on the LC column). The mass spectrometry (MS) shows that both of these separated species have the exact same mass, and this mass corresponds to the expected product.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the possible explanations based on the data:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In an achiral environment (like a standard NMR solvent or a standard LC column), they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce only a *single* peak in the ¹H NMR and a *single* peak in a standard LC analysis. To separate or distinguish enantiomers, you would need a chiral environment (e.g., a chiral LC column or a chiral shift reagent in the NMR). Since the problem describes standard analysis techniques, this option is inconsistent with the observation of two separate peaks.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This typically occurs in molecules with two or more stereocenters. Unlike enantiomers, diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC. This is consistent with the two peaks observed in the LC run.\n        *   Because they are different compounds, corresponding protons (like the alpha-proton in question) exist in slightly different chemical environments. This would lead to two different peaks in the ¹H NMR spectrum. This is consistent with the NMR data.\n        *   Because they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and therefore the same mass. This is consistent with the MS data.\n        *   In peptide chemistry, this situation is common. It can arise from epimerization (racemization) of one chiral center during synthesis, or from the presence of slowly interconverting rotational isomers (atropisomers), such as the *cis* and *trans* isomers of an amide bond involving a proline residue. Both epimers and stable rotational isomers are types of diastereomers. This explanation fits all the experimental evidence.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** Double coupling would mean that an extra amino acid was added to the peptide, likely at a side-chain amine. This would result in a product with a *higher molecular weight* than the expected molecule. Since the MS data shows both peaks have the *same, expected* mass, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor (like a starting material or an incompletely reacted peptide fragment) would have a *different, lower molecular weight* than the final product. The MS data shows both peaks have the same, expected mass of the final product, ruling out contamination with a precursor.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only explanation that is consistent with all pieces of experimental data (two NMR peaks, two separable LC peaks, and identical mass for both peaks) is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
