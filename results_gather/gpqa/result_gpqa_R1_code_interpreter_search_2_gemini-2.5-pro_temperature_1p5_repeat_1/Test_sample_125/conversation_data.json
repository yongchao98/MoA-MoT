    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has one stereocenter at carbon C5, and its configuration is specified as (S). The molecule is chiral and enantiomerically pure.\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The ketone group at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is chiral, the attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) on the planar sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbon is not equally likely from both faces. The existing stereocenter at C5 directs the attack, leading to the formation of two products in unequal amounts. These two products are diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct stereoisomeric products (diastereomers) are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has no stereocenters and possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Transformation:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups. \"Excess\" ensures both ketones react. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Product structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:** The product has two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed.\n    *   Possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are a pair of enantiomers. Since the reaction is not stereospecific, they will be formed as a racemic mixture (equal amounts).\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through C3). Therefore, it is a meso compound and is achiral. The (2S, 4R) form is identical to the (2R, 4S) form (just flip the molecule over).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed: the meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the products and analyze with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Total products in the mixture:** We have 2 products from Reaction I and 3 products from Reaction II, for a total of 5 unique stereoisomers.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (i.e., (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n    4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Principle of Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n    *   **Constitutional isomers** (different connectivity) have different polarities and are separated.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties, including polarity, and are separated.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (including polarity) and are *not* separated. They co-elute as a single peak.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   Products 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They will be separated. (2 peaks)\n    *   Products 4 and 5 are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will form a single peak.\n    *   Product 3 (meso) is a diastereomer of products 4 and 5. It will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak.\n    *   So, the three products from Reaction II will give two peaks: one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair. (2 peaks)\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are constitutional isomers of the products from Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂). They have different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities, so their peaks will be well-separated from the peaks of Reaction II products.\n*   **Total peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined products with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with different stereoisomers, including enantiomers. It can separate all molecules that are not identical.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:** We have 5 unique, non-identical stereoisomers in our mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically distinct, a chiral HPLC column is capable of separating all of them. Each will have a unique retention time.\n*   **Total peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
