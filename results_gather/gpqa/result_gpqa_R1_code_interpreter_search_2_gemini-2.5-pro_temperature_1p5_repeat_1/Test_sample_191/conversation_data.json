    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Induced Charges:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the conductor, it induces charges on the surfaces of the conductor due to electrostatic induction.\n    *   To make the electric field inside the conducting material zero (as it must be in electrostatic equilibrium), a charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law applied to a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity. The net charge enclosed must be zero, so `q_enclosed = +q + q_induced_inner = 0`, which means `q_induced_inner = -q`.\n    *   The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has been induced on the inner surface, to conserve the total charge of the conductor (which is zero), a charge of `+q` must be induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields created by charges inside it. The combined electric field from the original charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall is zero everywhere outside the cavity. Therefore, these charges do not contribute to the electric field at point P.\n\n3.  **Field from the Outer Surface:** The electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is created *only* by the charge present on the outer surface of the conductor. As determined in step 1, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n\n4.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** Since the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere and there are no other external charges in the problem, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over this outer spherical surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at a point outside the shell is identical to the electric field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude placed at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface: `+q`.\n    *   Center of the outer sphere: The center of the spherical conductor, O.\n    *   Distance of the point P from the center O: `L`.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The information about the cavity's radius `r`, its displacement `s` from the center, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to P, and the angle `\\theta` are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor, due to the shielding effect. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
