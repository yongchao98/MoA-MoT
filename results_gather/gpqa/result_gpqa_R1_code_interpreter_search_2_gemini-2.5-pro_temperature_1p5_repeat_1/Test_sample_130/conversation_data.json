    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene, dehydrated to an anhydride:** The spectral data for the anhydride (¹H NMR: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   The single ¹H peak at ~7 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the double bond.\n        *   The ¹³C peak at ~137 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent alkene carbons.\n        *   The ¹³C peak at ~165 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n    *   **The diene:** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a cyclic diene with methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction is known to produce two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the Alder-Fieser rule (or endo rule), the **endo adduct is typically the major product** under kinetic control, while the *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the adduct is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structures of the Endo and Exo Products:**\n    *   Both products have a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene skeleton.\n    *   Let's identify the different types of protons in the product:\n        *   **H_anhydride:** The two protons on the carbons that came from maleic anhydride (C2 and C3 of the new bicyclic system). Due to a plane of symmetry, these two protons are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. Being alpha to carbonyl groups, they will be deshielded, expected around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **H_bridge:** The two protons on the one-carbon bridge (C7), which came from the C5 of the cyclopentadiene. These two protons are diastereotopic (one points towards the C=C bond, `syn`, and one points away, `anti`). They will appear as two separate signals, likely coupled to each other as doublets. They are on a saturated bridge and should be relatively shielded, expected around **~1.5-2.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Me_vinyl:** The two methyl groups on the double bond (C5, C6). They are equivalent by symmetry and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typical for vinylic methyls, around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Me_bridgehead:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). They are equivalent by symmetry and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Being on saturated carbons, they will be the most shielded, expected around **~1.0 ppm**.\n\n4.  **Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   NOESY shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states there is a cross-peak present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product. This cross-peak is the key to identifying the stereochemistry and the interacting protons.\n    *   **In the major (*endo*) product:** The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the C5-C6 double bond. This geometry brings the **H_anhydride** protons very close to the bridge protons (**H_bridge**), specifically the one that is `syn` to the double bond. Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak is expected between the signals for **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge**.\n    *   **In the minor (*exo*) product:** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the C5-C6 double bond. In this configuration, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. Instead, they are closer to the bridgehead methyl groups (**Me_bridgehead**).\n    *   The observation that a cross-peak is present in the major product and absent in the minor one strongly indicates that this is the NOE between **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge**.\n\n5.  **Match the Interacting Protons to the Options:**\n    *   We are looking for the resonances corresponding to **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge**.\n    *   Based on our chemical shift analysis:\n        *   The resonance for **H_anhydride** is the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   The resonance for one of the **H_bridge** protons is the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. (The signal is described as a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other, diastereotopic bridge proton).\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`). This interaction is not the primary distinguishing feature between the endo and exo isomers.\n    *   B) **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_bridge`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`)**. This matches our analysis perfectly. This NOE is strong in the *endo* (major) product and absent in the *exo* (minor) product.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_bridge`). This interaction does not involve the anhydride protons whose position defines the stereoisomer.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`). This is an interaction between methyl groups and is not the key differentiator.\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
