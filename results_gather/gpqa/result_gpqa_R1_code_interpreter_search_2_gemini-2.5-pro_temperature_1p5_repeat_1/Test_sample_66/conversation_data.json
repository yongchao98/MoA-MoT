    "An explanation of the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:** We are performing a measurement of the z-component of the orbital angular momentum for each electron individually, i.e., measuring the observables $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Desired Outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of getting the following measurement results:\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principle of Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual z-components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship also holds for their corresponding quantum numbers: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Contradiction:**\n    *   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. This means that if we were to measure the total z-component of the angular momentum, we would get the value $-1\\hbar$ with 100% certainty.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome has $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. If this outcome were to occur, the total z-component of angular momentum for the system would be $m_{measured} = m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   This creates a contradiction. The system is known to have a total z-component quantum number $m=-1$, but the desired measurement outcome corresponds to a total z-component quantum number of $m=-2$. A measurement cannot change the value of a quantity if the system is already in an eigenstate of the corresponding operator.\n    *   Therefore, it is impossible to obtain the desired measurement outcome. The probability of an impossible event is 0.\n\n6.  **Formal Approach using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The probability of measuring the system in the state with $m_1$ and $m_2$ when it is in the state $|l, m\\rangle$ is given by the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient in the expansion of the coupled state into the uncoupled basis.\n    *   The coupled state can be written as:\n        $|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 \\rangle$\n        where $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n    *   The probability of finding the system with individual quantum numbers $m_1$ and $m_2$ is:\n        $P(m_1, m_2) = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$\n    *   We want to find the probability for $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n        $P(-1, -1) = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n    *   A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are zero unless $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   In our case, $m = -1$, and $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is $P(-1, -1) = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nBoth lines of reasoning lead to the same conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>"
