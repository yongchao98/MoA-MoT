    "The user wants me to find the value of the constant 'a' for a given quantum mechanical wave function.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principle:**\nThe fundamental principle here is the normalization of the wave function. The total probability of finding the particle anywhere in the space it is allowed to exist must be 1. The probability density is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|². Therefore, the integral of the probability density over the allowed region must equal 1.\n\n**2. Define the Wave Function and its Complex Conjugate:**\nThe wave function is given as:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe complex conjugate, ψ*(x), is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability Density Function |ψ(x)|²:**\nThe probability density is the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate:\n|ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) * ψ(x)\n|ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\n\nThis is in the form (A + B) * (A - B), which simplifies to A² - B².\nHere, A = a / sqrt(1 + x) and B = 0.5i.\n|ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5i)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * i²)\n\nSince i² = -1:\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * -1)\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**4. Set up the Normalization Integral:**\nThe problem states that the particles are only found between x = 1 and x = 3. This means the normalization integral must be evaluated over this range.\n∫[from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\n**5. Solve the Integral:**\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\n*   **First part:**\n    ∫ ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx = a² * ∫ ( 1 / (1 + x) ) dx = a² * ln(1 + x)\n    Evaluating from 1 to 3:\n    a² * [ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)] = a² * [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\n*   **Second part:**\n    ∫ 0.25 dx = 0.25x\n    Evaluating from 1 to 3:\n    0.25 * (3) - 0.25 * (1) = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5\n\n**6. Combine the results and solve for 'a':**\nPutting the two parts back into the equation:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, we solve for 'a':\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )\n\n**7. Calculate the Numerical Value:**\nTo get the final numerical value for 'a', I will use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of a squared\n# a^2 = 0.5 / ln(2)\na_squared = 0.5 / math.log(2)\n\n# Calculate a by taking the square root\na = math.sqrt(a_squared)\n\nprint(a)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
