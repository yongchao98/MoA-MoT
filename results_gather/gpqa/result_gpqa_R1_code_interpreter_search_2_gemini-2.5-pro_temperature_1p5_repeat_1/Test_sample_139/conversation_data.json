    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substances X, Y, W, G, and B**\n\n1.  **\"The melting point of B ... is very close to 277 K.\"**\n    *   277 Kelvin is equal to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   Therefore, **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **\"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"**\n    *   Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope involved is Deuterium (D), an isotope of Hydrogen (H).\n    *   This means **Substance X contains Deuterium**.\n\n3.  **\"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O).\"**\n    *   This means G is a deuterated solid that decomposes upon heating to yield D₂O. A deuterated metal hydroxide, like Al(OD)₃, fits this description (2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O).\n\n4.  **\"Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**\n    *   Substance X contains Deuterium. Let's assume it's a deuteride (M-D). It reacts with a liquid Y. Let's test possibilities for Y and the resulting gas W.\n    *   Case 1: Y is normal water (H₂O). The reaction would be M-D + H₂O → M-OH + HD (gas). Let's check the protons and neutrons in HD gas.\n        *   H = 1 proton, 0 neutrons. D = 1 proton, 1 neutron.\n        *   HD molecule = 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Protons ≠ Neutrons). This case is incorrect.\n    *   Case 2: Y is heavy water (D₂O). The reaction would be M-D + D₂O → M-OD + D₂ (gas). Let's check the protons and neutrons in D₂ gas.\n        *   D = 1 proton, 1 neutron.\n        *   D₂ molecule = 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Protons = Neutrons). This case is correct.\n    *   Therefore, **gas W is Deuterium gas (D₂) and liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n5.  **\"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"** and **\"Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y (D₂O)...\"**\n    *   We are looking for a common deuterated reagent whose non-deuterated analog is a staple in organic chemistry, and it reacts violently with water/heavy water.\n    *   Two major candidates are Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄, analog NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄, analog LiAlH₄).\n    *   LiAlH₄ is known for its extremely violent reaction with water. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   This reaction produces a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide (**G = Al(OD)₃**), which we already established fits the description.\n    *   The reaction of NaBD₄ produces soluble sodium salts (NaOD, NaBO₂), not a precipitate.\n    *   Thus, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n6.  **\"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.\n    *   LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄) is a powerful reducing agent. It reduces ketones to secondary alcohols (-CH(OH)-) and carboxylic acids to primary alcohols (-CH₂OH).\n    *   Therefore, the reaction on a keto acid produces a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains 2 oxygen atoms. This final clue confirms the identity of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Final Value**\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄):** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n\n2.  **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:** This is determined by the atomic number (Z).\n    *   H (D): Z = 1 --> **Lightest element**\n    *   Li: Z = 3\n    *   Al: Z = 13 --> **Heaviest element**\n\n3.  **Interpret the calculation instruction:** \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   This means we need to find the total mass contribution from all atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen) and add it to the total mass contribution from all atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminum) in one molecule of LiAlD₄.\n    *   We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes, as suggested by the integer options provided.\n        *   Mass number of Deuterium (D) = 2.\n        *   Mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminum (²⁷Al) = 27.\n\n4.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium.\n        *   Cumulative mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Aluminum.\n        *   Cumulative mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Sum of these cumulative masses = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
