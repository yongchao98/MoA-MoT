    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent group on each benzene ring (C6H5-). Substituents determine the position (ortho, meta, or para) where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will attach. They are classified as either activating (ortho, para-directing) or deactivating (meta-directing, with halogens as an exception).\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**: -CH3 (methyl) is an alkyl group. It's an electron-donating group (activating) and therefore directs to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)**: -COOC2H5 (ester) has a carbonyl group attached to the ring. It is a moderately strong electron-withdrawing group (deactivating) and directs to the *meta* position.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**: -Cl (chloro) is a halogen. Halogens are deactivating due to their strong inductive electron withdrawal, but they are *ortho, para*-directing due to resonance.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**: -NO2 (nitro) is a very strong electron-withdrawing group (strongly deactivating) and directs to the *meta* position.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**: -C2H5 (ethyl) is an alkyl group, similar to methyl. It is an activating group and directs to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)**: -COOH (carboxyl) has a carbonyl group attached to the ring. It is an electron-withdrawing group (deactivating) and directs to the *meta* position.\n\n**Step 2: Group the substances by directing effect.**\nBased on the classification, we can form two groups:\n*   **Meta-directors**: These will produce a very small amount of the para-isomer. This group includes:\n    *   4) C6H5-NO2\n    *   6) C6H5-COOH\n    *   2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n*   **Ortho, para-directors**: These will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer. This group includes:\n    *   1) ะก6H5-CH3\n    *   5) C6H5-C2H5\n    *   3) C6H5-Cl\n\nSince meta-directors give very low yields of the para product, all substances in the meta-directing group will come before the substances in the ortho, para-directing group in the final ranking.\n\n**Step 3: Rank the meta-directors (4, 6, 2).**\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect. The stronger the deactivating group, the more exclusively it directs to the meta position, resulting in a lower yield of the ortho and para isomers. The order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro > Carboxyl > Ester)\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order:\n-NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5\nThis corresponds to the substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n(Typical para yields: NO2 ~0.3-1%, COOH ~2%, COOC2H5 ~4-6%)\n\n**Step 4: Rank the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3).**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is mainly influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5)**: The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulkiness hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions more effectively, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered *para* position. Therefore, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Yield(para-isomer): **1 < 5**\n    *   (Typical para yields: Toluene ~62-67%, Ethylbenzene ~71%)\n\n*   **Comparing alkyl groups (1, 5) with -Cl (3)**: The chloro group is a special case. While it deactivates the ring, it strongly favors the para position for substitution. This is due to a combination of its steric size and its powerful inductive effect, which deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the more distant para position. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a very high proportion of the para-isomer, higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Yield(para-isomer): **1 < 5 < 3**\n    *   (Typical para yield for Chlorobenzene ~87%)\n\n**Step 5: Combine the rankings.**\nNow, we combine the two ranked groups. The group of meta-directors has significantly lower para yields than the group of ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-director ranking: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho, para-director ranking: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
