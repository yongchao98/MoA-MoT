    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the given operators.**\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ as:\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    These are the spin angular momentum operators for a spin-1/2 particle, where the matrices are the Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$.\n\n2.  **Define the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.**\n    The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector lying in the x-z plane. We can parameterize this vector using the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the positive z-axis. In spherical coordinates, a general unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$. For a vector in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, which means we can set the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$.\n    So, the direction vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the operator $P_n$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$.**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y (0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\sin\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) + \\cos\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    Factoring out $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the eigenvalue equation.**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n    The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the eigenvector components.**\n    We can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's solve for the ratio of $b$ to $a$ using the first equation:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    Using the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n    So,\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    This means the components of the eigenvector are in the ratio $b/a = \\tan(\\theta/2)$. We can write the unnormalized eigenvector by choosing a convenient value for $a$. Let $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$. Then $b = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n    So, the eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some normalization constant $C$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the eigenvector.**\n    The normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$. The squared norm of our vector is:\n    $|\\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |\\sin(\\theta/2)|^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n    The vector is already normalized, so we can take the normalization constant $C=1$.\n    The normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n7.  **Identify the elements and compare with the options.**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect. Contains $\\hbar$ and is not a function of $\\theta$.\n    B) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect. The angles should be $\\theta/2$.\n    C) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect. Contains $\\hbar$ and incorrect coefficients.\n    D) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Correct. This matches our derived result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
