    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Conclusion: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent but does not differentiate between them.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   \"No peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\": This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is also consistent.\n    *   The crucial information lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicities) of two specific signals:\n        *   Signal 1: A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n        *   Signal 2: A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n3.  **Understanding Complex Splitting:**\n    *   A proton's signal is split by its non-equivalent neighboring protons according to the `n+1` rule.\n    *   When a proton is coupled to multiple *different* sets of neighboring protons, its signal becomes a multiplet of multiplets.\n    *   A **dtq** signal means the proton is coupled to three different neighboring groups: one proton (giving the doublet, d), a group of two protons (giving the triplet, t), and a group of three protons (giving the quartet, q).\n    *   A **dtt** signal means the proton is coupled to three different neighboring groups: one proton (d), a group of two protons (t), and another, different group of two protons (t).\n    *   Such complex splitting typically arises from protons on chiral centers (methine, or CH, protons) in an acyclic chain.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Option's Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n    *   **C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        *   `CH3-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-CH2-COOH`\n        *   The methine (CH) proton at C3 is coupled to the CH proton at C4 (1H, gives a doublet) and the CH2 protons at C2 (2H, gives a triplet). Its signal would be a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n        *   The methine (CH) proton at C4 is coupled to the CH at C3 (1H, gives a doublet) and two different CH3 groups (6H total, giving a septet). Its signal would be a **doublet of septets**.\n        *   This molecule does not produce `dtq` and `dtt` signals. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        *   `CH3-CH2-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-COOH`\n        *   The methine proton at C2 is coupled to the methine at C3 (1H, gives a doublet) and its adjacent CH3 group (3H, gives a quartet). Its signal is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   The methine proton at C3 is coupled to the methine at C2 (1H, gives a doublet) and the CH2 of the ethyl group (2H, gives a triplet). Its signal is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n        *   This molecule does not produce `dtq` and `dtt` signals. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n        *   `CH3CH2-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-COOH`\n        *   The methine proton at C2 is coupled to the methine at C3 (1H, gives a doublet) and the CH2 of its ethyl group (2H, gives a triplet). Its signal is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n        *   The methine proton at C3 is coupled to the methine at C2 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH2 of the terminal ethyl group at C4 (2H, gives a triplet), and the CH2 of its own ethyl group (2H, gives another triplet). Its signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n        *   This molecule produces a `dtt` signal, but the other required signal is a `dt`, not a `dtq`. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n        *   The most plausible structure for this condensed formula is `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`.\n        *   Let's analyze its methine protons:\n            *   **Methine proton at C3**: This proton is bonded to C3. Its neighbors are:\n                1.  The methine proton at C4 (1H neighbor, gives a **doublet**).\n                2.  The CH₂ protons at C2 (2H neighbors, give a **triplet**).\n                3.  The CH₂ protons of the ethyl group on C3 (2H neighbors, give another **triplet**).\n                *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the given signals.\n            *   **Methine proton at C4**: This proton is bonded to C4. Its neighbors are:\n                1.  The methine proton at C3 (1H neighbor, gives a **doublet**).\n                2.  The CH₂ protons of the ethyl group on C4 (2H neighbors, give a **triplet**).\n                3.  The terminal CH₃ protons at C5 (3H neighbors, give a **quartet**).\n                *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other given signal.\n        *   This molecule produces both a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal. **Option A is correct.**\n\nFinal Conclusion: By systematically analyzing the predicted 1H NMR splitting patterns for each of the four possible structures, only structure A (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid) produces signals that match the experimental data (`dtt` and `dtq`).\n\n<<<A>>>"
