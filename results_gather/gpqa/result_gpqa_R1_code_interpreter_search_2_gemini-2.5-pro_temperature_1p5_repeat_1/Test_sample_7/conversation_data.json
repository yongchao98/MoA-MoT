    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n**1. Analyze the Role of Gene G2**\n\n*   **g2 single mutant:** The resistance drops to 0%. This is the most severe phenotype possible, indicating that G2 is absolutely essential for any level of pathogen resistance.\n*   **g1g2 and g2g3 double mutants:** Both of these double mutants also show 0% resistance.\n*   **Conclusion on G2:** When the phenotype of a double mutant (e.g., `g1g2`) is identical to the phenotype of one of the single mutants (`g2`), it demonstrates **epistasis**. In this case, the `g2` mutation is epistatic to both `g1` and `g3` because its effect (complete loss of resistance) masks the effects of the `g1` and `g3` mutations. The question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. A master transcription factor that activates the entire resistance pathway would, when knocked out, cause a complete loss of function, making it epistatic to all downstream genes. Therefore, G2 is the most likely candidate for this master transcription factor.\n\n**2. Analyze the Interaction between Genes G1 and G3**\n\n*   **g1 single mutant:** Results in a 25% loss of resistance (100% -> 75%).\n*   **g3 single mutant:** Results in a 50% loss of resistance (100% -> 50%).\n*   **Expected additive effect:** If the genes acted in completely separate, independent pathways, the expected loss of resistance in the double mutant would be the sum of the individual losses: 25% + 50% = 75%. The expected remaining resistance would be 100% - 75% = 25%.\n*   **Actual g1g3 double mutant:** The observed resistance is 10%, meaning a 90% loss.\n*   **Conclusion on G1 and G3:** The observed loss of function (90%) is much greater than the expected additive loss (75%). This type of genetic interaction, where the double mutant shows a much more severe phenotype than the sum of the single mutants, is called **synergism** or **synthetic enhancement**. It is a hallmark of **gene redundancy**, where two genes perform similar or parallel functions. The organism can cope with the loss of one gene, but losing both is catastrophic. Therefore, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Statement on Epistasis between G1 and G3**\n\n*   Classical epistasis requires that one mutation masks the phenotype of another. The `g1g3` double mutant has a phenotype (10% resistance) that is different from both the `g1` mutant (75%) and the `g3` mutant (50%). Therefore, neither G1 nor G3 is classically epistatic to the other.\n*   However, we must evaluate the options provided based on the strongest evidence.\n\n**4. Assess the Final Options**\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Strongly supported by the epistasis data.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": Strongly supported by the synergistic effect in the `g1g3` mutant.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": Not supported by the data. However, the first two conclusions are very strong.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n    *   The term **pleiotropy** means one gene affects multiple traits. This experiment only measures one trait (disease resistance), so we cannot make any conclusion about pleiotropy. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:**\n    *   We cannot determine if G1 and G3 share a promoter from this phenotypic data. This is a molecular detail that requires other types of experiments. This option introduces an unsupported assumption.\n\n*   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:**\n    *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\": This contradicts the data. The `g2` mutant, not the `g1` mutant, has the most severe phenotype and shows epistasis over the others.\n    *   \"pleiotropy\": This is an unsupported conclusion. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nOption A contains two conclusions (\"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\") that are strongly and directly supported by the experimental results. The third clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is not supported, but the other options contain definitive falsehoods (claims of pleiotropy) or unsubstantiated assumptions (shared promoter) or incorrectly identify the main regulatory gene. Therefore, Option A is the best and most comprehensive conclusion that can be drawn from the experiment.\n\n<<<A>>>"
