    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame, which is considered stationary.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference that is moving along with the glass.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   **v:** This is the velocity of the glass (the S' frame) as measured by the observer in the laboratory (the S frame). The problem states the glass is moving at velocity `v` in the same direction as the beam. We'll take this direction as positive.\n    *   **u':** This is the velocity of the light beam as measured within its own medium, the glass (the S' frame). The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`. The beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass is moving, so `u'` is also positive.\n    *   **u:** This is the velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (the S frame). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Principle:**\n    This problem involves adding velocities in a relativistic context. The classical Galilean addition of velocities (u = u' + v) is not correct at speeds approaching the speed of light. We must use Einstein's relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities `u'` and `v` that are in the same direction is:\n    \n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We substitute the values from step 2 into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    The formula becomes:\n    \n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Now, we simplify the algebraic expression:\n    \n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    \n    `u = [ n * (1/n + v) ] / [ n * (1 + v/n) ]`\n    \n    Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    \n    `u = ( n*(1/n) + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*(v/n) )`\n    \n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived speed `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option B.\n\n    A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) 1\n    D) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
