    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze Planet (a): An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    This is essentially a planet with the same properties as Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. This serves as our baseline for comparison.\n    *   Density (ρ_a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n\n2.  **Analyze Planet (b): A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.**\n    The density is given directly in the problem statement.\n    *   Density (ρ_b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    This is almost identical to Earth's density.\n\n3.  **Analyze Planet (c): A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    This planet has the same building blocks as Earth (e.g., iron, silicate rock) but is much more massive. The increased mass leads to a much stronger gravitational force. This immense gravity compresses the planet's material, forcing the atoms closer together. This gravitational compression results in a significantly higher overall density compared to a less massive planet of the same composition.\n    *   Density (ρ_c) > Density of Earth (ρ_a).\n\n4.  **Analyze Planet (d): A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    This planet is less massive than Earth. Following the same logic as for planet (c), its weaker gravity results in less compression of its materials. Therefore, its average density will be lower than Earth's.\n    *   Density (ρ_d) < Density of Earth (ρ_a).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy comparing the densities:\n*   ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   ρ_b ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n*   ρ_c is significantly > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to gravitational compression).\n*   ρ_d is < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to less gravitational compression).\n\nThe planet with 5 times the mass of Earth (c) will be compressed the most by its own gravity, leading to the highest density.\n\n<<<B>>>"
