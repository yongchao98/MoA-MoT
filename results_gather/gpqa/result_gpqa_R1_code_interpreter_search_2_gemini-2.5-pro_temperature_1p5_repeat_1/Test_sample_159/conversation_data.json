    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Limiting Case of the Aperture Shape:**\n    The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where the apothem (the distance from the center to the midpoint of any side) is a constant value 'a'. We are asked to consider the case where N becomes infinitely large (N -> ∞).\n\n    *   For a regular N-sided polygon, the distance from the center to each side is the apothem 'a'.\n    *   As N increases, the number of sides increases, and the length of each side decreases.\n    *   In the limit as N -> ∞, the polygon becomes a smooth curve where the distance from the center to any point on the curve is constant. This shape is a circle.\n    *   The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of the resulting circle.\n    *   Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a **circular aperture of radius 'a'**.\n\n2.  **Recall the Theory of Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:**\n    When monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a characteristic diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n    *   The intensity distribution I(θ) in the far-field region is described by the square of a Bessel function:\n        I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²\n        where:\n        *   `I₀` is the central intensity maximum.\n        *   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n        *   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n        *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n        *   `θ` is the angular position measured from the central axis.\n\n3.  **Determine the Angular Positions of the Minima:**\n    The intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, provided the denominator is not also zero. This means we need to find the values of `θ` for which `J₁(k * a * sinθ) = 0`.\n\n    *   The minima correspond to the non-zero roots of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. Let's denote these roots as `j₁,m` where `m = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n    *   The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n        `k * a * sin(θₘ) = j₁,m`\n    *   Substituting `k = 2π / λ` and using the small-angle approximation `sin(θₘ) ≈ θₘ` (as given in the problem), we get:\n        `(2π / λ) * a * θₘ = j₁,m`\n    *   Solving for the angular position `θₘ`:\n        `θₘ = (j₁,m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n4.  **Find the Zeros of the Bessel Function and Calculate the Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    We need the values for the first two non-zero roots of `J₁(x)`. These are standard mathematical constants.\n    *   First zero, `j₁,₁` ≈ 3.8317\n    *   Second zero, `j₁,₂` ≈ 7.0156\n\n    Now, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n    *   **First minimum (m=1):**\n        `θ₁ = (j₁,₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) = (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n    *   **Second minimum (m=2):**\n        `θ₂ = (j₁,₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) = (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima:**\n    The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n    *   `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1166 * λ/a) - (0.6098 * λ/a)`\n    *   `Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ/a)`\n    *   `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ/a)`\n\n    To get a more precise value, we can use a small python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Zeros of the J1 Bessel function\nj1_first_zero = 3.8317\nj1_second_zero = 7.0156\n\n# The formula for the angular position of the m-th minimum is:\n# theta_m = (j1_m_zero / (2 * pi)) * (lambda / a)\n# We need to find the coefficient for the angular distance.\n# coefficient = (j1_second_zero - j1_first_zero) / (2 * pi)\n\ncoefficient = (j1_second_zero - j1_first_zero) / (2 * math.pi)\nprint(coefficient)\n```\n\n6.  **Analyze the Result and Select the Correct Option:**\n    The calculation yields a coefficient of approximately 0.5067.\n    \n    `Δθ ≈ 0.507 * (λ/a)`\n\n    Let's compare this with the given options:\n    A) 0.610 λ / a  (This corresponds to the position of the *first* minimum, `θ₁`, not the distance between minima.)\n    B) 0.506 λ / a  (This value matches our calculated result very closely.)\n    C) 1.220 λ /a  (This is related to the Rayleigh criterion using the diameter `D=2a`, but it represents `2θ₁`, the angular diameter of the central Airy disk, not the spacing between minima.)\n    D) 0.500 λ / a  (This is the result for a single slit of width `d=2a`, not a circular aperture.)\n\nThe correct answer is the one that matches our calculation for the angular distance between the first and second minima.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` approaches a circle of radius `a` as the number of sides N approaches infinity. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture is given by the Airy pattern. The angular positions of the dark fringes (minima) are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, `J₁(x)`.\n\nThe condition for the m-th intensity minimum is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θₘ) = j₁,m`\nwhere:\n*   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `θₘ` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `j₁,m` is the m-th zero of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`, the equation becomes:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θₘ = j₁,m`\n\nSolving for `θₘ`:\n`θₘ = (j₁,m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nWe need the first two non-zero roots of `J₁(x)` to find the positions of the first two minima:\n*   First zero (`m=1`): `j₁,₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero (`m=2`): `j₁,₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions of the first two minima:\n*   Angular position of the first minimum (`θ₁`):\n    `θ₁ = (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n*   Angular position of the second minimum (`θ₂`):\n    `θ₂ = (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(j₁,₂ - j₁,₁) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = [(7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = [3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159)] * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\nThis value is approximately `0.506 * (λ / a)`. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 0.610 λ / a  (This is the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`)\nB) 0.506 λ / a  (This matches our calculated distance)\nC) 1.220 λ /a  (This is twice the position of the first minimum, `2θ₁`, which represents the angular diameter of the central Airy disk)\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe calculated angular distance matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
