    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. A common form is **keto-enol tautomerism**, which requires the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen**â€”a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group. The alpha-carbon must be sp3-hybridized to allow for this hydrogen migration.\n\n    1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone or cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione):**\n        *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups (C=O) at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) at positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n        *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are C2, C3, C5, and C6.\n        *   **Hybridization:** These alpha-carbons are part of the C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp2-hybridized.\n        *   **Conclusion:** For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, a proton must be removed from an alpha-carbon. In benzoquinone, the alpha-carbons are sp2 hybridized, and they lack the necessary sp3-hybridized alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   **Structure:** It is a saturated six-membered ring with three ketone groups (C=O) at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Each of these is a -CH2- group.\n        *   **Hybridization:** These alpha-carbons are sp3-hybridized and each carries two hydrogen atoms (alpha-hydrogens). These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens on sp3-hybridized carbons, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerism**. In fact, its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is aromatic and thus the more stable tautomer.\n\n    *   Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n        *   **Chiral Center Analysis:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is the one bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n            *   Group 1: -H (Hydrogen)\n            *   Group 2: -OH (Hydroxyl group)\n            *   Group 3: -CH3 (Methyl group)\n            *   Group 4: -COOCH3 (Methyl ester group)\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since C2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. Thus, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism**.\n\n    2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of the dimethyl ester of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n        *   **Chiral Center Analysis:** The molecule has no sp3-hybridized carbon bonded to four different groups. The carbons in the double bond are sp2-hybridized.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Final Summary**\n    *   The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone (A)**.\n    *   The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (B)**.\n\n    Matching these findings with the options provided:\n    *   A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
