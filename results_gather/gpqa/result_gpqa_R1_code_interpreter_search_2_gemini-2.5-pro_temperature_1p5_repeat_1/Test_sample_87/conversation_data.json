    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on a described experiment.\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup:**\n    *   **Antigen:** GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage, meaning the antigen is introduced into the gastrointestinal tract.\n    *   **Observation Location:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs located in the small intestine. This is a key site for initiating immune responses to gut antigens.\n    *   **Cell Population:** A *proliferating* cell population is isolated from the Peyer's patches. Proliferation (clonal expansion) is a hallmark of an adaptive immune response after lymphocytes encounter their specific antigen.\n    *   **Genetic Analysis:** The *variable heavy chain gene* of these proliferating cells is sequenced.\n    *   **Key Finding:** \"High variability\" is observed in this gene region.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options in the context of the experiment:**\n\n    *   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors (antibodies) and T cell receptors. It occurs in primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells, thymus for T cells) *before* the lymphocyte encounters an antigen. The experiment is observing a process in a *secondary* lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure in a proliferating population. While VDJ recombination creates variability, it's not the process occurring at this stage.\n\n    *   **B) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, a cascade of plasma proteins that helps clear pathogens. It does not involve any genetic changes to lymphocytes like B cells and therefore cannot explain the variability in the heavy chain gene.\n\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). Following antigen recognition and T-cell help, B cells proliferate rapidly. During this proliferation, the genes encoding the variable regions of the antibodies (both heavy and light chains) undergo mutation at an extremely high rate. This creates a population of B cells with slightly different antibodies. Those B cells whose mutations lead to a higher affinity for the antigen are then selected to survive and differentiate. This process directly results in \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" within a \"proliferating cell population\" in a \"Peyer's patch\" after antigen stimulation. This matches the experimental findings perfectly.\n\n    *   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the *variable* region. This switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is common in mucosal responses) and alters the antibody's effector function, but it does not change its antigen-binding specificity or create variability in the variable region itself. The question specifically states variability in the *variable heavy chain gene*.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating B cell population in a Peyer's patch after antigen encounter is the defining characteristic of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
