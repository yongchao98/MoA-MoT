    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:** The given potential is in 2D polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation, it is often easiest if the potential is separable. Let's test if it's separable in Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:** We use the standard transformation equations:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    From these, we can see that `r^2 cos^2(θ) = (r cos(θ))^2 = x^2`.\n    Now, substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k (x^2)\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:** Combine the terms with x^2 and y^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2) kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n4.  **Recognize the Separable Form:** The potential is now in the form V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), where:\n    *   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n    *   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\n    This is the potential for a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be separated into two independent 1D harmonic oscillator equations, one for the x-coordinate and one for the y-coordinate. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from each dimension: E = E_x + E_y.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Energy in the x-direction (E_x):**\n    The potential for a 1D harmonic oscillator is generally written as V(z) = 1/2 mω^2 z^2, and its energy eigenvalues are E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.\n    For the x-direction, we have V_x(x) = 2kx^2. We can write this as V_x(x) = 1/2 (4k) x^2.\n    Comparing this to the general form V_x(x) = 1/2 mω_x^2 x^2, we identify `mω_x^2 = 4k`.\n    Solving for the angular frequency ω_x:\n    ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n    ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n    The energy levels for the x-oscillator are given by:\n    E_nx = (n_x + 1/2) ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n6.  **Solve for the Energy in the y-direction (E_y):**\n    For the y-direction, we have V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2.\n    Comparing this to the general form V_y(y) = 1/2 mω_y^2 y^2, we identify `mω_y^2 = k`.\n    Solving for the angular frequency ω_y:\n    ω_y^2 = k/m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n    The energy levels for the y-oscillator are given by:\n    E_ny = (n_y + 1/2) ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum (E):**\n    The total energy is the sum of the energies for the independent oscillators:\n    E = E_x + E_y\n    E = (n_x + 1/2) ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    Factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    Distribute the 2 in the first term:\n    E = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    Combine the constant terms:\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n8.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m).\n    This matches option C.\n\n    A) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    D) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
