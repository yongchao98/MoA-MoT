    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl / R_star`) that would cause the same brightness drop as the rotational modulation of a star with spots on one hemisphere.\n\n2.  **Model the Star's Brightness Variation:**\n    *   The star's brightness varies because it rotates, showing a more spotted side and a less spotted side to the observer.\n    *   The maximum brightness (or flux, `F_max`) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is fully facing the observer. The entire visible disk of the star is considered to be at the effective temperature, `T_eff`.\n    *   The minimum brightness (`F_min`) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is fully facing the observer. This hemisphere has a fraction `f` (the filling factor) of its area covered by cooler spots (`T_spot`) and the rest `(1-f)` is at the normal effective temperature (`T_eff`).\n\n3.  **Use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The flux emitted by a blackbody per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (`F ∝ T^4`).\n    *   Flux from the unspotted photosphere: `F_phot ∝ T_eff^4`\n    *   Flux from the dark spots: `F_spot ∝ T_spot^4`\n\n4.  **Formulate Expressions for Maximum and Minimum Flux:**\n    *   When the unspotted hemisphere faces us, the entire visible disk has a flux proportional to `T_eff^4`. So, `F_max ∝ T_eff^4`.\n    *   When the spotted hemisphere faces us, a fraction `f` of the disk area is covered by spots. The total flux is a weighted average of the flux from the spotted and unspotted areas. So, `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Stellar Variation:** The amplitude of the signal is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum brightness states.\n    *   `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    *   Substituting the expressions from step 4 (the proportionality constants cancel out):\n        `Amplitude = (T_eff^4 - [(1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4]) / T_eff^4`\n    *   Simplifying the numerator:\n        `Amplitude = (T_eff^4 - T_eff^4 + f * T_eff^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_eff^4`\n        `Amplitude = (f * T_eff^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_eff^4`\n    *   Factoring out `f` and simplifying further:\n        `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`\n\n6.  **Relate Stellar Variation to Exoplanet Transit:** An exoplanet transit causes a dip in brightness (the transit depth) equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   `Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)`\n    *   `Transit Depth = (π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2) = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n\n7.  **Equate the Two Effects and Solve:** The problem states that the amplitude of the stellar variation is the same as the transit depth.\n    *   `Amplitude = Transit Depth`\n    *   `f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4) = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n    *   Solving for the relative radius `(R_pl / R_star)`:\n        `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4))`\n\n8.  **Plug in the Given Values and Calculate:**\n    *   Filling factor, `f = 20% = 0.20`\n    *   Effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`\n    *   Spot temperature, `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n    *   We can use a Python script to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the parameters from the problem description\nf = 0.20         # Filling factor of spots\nT_eff = 6000.0   # Effective temperature of the star (K)\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Temperature of the spots (K)\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots\n# Formula: Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)\namplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The amplitude of the spot signal is equal to the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet\n# Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)^2\n# Therefore, we can set amplitude = (R_pl / R_star)^2 and solve for (R_pl / R_star)\nrpl_rstar_ratio = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(rpl_rstar_ratio)\n```",
    "The code calculated the value of `R_pl / R_star` to be approximately 0.3218.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the temperature ratio:**\n    `T_spot / T_eff = 5000 / 6000 = 5/6`\n\n2.  **Raise the ratio to the fourth power:**\n    `(5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225`\n\n3.  **Calculate the term in the parenthesis:**\n    `1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4 = 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775`\n\n4.  **Multiply by the filling factor:**\n    `f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4) = 0.20 * 0.51775 = 0.10355`\n    This value represents the amplitude of the brightness variation, which is also the transit depth `(R_pl / R_star)^2`.\n\n5.  **Take the square root to find the relative radius:**\n    `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.32179`\n\nThis result matches the code output. Comparing this value to the given options:\n\n*   A) ~0.11\n*   B) ~0.39\n*   C) ~0.32\n*   D) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
