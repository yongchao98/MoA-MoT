    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) - (0/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C) or ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** The chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates that it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a -CH2- group), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks). This establishes a **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the two protons of the -CH2- group inferred above. The splitting is a doublet (d), which confirms it is coupled to a single proton (the aldehyde proton), as n+1 = 1+1=2 peaks. This confirms the **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as doublets, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for two protons in this region is typical for a primary amine group (**-NH2**).\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n    We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group. The only way to assemble these fragments to satisfy the molecular formula C8H9NO is to attach the -NH2 group and the -CH2CHO group at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring.\n\n    The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    1.  **Diazotization:** The primary amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (HONO, formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water (H2O), typically with gentle warming, to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n\n    So, the -NH2 group is converted to an -OH group. The intermediate product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Structure: `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO`\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves reacting the intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat. The intermediate is an aldehyde that possesses acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- protons).\n    These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**. The reaction involves two key stages:\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** One molecule of the aldehyde forms an enolate, which acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n    2.  **Dehydration:** Because the reaction is heated, the initially formed β-hydroxy aldehyde readily eliminates a molecule of water to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n    Let's trace the mechanism:\n    *   **Addition Product:** Two molecules of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde react to form **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C), but this is not the final product under heating conditions.\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation Product):** The addition product loses water. The hydroxyl group on C3 and the acidic proton on C2 are eliminated, forming a double bond between C2 and C3.\n\n        `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4-OH)-CHO  --[Heat, OH-]-> (HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(C6H4-OH)-CHO + H2O`\n\n    The final product is named as follows:\n    *   Parent chain: A 4-carbon chain with an aldehyde and a C=C double bond -> butenal.\n    *   Numbering starts from the aldehyde carbon (C1). The double bond is between C2 and C3 -> but-2-enal.\n    *   Substituents: A (4-hydroxyphenyl) group on C2 and a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group on C4.\n    *   Final name: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis structure matches option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
