    "Here is my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I first need to understand what information is given and what the question is asking for.\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Two star-planet systems (System 1 and System 2).\n        *   Star masses are equal: `M_star1 = M_star2` (and are Sun-like).\n        *   Planet masses are equal: `M_p1 = M_p2` (and are Neptune-like).\n        *   Orbits are circular.\n        *   The detection method is the Radial Velocity (RV) method.\n        *   Maximum wavelength shift for System 1 (`Δλ₁`) = 5 mÅ.\n        *   Maximum wavelength shift for System 2 (`Δλ₂`) = 7 mÅ.\n    *   **To Find:**\n        *   The ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is `T₂ / T₁`.\n\n2.  **Relate Observables to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The RV method measures the Doppler shift of a star's light. The wavelength shift `Δλ` is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity `v_r`.\n    *   The maximum observed wavelength shift (`Δλ_max`) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the RV semi-amplitude, `K`.\n    *   The relationship is `K ∝ Δλ_max`.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum wavelength shifts:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n3.  **Find the Physics Connecting `K` and `T`:** I need to find a formula that connects the star's velocity amplitude (`K`) to the planet's orbital period (`T`).\n    *   For a circular orbit viewed edge-on (an assumption we must make as inclination `i` is not given, so we assume `sin(i)` is constant for both systems), the star's orbital speed is `K`.\n    *   The star's orbital speed is `K = 2π * a_star / T`, where `a_star` is the radius of the star's own small orbit around the system's center of mass.\n    *   The center of mass relation is `M_star * a_star = M_p * a_p`, where `a = a_star + a_p` is the planet's orbital radius. From this, we get `a_star = a * (M_p / (M_star + M_p))`.\n    *   Since a Neptune-like planet is much less massive than a Sun-like star (`M_p << M_star`), we can approximate `M_star + M_p ≈ M_star`.\n    *   So, `a_star ≈ a * (M_p / M_star)`.\n    *   Substituting this into the equation for `K`: `K ≈ (2π / T) * (a * M_p / M_star)`. This equation has `a`, `T`, and `K`. We need to eliminate `a`.\n\n4.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates the orbital period `T` to the orbital radius `a`.\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states: `T² / a³ = 4π² / (G * (M_star + M_p))`.\n    *   Again, using the approximation `M_star + M_p ≈ M_star`, we get `T² / a³ ≈ 4π² / (G * M_star)`.\n    *   I need to solve this for `a` to substitute it into my expression for `K`:\n        `a³ ≈ G * M_star * T² / (4π²) `\n        `a ≈ (G * M_star / (4π²))^(1/3) * T^(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations and Find the Proportionality:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for `a` into the expression for `K`:\n        `K ≈ (2π * M_p / (M_star * T)) * [ (G * M_star / (4π²))^(1/3) * T^(2/3) ]`\n    *   Now, I'll group the terms. The variables are `K` and `T`. Everything else (`M_p`, `M_star`, `G`, `π`) is constant for both systems.\n        `K ∝ (1/T) * T^(2/3)`\n        `K ∝ T^(2/3 - 1)`\n        `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`\n    *   This is the key relationship: the RV semi-amplitude `K` is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period `T`.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Ratio `T₂ / T₁`:**\n    *   From the proportionality `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`, I can write a ratio:\n        `K₂ / K₁ = (T₂)^(-1/3) / (T₁)^(-1/3) = (T₂ / T₁) ^(-1/3) = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n    *   I want to find `T₂ / T₁`. Let's rearrange the equation:\n        `T₁ / T₂ = (K₂ / K₁)³`\n        `T₂ / T₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³`\n    *   Now I can substitute the values. I know from step 2 that `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n        `T₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   I need to compute `(5/7)³`.\n    *   `(5/7)³ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343`.\n    *   To get the decimal value, I will use a calculator. This is a good place to use the code interpreter for precision.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio (5/7)^3\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.3644. Looking at the options:\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 1.96\n\nThe result `0.3644` is very close to `0.36`.\n\n8.  **Final check:** A larger wavelength shift (`Δλ₂ > Δλ₁`) means a larger stellar velocity (`K₂ > K₁`). A faster-moving star (for the same masses) implies the planet is in a closer, tighter orbit, which means a shorter orbital period (`T₂ < T₁`). Therefore, the ratio `T₂ / T₁` must be less than 1. My result of ~0.36 is less than 1, so the answer is physically sensible.\n\nThe reasoning is sound, and the calculation confirms option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the observed wavelength shift (`Δλ`), which is proportional to the star's radial velocity amplitude (`K`), and the planet's orbital period (`T`).\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:**\n    The radial velocity method relies on the Doppler effect. The maximum shift in wavelength, `Δλ`, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, `K`.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the stellar velocities is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 mÅ / 7 mÅ = 5/7`\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (`K`) to Orbital Period (`T`):**\n    For a circular orbit (viewed edge-on), the star's orbital speed `K` is given by:\n    `K = (M_p / M_star) * v_p`\n    where `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `v_p` is the planet's orbital speed.\n\n    The planet's orbital speed `v_p` is the circumference of its orbit divided by its period:\n    `v_p = 2πa / T`\n    where `a` is the orbital radius (semi-major axis).\n\n    Substituting `v_p` into the equation for `K`:\n    `K = (M_p / M_star) * (2πa / T)`\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period `T` to the orbital radius `a`:\n    `T² ∝ a³` or `a ∝ T^(2/3)` (assuming `M_star + M_p ≈ M_star`, which is a safe assumption here).\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Now substitute the proportionality for `a` into the equation for `K`:\n    `K ∝ (1 / T) * a`\n    `K ∝ (1 / T) * T^(2/3)`\n    `K ∝ T^(2/3 - 1)`\n    `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`\n\n    This is the key relationship: the star's velocity amplitude `K` is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period `T`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Periods:**\n    From the proportionality `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`, we can write a ratio:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (T₁)^(-1/3) / (T₂)^(-1/3) = (T₂ / T₁)^(1/3)`\n\n    We want to find the ratio `T₂ / T₁`. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    `T₂ / T₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³`\n\n    Now, we substitute the known ratio of the velocities:\n    `T₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    `T₂ / T₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343`\n\n    Calculating the decimal value:\n    `125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
