    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In a conservative system, the total energy is constant. For a relativistic particle moving in a potential field, the total energy of the system is the sum of the particle's kinetic energy and the potential energy.\n\n2.  **Define the energies involved.**\n    *   **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (K):** The kinetic energy of a particle of rest mass $m$ moving with speed $v$ is given by $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   **Potential Energy (U):** The oscillator obeys Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy stored in the spring is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\n3.  **Formulate the total conserved energy.**\n    The total conserved energy $E_{total}$ of the system is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies:\n    $E_{total} = K + U = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    This total energy must remain constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n4.  **Analyze the energy at two extreme points of the motion.**\n    We can equate the total energy at two specific points in the particle's path: the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude) and the equilibrium position.\n\n    *   **At the maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n        The particle is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2}} = 1$.\n        The kinetic energy is $K = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\n        The potential energy is maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        So, the total energy at this point is $E_{total} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n        The particle has its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}}$.\n        The kinetic energy is maximum: $K_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n        The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        So, the total energy at this point is $E_{total} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n5.  **Apply energy conservation.**\n    By the principle of energy conservation, the total energy at both points must be the same:\n    Energy at x = A = Energy at x = 0\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n6.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.**\n    First, rearrange the equation to solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first take the reciprocal of both sides (or rearrange):\n    $\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Next, square both sides of the equation:\n    $1 - (\\frac{v_{max}}{c})^2 = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Rearrange to isolate $(\\frac{v_{max}}{c})^2$:\n    $(\\frac{v_{max}}{c})^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, take the square root and multiply by $c$ to get $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    This derived expression exactly matches option C.\n\nLet's also briefly consider the non-relativistic limit ($c \\to \\infty$). In this case, the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$ is very small. Using the binomial approximation $(1+x)^n \\approx 1+nx$ for small $x$, we have $(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^{-2} \\approx 1 - 2(\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}) = 1 - \\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}$.\nThen $v_{max}^2 \\approx c^2(1 - (1 - \\frac{kA^2}{mc^2})) = c^2(\\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}) = \\frac{kA^2}{m}$.\nThis gives $v_{max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$, which is the correct classical result (Option D). This confirms that our relativistic formula has the correct classical limit.\n\n<<<C>>>"
