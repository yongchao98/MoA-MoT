    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Physics Principle:** The question is about distinguishing two energy levels. The key information given is their *lifetimes*. In quantum mechanics, a finite lifetime (Δt) of a state leads to an uncertainty or \"spread\" in its energy (ΔE). This relationship is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle is formally written as:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    Where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which in this case is the lifetime of the state (τ).\n    *   ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n    For order-of-magnitude calculations like this, we can use the simpler relation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt  or  ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Identify the Goal:** We need to \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" the two energy levels, E1 and E2. For two energy levels to be resolvable, their energy difference must be larger than their combined energy uncertainties (or at least larger than the bigger of the two uncertainties). A good rule of thumb (similar to the Rayleigh criterion in optics) is that the separation between the peaks must be greater than their widths.\n\n    So, the condition is: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n    Or, at a minimum, the separation must be greater than the larger of the two individual energy widths: |E1 - E2| > max(ΔE1, ΔE2). Let's calculate the individual widths first.\n\n4.  **List the Given Values and Constants:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ1) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ2) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck Constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s (It's crucial to use the value in electron-volt seconds (eV·s) since the options are in eV).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State:**\n\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   This state has the shorter lifetime, so it will have the *larger* energy uncertainty.\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   This state has the longer lifetime, so it will have the *smaller* energy uncertainty.\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n6.  **Apply the Resolution Condition:**\n    The energy separation, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the energy widths. The dominant (larger) width is ΔE1, which is on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV. The sum of the widths is ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV + 0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    Therefore, to be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be significantly greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    |E1 - E2| >> 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (<< 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV) -> Not resolvable.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV   (>> 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV) -> **Clearly resolvable.**\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV   (< 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV) -> Not resolvable.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV   (<< 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV) -> Not resolvable.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Only option B provides an energy separation that is substantially larger than the inherent energy widths of the states, allowing them to be clearly distinguished.\n\nTo be absolutely sure of the calculation, I'll use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nh_bar_eV_s = 6.582119569e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Given lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using the uncertainty principle (Delta_E ~ h_bar / tau)\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eV_s / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eV_s / tau2\n\n# The condition for the energy levels to be clearly resolved is that their energy difference\n# must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths.\n# The larger width dominates the requirement.\nrequired_separation = delta_E1 + delta_E2 # A conservative estimate for the minimum separation\n\nprint(f\"Lifetime 1 (tau1): {tau1:.1e} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy width for state 1 (Delta_E1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Lifetime 2 (tau2): {tau2:.1e} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy width for state 2 (Delta_E2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"The larger energy width is approximately {max(delta_E1, delta_E2):.4e} eV.\")\nprint(f\"The sum of the energy widths is approximately {required_separation:.4e} eV.\")\nprint(\"\\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than this width.\")\nprint(\"Comparing with the options:\")\noptions = {'A': 1e-11, 'B': 1e-4, 'C': 1e-8, 'D': 1e-9}\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > max(delta_E1, delta_E2):\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\")\n\n```\n<execute_output>\nLifetime 1 (tau1): 1.0e-09 s\nEnergy width for state 1 (Delta_E1): 6.5821e-07 eV\n------------------------------\nLifetime 2 (tau2): 1.0e-08 s\nEnergy width for state 2 (Delta_E2): 6.5821e-08 eV\n------------------------------\nThe larger energy width is approximately 6.5821e-07 eV.\nThe sum of the energy widths is approximately 7.2403e-07 eV.\n\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than this width.\nComparing with the options:\nOption A (1.0e-11 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\nOption B (1.0e-04 eV) is a possible energy difference.\nOption C (1.0e-08 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\nOption D (1.0e-09 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\n</execute_output>\n\nThe reasoning and the Python calculation both confirm that the required energy separation must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.

    "The problem requires us to determine a possible energy difference between two quantum states that would allow them to be clearly distinguished, given their lifetimes. The key principle to use here is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relation is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\n2.  **Physical Interpretation:** For a quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ), its energy is not perfectly defined. The lifetime τ can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt). This leads to a \"spread\" or uncertainty in the energy of the state, often called the natural linewidth, given by:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Condition for Resolution:** To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E2 - E1|) must be larger than their energy widths. A common criterion for clear resolution is that the energy separation should be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2). At the very least, the separation must be greater than the larger of the two widths.\n    Condition: |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n4.  **Given Information:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ1) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ2) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n5.  **Calculations:**\n    *   **Calculate the energy width of state 1 (ΔE1):**\n        This state has the shorter lifetime, so it will have the larger energy width.\n        ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **Calculate the energy width of state 2 (ΔE2):**\n        ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n6.  **Apply Resolution Condition:**\n    The required energy separation |E2 - E1| must be greater than the sum of the widths.\n    ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    So, we need an energy difference |E2 - E1| > 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (much smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV   (much larger than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV   (smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV   (much smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference that is significantly larger than the natural energy widths of the states. This large separation ensures that the energy distributions of the two states do not overlap, allowing them to be clearly resolved. The provided code output confirms these calculations.\n\n<<<B>>>"
