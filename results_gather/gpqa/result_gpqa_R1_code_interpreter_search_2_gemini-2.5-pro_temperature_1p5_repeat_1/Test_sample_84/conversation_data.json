    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** I'll write out the equilibrium temperature for each planet and then divide them.\n    *   `T_eq1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)`\n    *   `T_eq2 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)`\n\n    The ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2` is:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** Several terms are common to both planets and will cancel out:\n    *   `T_star` is the same for both.\n    *   `R_star` is the same for both.\n    *   The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, so `A_1 = A_2`.\n\n    After canceling these terms, the equation simplifies significantly:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (1 / a_1) / (1 / a_2) )`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\n    This means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a_2 / a_1`.\n\n5.  **Relate Given Information to the Semi-Major Axis:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method: the Doppler shift `Δλ`.\n    *   The Doppler shift `Δλ` is related to the star's maximum radial velocity `K_star` (also known as the RV semi-amplitude) by the non-relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n        `K_star = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`\n        where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    *   For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity `K_star` is related to the planet's mass `M_p`, the star's mass `M_star`, and the semi-major axis `a`. The formula, assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_p << M_star`), is:\n        `K_star ≈ (M_p * sin(i)) / sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(G / a)`\n        where `G` is the gravitational constant and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n6.  **Handle the Inclination (`i`):** The problem states the planets were detected by *both* transit and RV methods. A transit can only occur if the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, which means the inclination `i` must be very close to 90°. For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`. This is a standard and crucial assumption in problems combining these two detection methods.\n\n7.  **Isolate the Semi-Major Axis (`a`):** With `sin(i) = 1`, the formula becomes:\n    `K_star ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n\n    Now, I'll solve for `a`:\n    `K_star^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))`\n    `a = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K_star^2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (`a_2 / a_1`):** Now I can write the expression for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_p2^2 * G) / (M_star * K_star2^2) ] / [ (M_p1^2 * G) / (M_star * K_star1^2) ]`\n\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) * (K_star1^2 / M_p1^2)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2`\n\n9.  **Calculate the Component Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (`M_p2 / M_p1`):**\n        `M_p1 = 7 M_earth`\n        `M_p2 = 5 M_earth`\n        `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio (`K_star1 / K_star2`):**\n        `K_star1` is proportional to `Δλ_1` (0.03 Å).\n        `K_star2` is proportional to `Δλ_2` (0.04 Å).\n        `K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n10. **Substitute and Solve:** Now I plug these ratios back into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784`\n\n11. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Finally, I return to the simplified temperature ratio from Step 4:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\n12. **Compute the Numerical Value:** To compare with the options, I will perform the final division. I will use a simple python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given mass equivalents\nm1_earth = 7.0\nm2_earth = 5.0\n\n# Given Doppler shifts in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of the stellar radial velocity amplitudes (K_star) is directly\n# proportional to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n# K_star1 / K_star2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\nk_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of the planet masses.\nmass_ratio = m2_earth / m1_earth\n\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes a2/a1 is given by:\n# a2/a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\na2_over_a1 = (mass_ratio)**2 * (k_ratio)**2\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the square root of a2/a1.\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a2_over_a1)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\n<<<answer\nA\n>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    where `T_star` is the star's effective temperature, `A` is the planet's albedo, `R_star` is the star's radius, and `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** Let's write the expression for the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** Several terms in the problem are constant for both planets and will cancel out:\n    *   `T_star` is the same for both.\n    *   `R_star` is the same for both.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (`A_1 = A_2`).\n    *   The constant `2` also cancels.\n\n    After cancellation, the formula simplifies to:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\n    This means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a_2 / a_1`.\n\n5.  **Connect Given Data to the Semi-Major Axis:** The problem provides radial velocity (RV) data in the form of a Doppler shift (`Δλ`).\n    *   The maximum radial velocity of the star induced by a planet (`K_star`, also called the RV semi-amplitude) is related to the Doppler shift by: `K_star = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`. Since `c` and `λ_0` are constants, `K_star` is directly proportional to `Δλ`.\n\n    *   For a planet in a circular orbit, `K_star` is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`), the star's mass (`M_star`), and the semi-major axis (`a`). Assuming the planet's mass is much less than the star's mass (`M_p << M_star`), the formula is:\n        `K_star = (M_p * sin(i)) / sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(G / a)`\n        where `G` is the gravitational constant and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n6.  **Use the Transit Information:** The problem states the planets were detected by both transit and RV methods. A transit requires the orbit to be viewed nearly edge-on, so we can assume the inclination `i` is approximately 90 degrees. This makes `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (`a`):** Rearranging the simplified RV formula to solve for `a`:\n    `K_star = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n    `K_star^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))`\n    `a = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K_star^2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (`a_2 / a_1`):**\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (M_star * K_star2^2)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (M_star * K_star1^2)]`\n\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel, leaving:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) * (K_star1^2 / M_p1^2)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2`\n\n9.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    *   Mass ratio: `M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5/7`\n    *   RV amplitude ratio (proportional to Doppler shift): `K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4`\n\n    Now plug these ratios into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784`\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\n11. **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given mass equivalents in Earth masses\nm1_earth = 7.0\nm2_earth = 5.0\n\n# Given Doppler shifts in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of the stellar radial velocity amplitudes (K_star) is directly\n# proportional to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n# K_star1 / K_star2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\nk_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of the planet masses.\nmass_ratio = m2_earth / m1_earth\n\n# From the radial velocity formula, the semi-major axis 'a' is proportional to (M_p / K_star)^2.\n# Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes a2/a1 is given by:\n# a2/a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\na2_over_a1 = (mass_ratio)**2 * (k_ratio)**2\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the square root of a2/a1.\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a2_over_a1)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
