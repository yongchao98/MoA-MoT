    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n### 1. The Retarded Potentials\n\nThe scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` at a position `r` and time `t` due to a time-varying charge distribution `ρ(r', t')` and current distribution `J(r', t')` are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere `t_r` is the **retarded time**, defined by the condition that the signal (electromagnetic field) traveling from the source at `r'` to the observer at `r` at the speed of light `c` arrives at time `t`.\n$t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}{c}$\n\nThis means the potentials at time `t` are determined by the state of the sources at an earlier time `t_r`.\n\n### 2. Charge and Current Densities for a Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, its velocity is `v(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt`. The charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n\n$\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n### 3. Substituting into the Potential Integrals\n\nWe substitute these densities into the retarded potential formulas. For the scalar potential `V`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\nThe argument of the delta function contains `t_r`, which itself depends on the integration variable `r'`:\n`t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c`\n\nSo the integral is over `δ³(r' - s(t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c))`. To evaluate this, we use the property of delta functions under a change of variables. The integral will be non-zero only at the point `r'_0` where the argument of the delta function is zero:\n$\\vec{r'}_0 = \\vec{s}(t_r)$\nThis is the position of the charge at the retarded time `t_r`.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Integral\n\nThe evaluation of an integral of the form `∫ f(x) δ(g(x)) dx` requires a Jacobian-like factor. For our 3D integral, the result is:\n\n$\\int g(\\vec{r'}) \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r)) d^3r' = \\dfrac{g(\\vec{s}(t_r))}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}}$\n\nwhere:\n*   `\\vec{s}(t_r)` is the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)` is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)` is the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point.\n*   `d = |\\vec{d}|` is the distance from the retarded position to the observation point.\n*   The retarded time `t_r` satisfies the implicit equation `t - t_r = d/c`.\n*   The term in the denominator, `1 - (d · v) / (dc)`, accounts for the fact that the volume of the source region is perceived differently due to the motion of the source (related to the Doppler effect).\n\nApplying this result to the integral for `V`:\nThe function `g(r')` is `q / |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|`. At `r' = s(t_r)`, this becomes `q / d`.\nSo, the integral evaluates to:\n$\\dfrac{q/d}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} = \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nPlugging this back into the formula for `V`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n### 5. Calculating the Vector Potential `A`\n\nThe calculation for the vector potential `A` is analogous. The integrand is now `μ_o / (4π) * (q \\vec{v}(t_r)) / |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|`. The velocity `v(t_r)` is evaluated at the retarded time and is treated as a constant with respect to the spatial integration.\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d} \\right] \\dfrac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Options\n\nThe derived expressions are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}** - This perfectly matches our derived expressions.\n*   B) This option has a `+` sign in the denominator, which is incorrect.\n*   C) This option uses the static Coulomb potential and an incorrect form for `A`. It ignores retardation.\n*   D) This option also uses the incorrect static potential, ignoring retardation.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A. We can also check the relationship between `A` and `V`:\n$\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} \\left( \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right) = (\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}) V = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$\nThis relationship holds for option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
