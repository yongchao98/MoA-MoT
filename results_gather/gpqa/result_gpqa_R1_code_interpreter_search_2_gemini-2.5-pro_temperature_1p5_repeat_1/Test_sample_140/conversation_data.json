    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine (Br) atom at position C1 and a deuterium (D) atom at position C2. All other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen (H) atoms.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n    *   This reaction is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction involving a **benzyne intermediate**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The strong amide base (NH2⁻) removes a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   C6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2. Since both are chemically possible, we must consider both pathways. A C-H bond is generally broken faster than a C-D bond (this is called the kinetic isotope effect), so H-abstraction is the major pathway, but D-abstraction is also a possible pathway.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This forms a carbanion at C6, which then eliminates the bromide ion from C1. This results in a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step.\n        *   Intermediate A: **2-deuterobenzyne** (The triple bond is C1-C6, and the D is at C2).\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This forms a carbanion at C2, which then eliminates the bromide ion from C1. This results in a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the ring in this process.\n        *   Intermediate B: **Benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2⁻), now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to give the final product(s).\n\n    *   **Addition to Intermediate A (2-deuterobenzyne):** The NH2⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6. Protonation by NH3 gives a product with the NH2 group at C1 and the D atom at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1. Protonation by NH3 gives a product with the NH2 group at C6 and the D atom at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the NH2 group the #1 position, the deuterium atom is now at position C3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Pathway A leads to two different products: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n    *   **Addition to Intermediate B (Benzyne):** The NH2⁻ attacks the non-deuterated benzyne.\n        *   Attack can occur at C1 or C2, but since the intermediate is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same product after protonation.\n        *   The product is **aniline** (C6H5NH2), which contains no deuterium.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Products**\n    *   By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n        1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n    *   These three molecules (aniline, ortho-deuterioaniline, and meta-deuterioaniline) are structurally different (they are isotopomers, which are distinct chemical species).\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
