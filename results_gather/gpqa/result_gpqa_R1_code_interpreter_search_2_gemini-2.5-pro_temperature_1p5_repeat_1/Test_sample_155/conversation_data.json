    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the HPLC analyses.\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule as it possesses a C2 axis of rotation and a plane of symmetry through the double bond.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn-addition*. This means the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is planar, the mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability.\n    *   Attack on the trans-alkene produces a trans-epoxide. Because the attack can occur from either face, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides is formed: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed Ring Opening.**\n    *   The epoxide is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This results in an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the epoxide to form a diol.\n    *   The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (Sₙ2-type) attack by a water molecule on one of the epoxide carbons. This is an *anti-opening*.\n    *   The overall reaction (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-opening) is equivalent to an **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene.\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **trans-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound**.\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   Starting with (4R,5R)-epoxide, backside attack by water at C4 inverts its stereocenter from R to S. The configuration at C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Starting with (4S,5S)-epoxide, backside attack by water at C4 inverts its stereocenter from S to R. The configuration at C5 remains S. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are designations for the same single **meso** compound. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   H\n    ```\n\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   The syn-addition of the oxygen atom to the cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide.\n    *   Because the starting (Z)-oct-4-ene is achiral and has a plane of symmetry, the resulting epoxide is a single **meso** compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed Ring Opening.**\n    *   As before, this is an anti-opening, and the overall transformation is an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **cis-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   Let's verify this with the meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane):\n        *   The two carbons (C4 and C5) of the meso-epoxide are enantiotopic. Attack by water is equally likely at either carbon.\n        *   Backside attack at C4 (R-center) inverts its configuration to S. The C5 configuration remains S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Backside attack at C5 (S-center) inverts its configuration to R. The C4 configuration remains R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   Since both attacks are equally probable, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is a **racemic mixture**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of enantiomeric diols.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture, combined from both reactions, contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nNote that the meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n\n### **HPLC Chromatography**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity and size.\n    *   **Enantiomers**, such as (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers**, such as the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair, have different physical properties. They will be separated by the achiral column and will elute at different times.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Since all three stereoisomers in the mixture (meso, (4R,5R), and (4S,5S)) are distinct, they will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### **Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
