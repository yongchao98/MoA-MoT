    "This problem requires an understanding of gene expression and the effects of different types of mutations on the final protein product. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to inactivate a gene, thereby preventing the synthesis of an anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Intact Gene**\n\nFirst, let's establish the baseline by translating the beginning of the intact gene's coding sequence (the first exon) into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’`\n*   **Codon Breakdown and Translation:**\n    *   `ATG`: Methionine (M) - This is the universal **Start Codon**.\n    *   `TTT`: Phenylalanine (F)\n    *   `CTC`: Leucine (L)\n    *   `GCT`: Alanine (A)\n    *   `GGT`: Glycine (G)\n    *   `ACT`: Threonine (T)\n    *   **Intact Protein Start:** M - F - L - A - G - T - ...\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Each Mutant and its Effect**\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant sequence, identify the type of mutation, and predict its consequence for the protein. We are looking for the mutation most likely to create a non-functional (\"knockout\") protein.\n\n#### **Mutant 1**\n\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n*   **Comparison to Intact:**\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (F). This is a **silent mutation** (no change in the amino acid).\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAC`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (L), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Y). This is a **missense mutation**, meaning it changes a single amino acid in the protein.\n*   **Effect:** The resulting protein will have a Tyrosine instead of a Leucine. This might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to completely eliminate it. The protein is still produced at its full length.\n\n#### **Mutant 2**\n\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n*   **Comparison to Intact:**\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. This is the same silent mutation as in Mutant 1.\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAA`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (L), but `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The introduction of a premature stop codon will cause the ribosome to terminate translation. The resulting \"protein\" will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A protein this truncated is virtually certain to be non-functional.\n\n#### **Mutant 3**\n\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n*   **Comparison to Intact:**\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine). Missense mutation.\n    *   Codon 6: `ACT` (Threonine) -> `GTC` (Valine). Missense mutation.\n    *   And others. The sequence has multiple changes.\n*   **Effect:** This mutant has multiple **missense mutations**. Several amino acids are changed, but the protein is still translated to its full length. While changing multiple amino acids increases the chance of inactivating the protein compared to a single missense mutation, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n#### **Mutant 4**\n\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n*   **Comparison to Intact:** A careful alignment shows a change and a deletion.\n    *   Intact: `...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   Mutant: `...TAC GCT --- ACT...`\n    *   This represents a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`) and the deletion of one entire codon (`GGT`).\n*   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of a number of bases divisible by 3). The reading frame is maintained, but one amino acid (Glycine) is missing from the final protein. Like a missense mutation, this may or may not eliminate function, depending on the importance of the deleted amino acid.\n\n### **Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nTo *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need the mutation that is most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Missense mutations (Mutant 1, 3)** and **in-frame deletions (Mutant 4)** produce a full-length or near-full-length protein with some altered amino acids. Function *might* be lost, but it's not a certainty.\n*   A **nonsense mutation (Mutant 2)** introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene. This truncates the protein drastically, making it almost certain to be non-functional.\n\nTherefore, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most reliable and probable way to eliminate the function of the gene and the production of the unwanted compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
