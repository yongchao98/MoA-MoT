    "This question asks which of the listed physical theories does not require a procedure called \"regularization\" to handle issues that arise at high energies (or, equivalently, at very short distances). Let's break down why each option does or does not require this.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n*   **Divergence:** In physics, particularly in quantum field theory, calculations for physical quantities sometimes yield an infinite result. These infinities are called divergences.\n*   **High-Energy (Ultraviolet) Divergence:** This type of divergence occurs in quantum field theories when calculating the contributions of virtual particles in loops (loop diagrams). The integrals over all possible momenta of these virtual particles can diverge as the momentum goes to infinity. This is known as an ultraviolet (UV) divergence.\n*   **Regularization:** This is a mathematical technique used to manage these infinities. It involves temporarily modifying the theory to make the divergent integrals finite. This is often done by introducing a \"cutoff,\" an artificial limit (e.g., a maximum energy Λ) on the integrals. Once the calculation is done, one can study the behavior of the result as the cutoff is removed (Λ → ∞).\n*   **Renormalization:** After regularization, a subsequent process called renormalization is used to absorb the infinite parts (which depend on the cutoff) into the definitions of the physical parameters of the theory, such as mass and charge. This procedure leaves behind finite, predictive, and physically meaningful results.\n\n### Analysis of the Options\n\n*   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory describes the interactions of charged particles and electromagnetic fields without quantum mechanics. It suffers from its own divergence problem. The self-energy of a point-like electron (the energy of its own electric field) is infinite. If you integrate the energy density of the electric field of a point charge, the integral diverges as you get closer to the point. This is a short-distance problem that suggests the classical theory is incomplete. To \"fix\" this, one might assume the electron has a finite radius, which is a form of regularization. So, even the classical theory has problems at short distances that require some kind of ad-hoc modification.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum theory of electromagnetism. It was the first theory where the need for regularization and renormalization became critically important. Calculations of physical quantities, like the correction to an electron's mass or charge due to interactions with virtual photons, lead to divergent loop integrals. The development of a systematic regularization and renormalization scheme for QED by Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga was a monumental achievement in physics. Therefore, QED absolutely requires regularization.\n\n*   **B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum theory of the strong nuclear force, which governs quarks and gluons. Like QED, QCD is a quantum field theory. It also involves loop diagrams that lead to ultraviolet divergences. Therefore, QCD also requires regularization and renormalization to make physical predictions.\n\n*   **D) Superstring Theory:** One of the primary motivations for developing string theory was to solve the problem of infinities that plague quantum field theories, especially when trying to include gravity. In string theory, fundamental particles are not point-like but are instead tiny, vibrating one-dimensional strings. Interactions, therefore, do not occur at a single point in spacetime but are \"smeared out.\" This fundamental difference has a profound consequence: the loop diagrams in string theory do not have the same short-distance/high-energy divergences found in point-particle quantum field theories. The finite size of the strings provides a natural physical cutoff, making the calculated scattering amplitudes finite. For this reason, superstring theory is believed to be \"UV-finite\" and does not require the artificial procedure of regularization to handle high-energy infinities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nQuantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are quantum field theories that famously require regularization. Classical Electrodynamics also has a divergence problem at short distances. Superstring Theory, by its very construction, avoids these high-energy ultraviolet divergences and is therefore the theory that never requires regularization for this purpose.\n\n<<<D>>>"
