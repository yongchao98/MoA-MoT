    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   The reaction is: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.\n    *   This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction.\n    *   **Starting material:** butan-2-one, a ketone.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a strong nucleophile from NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃.\n        3.  To form the final product, the negatively charged oxygen atom of the alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated. This requires a proton source.\n    *   **Identifying Reagent A:** Reagent A must provide the proton (H⁺) for the protonation step.\n        *   **H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion)** is a strong acid and an excellent source of protons. It is commonly used in an acidic workup step to protonate intermediates like the alkoxide formed here.\n        *   **NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite)** reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products. It does not provide the necessary proton to form a cyanohydrin from the reaction with NaCN.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**. This represents the acidification step required to complete the cyanohydrin formation.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   The reaction is: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base. The presence of water (H₂O) as a reactant is key.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong acid catalyst (like HCl or H₂SO₄) and water, the nitrile is first protonated, making the carbon more electrophilic for water to attack. Through a series of steps, an amide intermediate is formed, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion.\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong base (like NaOH), the hydroxide ion attacks the nitrile carbon. This leads to the formation of a carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻) and ammonia. A final acidification step is needed to get the carboxylic acid (R-COOH).\n    *   **Identifying Reagent B:** The product is the carboxylic acid directly, not a salt, which strongly suggests an acid-catalyzed pathway.\n        *   **HCl (hydrochloric acid)** is a strong acid and a standard reagent for catalyzing the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (acetic acid)** is a weak acid. While it could protonate the nitrile, the reaction rate would be extremely slow, and it is not a typical reagent for achieving complete hydrolysis. A strong acid is required for an efficient reaction.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B is HCl.\n    *   Matching this with the given options, we find that option A fits our analysis.\n\n<<<A>>>"
