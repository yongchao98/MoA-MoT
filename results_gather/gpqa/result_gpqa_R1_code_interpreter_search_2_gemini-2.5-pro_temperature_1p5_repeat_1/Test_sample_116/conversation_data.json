    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe user wants to identify which of the given molecules exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Step 1: Understand the core concept.** Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) is a common cause of chirality. Another cause is axial chirality, which can be found in molecules like substituted biphenyls (atropisomers).\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze each compound individually.**\n\n    *   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n        *   **Identify the molecule type:** This is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyl molecules consist of two phenyl rings connected by a single C-C bond.\n        *   **Check for chirality:** In biphenyls, if there are large, bulky groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is restricted. This phenomenon is called steric hindrance.\n        *   **Apply the concept to the molecule:** This molecule has bulky substituents at all four ortho positions: nitro groups (-NO2) at 6 and 6', and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at 2 and 2'. These groups are large enough to prevent the rings from rotating freely and becoming coplanar.\n        *   **Assess for symmetry:** Because of this restricted rotation, the molecule is locked into a non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This type of chirality is known as axial chirality, and the isomers are called atropisomers.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   **Identify the molecule type:** This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n        *   **Check for chirality:** Look for chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n        *   **Apply the concept to the molecule:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2, the one attached to the hydroxyl group (-OH). The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n            1.  Hydrogen (-H)\n            2.  Hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  Methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  Methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since all four groups are different, the C2 atom is a chiral center.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Thus, it will have two enantiomers (R and S forms) and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n        *   **Identify the molecule type:** This is a diaryl ketone, with the formula (C6H5)2CO.\n        *   **Check for chirality:** We need to look for any elements of chirality (like chiral centers) and elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry).\n        *   **Apply the concept to the molecule:** The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It is sp2-hybridized and only bonded to three groups, so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and contains the C=O group. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   **Identify the molecule type:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is *trans*-CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n        *   **Check for chirality:** The molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond.\n        *   **Apply the concept to the molecule:** The molecule is planar due to the sp2 hybridization of the double-bonded carbons. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself) and is therefore achiral. Additionally, due to its *trans* configuration, dimethyl fumarate possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. (It does exhibit geometric isomerism with its *cis* counterpart, dimethyl maleate, but the question is about optical isomerism).\n\n*   **Step 3: Synthesize the findings and choose the correct option.**\n    *   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   Therefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
