    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\n    *   The starting molecule is **5-butylnona-2,6-diene**.\n    *   Let's first draw the structure based on its IUPAC name.\n        *   \"nona\" indicates a 9-carbon main chain.\n        *   \"-2,6-diene\" indicates two double bonds starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n        *   \"5-butyl\" indicates a butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n    *   The structure is:\n        `CH₃(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(5)(C₄H₉)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₃(9)`\n        (Numbering from left to right gives the lowest locants for the double bonds, 2 and 6).\n    *   The reaction condition is \"heating\". For a molecule like this, which contains a hexa-1,5-diene structural motif, heating strongly suggests a pericyclic reaction, specifically a **[3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement** known as the **Cope rearrangement**.\n\n2.  **Identify the System for the Cope Rearrangement**\n    *   The Cope rearrangement involves a system of 6 carbons arranged as a 1,5-diene (i.e., `C=C-C-C-C=C`).\n    *   In our molecule, the chain of atoms `C(2)=C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)=C(7)` forms this 1,5-diene system.\n    *   Let's number these six atoms specifically for the rearrangement mechanism:\n        *   `C(2)` is atom 1'\n        *   `C(3)` is atom 2'\n        *   `C(4)` is atom 3'\n        *   `C(5)` is atom 4'\n        *   `C(6)` is atom 5'\n        *   `C(7)` is atom 6'\n    *   The key bond transformations in a Cope rearrangement are:\n        *   The sigma bond between atoms 3' and 4' breaks. In our molecule, this is the **C(4)-C(5) bond**.\n        *   A new sigma bond forms between atoms 1' and 6'. In our molecule, this is a **new bond between C(2) and C(7)**.\n        *   The π-bond between atoms 1' and 2' moves to between 2' and 3'. The `C(2)=C(3)` double bond moves to **`C(3)=C(4)`**.\n        *   The π-bond between atoms 5' and 6' moves to between 4' and 5'. The `C(6)=C(7)` double bond moves to **`C(5)=C(6)`**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Product**\n    *   Let's trace the connectivity of the atoms in the product molecule based on the bond changes described above.\n    *   **Original connections:** `CH₃-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)` is connected to `CH(5)(Butyl)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂CH₃` via the C(4)-C(5) bond.\n    *   **New connections:** The `CH₃-CH(2)-CH(3)=CH₂(4)` fragment is now connected to the `(Butyl)CH(5)=CH(6)-CH(7)-CH₂CH₃` fragment via a new bond between C(2) and C(7).\n    *   Let's assemble the product structure:\n        *   Start with the newly formed C(2)-C(7) bond.\n        *   Attach the groups that were originally on C(2) and C(7). C(2) had a methyl group (C1) and was attached to C(3). C(7) had an ethyl group (C8-C9) and was attached to C(6).\n        *   So we have a central structure: `...-CH(C2)(CH₃) - CH(C7)(CH₂CH₃)-...`\n        *   Now attach the rest of the fragments according to the new bonding. C(2) is now single-bonded to C(3), which is double-bonded to C(4). This gives: `CH₂(4)=CH(3)-CH(C2)(CH₃)-...`.\n        *   C(7) is now single-bonded to C(6), which is double-bonded to C(5). C(5) still has the butyl group. This gives: `...-CH(C7)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(6)=CH(5)(Butyl)`.\n    *   Putting it all together, the product is:\n        `CH₂(4)=CH(3)-CH(C2)(CH₃)-CH(C7)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(6)=CH(5)(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃)`\n\n4.  **Name the Product Using IUPAC Nomenclature**\n    *   First, we must identify the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups (the two double bonds).\n    *   The core of the diene system is `C(4)=C(3)-C(2)-C(7)-C(6)=C(5)`. To find the main chain, we must extend from the ends of this system (C4 and C5).\n    *   The C(4) atom is a `CH₂`, so the chain terminates there on that side.\n    *   The C(5) atom is attached to a butyl group. The chain continues through the butyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the main chain is: `C(4)=C(3)-C(2)-C(7)-C(6)=C(5)-[butyl chain]`.\n    *   Let's count the carbons in this chain: C4, C3, C2, C7, C6, C5, plus the 4 carbons of the butyl group. Total = 10 carbons. The parent alkane is decane. Since it has two double bonds, it's a **decadiene**.\n    *   Next, we number the chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants.\n        *   Numbering from the C(4) end: `C(4)` is 1, `C(3)` is 2, `C(2)` is 3, `C(7)` is 4, `C(6)` is 5, `C(5)` is 6. The double bonds start at carbons **1** and **5**. So it is a **deca-1,5-diene**.\n        *   Numbering from the other end (the end of the butyl group) would give higher locants (5 and 9). So, the first numbering is correct.\n    *   Finally, we identify and name the substituents on this main chain.\n        *   On carbon 3 of our new chain (which is the original C2 atom), there is a **methyl group** (`-CH₃`).\n        *   On carbon 4 of our new chain (which is the original C7 atom), there is an **ethyl group** (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n    *   Assembling the full IUPAC name (listing substituents alphabetically): **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options**\n    *   The derived name, 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene, matches option A.\n\n    A) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n    B) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    C) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n    D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n\nThe correct product is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
