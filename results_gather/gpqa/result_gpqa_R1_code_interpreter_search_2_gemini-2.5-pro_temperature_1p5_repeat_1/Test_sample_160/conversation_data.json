    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the two Mean Free Paths:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. It describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the electrons from the electron beam. It describes the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall the General Formula for Mean Free Path:**\n    The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ).\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n    In this problem, the gas conditions (temperature, pressure, volume) are constant, which means the number density `n` of the gas molecules is the same for both scenarios. Therefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 must arise from the difference in their respective effective collision cross-sections.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Collision Cross-Section for λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   For λ1, we are considering a gas molecule moving through a gas of other, identical molecules.\n    *   The moving particle (projectile) is a gas molecule of diameter `d`. The target particle is also a gas molecule of diameter `d`.\n    *   In the simplified hard-sphere model, a collision occurs if the centers of the two molecules come within a distance `d` of each other. The collision cross-section is σ = πd².\n    *   Crucially, the target gas molecules are not stationary; they are also moving with thermal velocities. The kinetic theory of gases accounts for this by introducing a factor of the square root of 2 (√2) to account for the average relative velocity.\n    *   Therefore, the effective collision cross-section for gas-gas collisions is σ_gg_eff = √2 * π * d².\n    *   This gives the formula for λ1:\n        λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gg_eff) = 1 / (n * √2 * π * d²)\n\n4.  **Analyze the Collision Cross-Section for λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   For λ2, we are considering a high-energy electron (projectile) moving through the gas of molecules (targets).\n    *   The electrons are accelerated by 1000 kV, meaning they travel at speeds very close to the speed of light. The gas molecules, with their relatively slow thermal velocities, can be considered effectively stationary. Thus, the √2 factor is not needed for this calculation.\n    *   The electron is a fundamental particle, and its physical size is negligible compared to a gas molecule. We can treat it as a point particle.\n    *   In a simple hard-sphere model, a collision occurs if the point-like electron passes within the radius (d/2) of the gas molecule. The collision cross-section is the area of the molecule: σ_eg = π * (d/2)² = πd²/4.\n    *   This gives a formula for λ2 based on this simple model:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg) = 1 / (n * πd²/4) = 4 / (n * πd²)\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    Let's find the ratio λ2 / λ1 using the formulas derived from the hard-sphere model:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [ 4 / (n * πd²) ] / [ 1 / (n * √2 * π * d²) ]\n    λ2 / λ1 = 4 * √2\n    Since √2 ≈ 1.414, the ratio is:\n    λ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\n6.  **Consider Refinements (Beyond the Simple Model):**\n    The hard-sphere model is an approximation. In reality, the interaction between a high-energy electron and a gas molecule is governed by quantum electrodynamics. The scattering cross-section for high-energy electrons on atoms/molecules is known to be significantly smaller than the geometric cross-section (πd²/4). A smaller cross-section (σ_eg) means a larger mean free path (λ2).\n    Therefore, a more realistic physical model would predict an even larger ratio for λ2 / λ1, making λ2 much greater than λ1.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    Our analysis shows that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1 (λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1 in a simple model, and even larger in a more realistic one). Let's check the given options:\n    A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is incorrect. The ratio λ2/λ1 is much larger than 1.22.\n    B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is incorrect. The physical parameters of the collision are fundamentally different.\n    C) λ2 < λ1: This is incorrect. A smaller and faster projectile interacting with a stationary target leads to a longer mean free path, not a shorter one.\n    D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This is the correct conclusion. Our calculated ratio of ~5.66 is well within this inequality. The number 1.22 simply serves as a threshold that is easily surpassed by the predictions of any reasonable physical model.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe collision cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule is significantly smaller than the effective collision cross-section for a gas molecule with another gas molecule. Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section, the mean free path for the electron (λ2) must be significantly larger than the mean free path for the gas molecule (λ1).\n\n<<<D>>>"
