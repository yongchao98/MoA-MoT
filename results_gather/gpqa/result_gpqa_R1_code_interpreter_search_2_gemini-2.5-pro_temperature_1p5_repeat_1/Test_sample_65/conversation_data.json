    "*   **Analyze the Question:** The question asks which symmetries are fundamental requirements for constructing the operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT).\n\n*   **What is SMEFT?** SMEFT is an effective field theory that extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators. These new operators are constructed using the SM fields and are suppressed by a high-energy scale Î›. The key point is that SMEFT is built upon the fundamental principles of the SM and relativistic quantum field theory (QFT).\n\n*   **Evaluate each symmetry:**\n\n    1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is the symmetry of spacetime under rotations and boosts. It is a cornerstone of special relativity and all modern particle physics theories, including the Standard Model. Any local quantum field theory, which SMEFT is, must be Lorentz invariant. The operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry **must** be respected.\n\n    2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** This is the full symmetry group of spacetime in special relativity, which includes Lorentz transformations (item 1) plus spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a fundamental assumption in the construction of any relativistic QFT. Therefore, Poincare symmetry **must** be respected.\n\n    3.  **CP Symmetry (Charge-Parity):** This symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model by the weak interaction (e.g., as described by the complex phase in the CKM matrix). Since the SM itself violates CP, there is no reason to impose this symmetry on the higher-dimensional SMEFT operators. In fact, SMEFT provides new potential sources for CP violation, which are actively being searched for in experiments. Therefore, CP symmetry is **not** required.\n\n    4.  **CPT Symmetry (Charge-Parity-Time Reversal):** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in QFT. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian is automatically symmetric under the combined transformation of C, P, and T. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must respect CPT symmetry. Violating CPT would require a radical departure from the standard framework of QFT. Therefore, CPT symmetry **must** be respected.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4).\n\n*   **Match with options:** The combination {1, 2, 4} corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
