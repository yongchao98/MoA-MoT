    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Vector Field:**\n    The problem describes a vector field `f(r)` that has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n2.  **State the Goal:**\n    The objective is to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∇.f`, within a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. Mathematically, we need to evaluate:\n    `∫_V (∇.f) dV`\n    where `V` is the volume of the sphere.\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem):**\n    The vector field `f(r) = 1/r^2` is singular (undefined) at the origin `r = 0`. Calculating the divergence `∇.f` directly would yield 0 for all `r ≠ 0`, but it would be undefined at the origin. This suggests that the divergence at the origin is a Dirac delta function. A more straightforward method to handle such singularities is to use the Divergence Theorem.\n\n    The Divergence Theorem relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the vector field over the boundary of the volume:\n    `∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n    where `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V`. In this case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n4.  **Define the Surface Element `dS`:**\n    For a sphere of radius `R`, the differential surface element `dS` in spherical coordinates points radially outward and has a magnitude `R^2 * sin(theta) * d(theta) * d(phi)`. As a vector, it is:\n    `dS = (R^2 * sin(theta) * d(theta) * d(phi)) * r_hat`\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Field on the Surface `S`:**\n    The vector field `f(r)` on the surface of the sphere (where `r = R`) is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Dot Product `f . dS`:**\n    Now, we compute the dot product of the field on the surface and the surface element:\n    `f . dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] . [ (R^2 * sin(theta) * d(theta) * d(phi)) * r_hat ]`\n    Since `r_hat . r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n    `f . dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(theta) * d(theta) * d(phi)`\n    `f . dS = sin(theta) * d(theta) * d(phi)`\n\n7.  **Compute the Surface Integral:**\n    Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for `phi` are from 0 to `2π`, and for `theta` are from 0 to `π`.\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = ∫(phi=0 to 2π) ∫(theta=0 to π) sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi)`\n\n    First, integrate with respect to `theta`:\n    `∫(from 0 to π) sin(theta) d(theta) = [-cos(theta)](from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Next, integrate the result with respect to `phi`:\n    `∫(from 0 to 2π) 2 d(phi) = [2*phi](from 0 to 2π) = 2*(2π) - 2*(0) = 4π`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    `∫_V (∇.f) dV = 4π`\n\n    This result is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism (Gauss's Law for a point charge), where the flux of the electric field (which falls off as `1/r^2`) through a closed surface enclosing the charge is a constant (`q/ε₀`), independent of the radius of the surface.\n\nComparing the result `4π` with the given options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 0\nC) 4 π\nD) 1\n\nThe most appropriate answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
