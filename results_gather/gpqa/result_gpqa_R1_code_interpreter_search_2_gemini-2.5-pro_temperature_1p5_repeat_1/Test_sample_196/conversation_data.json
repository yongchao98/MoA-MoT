  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the IR spectrum to identify functional groups in Compound X.**\n    *   The broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretches within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum to determine the structure of Compound X.**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield, broad singlet for one proton is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the other substituent (an alkyl group).\n    *   **Alkyl group analysis:** We need to assemble the remaining fragments: a CH (1H), a CH₂ (2H), and two CH₃ groups (3H each).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This is the benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). Its multiplicity (m) indicates it's coupled to multiple neighboring protons.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** This doublet is a methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a single proton. This proton must be the benzylic proton at 2.9 ppm. This gives us a -CH(CH₃)- fragment attached to the ring.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** This triplet is another methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to two protons, i.e., a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This multiplet is the methylene group (-CH₂-) that is coupled to both the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and the benzylic proton at 2.9 ppm.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Connecting the pieces, the benzylic -CH- is attached to both a -CH₃ group and a -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl) group. The complete structure of the alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a *sec*-butyl group.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deduce the complete structure of Compound X.**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Compound X is a benzoic acid with a *sec*-butyl group at the para (position 4) position.\n    *   The structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the reaction and predict the final product.**\n    *   The reagent is **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   This reagent is known to reduce a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group completely down to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The reaction will reduce the -COOH of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid to a -CH₃ group. The aromatic ring and the *sec*-butyl side chain will remain unchanged.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Reaction:** -COOH → -CH₃\n    *   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the final product with the given options.**\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect side chain.\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches our predicted product.\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This is an entirely different structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
