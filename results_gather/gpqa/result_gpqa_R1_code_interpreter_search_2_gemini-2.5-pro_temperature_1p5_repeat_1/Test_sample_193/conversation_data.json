    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the partition function Z for the given system.\n\n### 1. Identify the States of the System\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 possible microstates for the system. We can list them as (S1, S2, S3):\n1.  ( +1, +1, +1 )\n2.  ( +1, +1, -1 )\n3.  ( +1, -1, +1 )\n4.  ( -1, +1, +1 )\n5.  ( +1, -1, -1 )\n6.  ( -1, +1, -1 )\n7.  ( -1, -1, +1 )\n8.  ( -1, -1, -1 )\n\n### 2. Define the Partition Function (Z)\nThe partition function is the sum over all possible states (i) of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE_i), where E_i is the energy of the i-th state and β = 1/(kT).\nZ = Σ_i e^(-βE_i)\n\n### 3. Calculate the Energy for Each State\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]\n\nWe will now calculate the energy for each of the 8 microstates. It's helpful to group states with the same energy.\n\n**Group 1: All spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1)**\n*   **State (+1, +1, +1):**\n    E = -J [ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n*   **State (-1, -1, -1):**\n    E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n\nThere are **2 states** with an energy of **E = -3J**.\n\n**Group 2: One spin is different from the other two**\nThis group includes states with two +1 spins and one -1 spin, and states with two -1 spins and one +1 spin.\n*   **State (+1, +1, -1):**\n    E = -J [ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J [ -1 ] = +J\n*   **State (+1, -1, +1):**\n    E = -J [ (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J [ -1 ] = +J\n*   **State (-1, +1, +1):**\n    E = -J [ (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J [ -1 ] = +J\n*   **State (+1, -1, -1):**\n    E = -J [ (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J [ -1 ] = +J\n*   **State (-1, +1, -1):**\n    E = -J [ (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J [ -1 ] = +J\n*   **State (-1, -1, +1):**\n    E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J [ -1 ] = +J\n\nThere are **6 states** with an energy of **E = +J**.\n\n### 4. Sum the Boltzmann Factors\nNow we can write the partition function by summing the contributions from each energy level, taking into account the number of states (degeneracy) at each level.\n\n*   Contribution from the E = -3J level (degeneracy = 2):\n    2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ)\n*   Contribution from the E = +J level (degeneracy = 6):\n    6 * e^(-β * (+J)) = 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nSumming these contributions gives the total partition function Z:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\nC) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
