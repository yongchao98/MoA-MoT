    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Relationships:**\n    *   **Parallax and Distance:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. We can write this as `plx ∝ 1/d` or `d ∝ 1/plx`. For simplicity, let's use the standard definition where `d = 1/plx` (with `d` in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds).\n    *   **Uniform Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars (`ρ`), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:**\n    *   Consider a spherical volume of space with radius `d`. The volume `V` of this sphere is given by `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` within this volume is `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   From this, we can see that the total number of stars up to a distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance: `N ∝ d³`.\n\n3.  **Express Number of Stars in terms of Parallax:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the relationship between distance and parallax (`d ∝ 1/plx`) into the expression for the number of stars:\n    *   `N ∝ (1/plx)³`\n    *   `N ∝ 1/plx³`\n    *   This equation tells us that the *cumulative* number of stars with a parallax greater than or equal to `plx` (i.e., all stars within a certain distance `d = 1/plx`) is proportional to `1/plx³`.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars *per Unit Range* of Parallax:**\n    *   The question is not about the cumulative number `N`, but about how the number of stars changes *per unit range of parallax*. This is a rate, which mathematically means we need to find the derivative of `N` with respect to `plx`, which is `dN/d(plx)`. This quantity represents the density of stars in parallax space.\n    *   Let's write the proportionality from step 3 as an equation: `N = k * plx⁻³`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n    *   Now, we differentiate `N` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (k * plx⁻³)`\n        `dN/d(plx) = k * (-3 * plx⁻⁴)`\n        `dN/d(plx) = -3k / plx⁴`\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as the parallax `plx` increases (i.e., we look at closer stars in a smaller volume), the cumulative star count `N` decreases. The magnitude of the relationship is what's important.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
