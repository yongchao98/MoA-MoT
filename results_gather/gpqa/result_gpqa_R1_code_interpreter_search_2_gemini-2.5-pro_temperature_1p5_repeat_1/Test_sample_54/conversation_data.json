    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons and Gross Structure**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integrations from the 1H NMR data to find the total number of protons in the molecule:\n1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of protons for each possible compound:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (Cis or Trans):** The structure is CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₃. The molecular formula is C₅H₈O₂. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 (from the acetate methyl) + 1 (vinylic) + 1 (vinylic) + 3 (from the propenyl methyl) = **8 protons**. This matches the experimental data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (Cis or Trans):** The structure is CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃. The molecular formula is C₆H₁₀O₂. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = **10 protons**. This does not match the experimental data.\n\nBased on the proton count, we can confidently eliminate both Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate. The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chemical Shifts and Splitting Patterns**\n\nLet's break down the 1H NMR signals for propenyl acetate (CH₃(a)-COO-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d)) and assign them.\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (an acetyl group).\n    *   **Splitting (s, singlet):** Indicates there are no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the acetate methyl group, CH₃(a).\n\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This region is characteristic of an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a double bond).\n    *   **Splitting (d, doublet):** Indicates it is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the propenyl methyl group, CH₃(d), which is split by the adjacent vinylic proton H(c).\n\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm (Vinylic Protons):**\n    *   These two signals represent the two protons on the double bond, H(b) and H(c). They are in different chemical environments and split each other.\n    *   The proton H(b) is on a carbon bonded to an oxygen atom, which is strongly electron-withdrawing. This deshields the proton, causing it to appear at a higher chemical shift (further downfield). Therefore, the signal at **7.0 ppm** is H(b).\n    *   The proton H(c) is adjacent to H(b) and the methyl group CH₃(d). Therefore, the signal at **5.5 ppm** is H(c).\n    *   Let's check the splitting:\n        *   **H(b) at 7.0 ppm (1H, d):** It's a doublet because it's only split by the other vinylic proton, H(c). This matches the data.\n        *   **H(c) at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** It's a doublet of quartets because it's split into a doublet by H(b) and each of those peaks is further split into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group, CH₃(d). This also matches the data.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is to determine whether the double bond is in the *cis* or *trans* configuration. This is revealed by the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\n*   The signal for H(b) is given as **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**.\n*   The coupling constant between these two protons is **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\nThe magnitude of the coupling constant between vinylic protons is highly dependent on their geometric relationship:\n*   **Trans-coupling (³J_trans):** Typically ranges from 11-18 Hz.\n*   **Cis-coupling (³J_cis):** Typically ranges from 6-15 Hz (and is almost always smaller than trans-coupling for a given system).\n\nThe observed J-value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely within the typical range for a **trans** configuration. A cis isomer would exhibit a significantly smaller coupling constant, likely around 10-12 Hz.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the number of protons, chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and coupling constants all consistently point to one structure: **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
