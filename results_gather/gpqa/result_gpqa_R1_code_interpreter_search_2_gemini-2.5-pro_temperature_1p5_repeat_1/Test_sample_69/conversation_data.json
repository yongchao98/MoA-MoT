    "This is a chemical riddle that requires identifying a series of unknown substances (A through H) based on their reactions. The final goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\nLet's break down the clues step-by-step to identify the compounds.\n\n**Clue 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.**\n\nThis is a very informative clue. The hydrolysis of a single substance (C) producing two acids, one strong and one weak, is characteristic of specific types of compounds. A classic example is a sulfur halide. The disproportionation of a sulfur halide in water can yield elemental sulfur, a strong hydrohalic acid, and a weak sulfur oxoacid.\n\nLet's follow this hypothesis:\n*   The reaction is a disproportionation where some sulfur atoms are reduced back to elemental sulfur (reforming A), while others are oxidized to a weak acid (G). The halide part forms a strong acid (F).\n*   Let's assume the halogen is chlorine. Then the strong acid **F** is **hydrochloric acid (HCl)**.\n*   The weak acid **G** would be a sulfur oxoacid, most likely **sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃)**, formed from the hydration of SO₂.\n*   This implies that **A** is elemental sulfur. Sulfur exists as a solid, most commonly as **S₈**.\n*   Substance **C** must be a sulfur chloride.\n*   Substance **B** must be a chlorinating gas. The simplest choice is **chlorine gas (Cl₂)**.\n\n**Clue 1: reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.**\n\nLet's check if this fits our hypothesis.\n*   A = S₈ (solid)\n*   B = Cl₂ (gas)\n*   The reaction is S₈ + B -> C. The stoichiometry is given as 1:8. Let's consider the reaction on a per-sulfur-atom basis. If we consider A as 8 moles of S atoms, then we have `8S + 8Cl₂ -> 8SCl₂`. This reaction has a 1:1 molar ratio of S to Cl₂, which can be interpreted as 1 mole of S₈ reacting with 8 moles of Cl₂ to produce 8 moles of SCl₂.\n*   The product **C** would be **sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) **. Sulfur dichloride is a cherry-red liquid, which reasonably fits the description \"bright red product\".\n\nSo far, our assignments are:\n*   A = S₈\n*   B = Cl₂\n*   C = SCl₂\n*   F = HCl\n*   G = H₂SO₃\n\n**Clue 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.**\n\n*   B = Cl₂. The clue is: D(gas) + Cl₂(gas) -> H(solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   A well-known reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene: `CO + Cl₂ -> COCl₂`.\n*   Let's test this:\n    *   **D = Carbon monoxide (CO)**, which is a gas.\n    *   **H = Phosgene (COCl₂) **. Phosgene is a gas at room temperature (b.p. 8 °C) but is used as a reagent and solvent in organic chemistry, often in condensed form or in solution. This fits the description.\n\n**Clue 2: When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.**\n\nNow we can identify the final unknown, E.\n*   C = SCl₂\n*   D = CO\n*   The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2CO -> E\n*   While this is not a common reaction, we can deduce the products by considering atom exchange. A plausible, known reaction pathway is: SCl₂ + CO -> COS + Cl₂. The newly formed Cl₂ then reacts with the second equivalent of CO: Cl₂ + CO -> COCl₂.\n*   The overall reaction is: `SCl₂ + 2CO -> COS + COCl₂`.\n*   The products are carbonyl sulfide (COS) and phosgene (COCl₂), both of which are extremely hazardous gases. The puzzle asks for a singular product \"E\". This often happens in such riddles where one of the products is the intended answer. Both are hazardous, but phosgene (COCl₂) is particularly notorious as a chemical warfare agent. Furthermore, we've already identified phosgene as substance H. It is common for these puzzles to reuse a compound. Therefore, it's highly likely that **E = Phosgene (COCl₂) **.\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\nNow we need to find the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E = COCl₂.\n1.  **Structure:** Phosgene has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. The molecule is planar with a trigonal planar geometry around the carbon.\n    ```\n       O\n      //\n     C\n    /  \\\n   Cl  Cl\n    ```\n2.  **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **C₂ axis:** There is a twofold rotational axis (a 180° rotation leaves the molecule unchanged) that passes through the C and O atoms, bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n    *   **σᵥ mirror planes:** There are two vertical mirror planes.\n        1.  One plane contains all four atoms (the plane of the molecule).\n        2.  The second plane is perpendicular to the first one and contains the C₂ axis (i.e., it contains the O and C atoms and bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle).\n3.  **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses a C₂ axis and two mirror planes containing that axis belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) D∞h\nB) C2v\nC) D4h\nD) C2\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
