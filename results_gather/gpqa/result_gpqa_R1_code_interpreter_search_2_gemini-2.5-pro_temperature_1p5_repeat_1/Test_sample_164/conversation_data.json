    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Problem:** The scientist wants to modify an ethylene polymerization process.\n    *   **Starting Process:** Polymerization of ethylene to produce a linear polymer (High-Density Polyethylene, HDPE).\n    *   **Goal:** Introduce *regular branches* into the polymer backbone.\n    *   **Constraint:** Use *only ethylene* as the reactant.\n    *   **Method:** Add a *second catalyst system*.\n\n2.  **Translate the Chemical Goal:** Using only ethylene to create a branched polymer means the second catalyst must perform a specific reaction: it must convert some of the ethylene monomer into short-chain alpha-olefins (e.g., 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene). This process is called oligomerization. These newly formed alpha-olefins then act as co-monomers with the remaining ethylene, and the first catalyst incorporates them into the growing polymer chain, creating the branches. The most common and industrially desirable comonomer for this is 1-hexene, which is formed by the *trimerization* (linking of three molecules) of ethylene.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Statement based on Chemical Principles and Industrial Practice:**\n\n    *   **Statement A: \"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.\"**\n        *   **Reasoning:** This refers to tandem or dual-catalyst systems in a single reactor. The concept is to have one catalyst produce the comonomer (e.g., 1-hexene from ethylene) and a second catalyst copolymerize that comononer with ethylene to make Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE). This is a well-known and highly advanced industrial strategy. Companies like Univation Technologies (a joint venture of Dow and ExxonMobil) and Chevron Phillips Chemical have developed and commercialized technologies along these lines to improve efficiency and produce specific polymer grades.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This statement is factually correct.\n\n    *   **Statement B: \"Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\"**\n        *   **Reasoning:** The key reaction is ethylene oligomerization. Noble metals (like Palladium, Pd) and other late transition metals often considered in the same cost category for bulk processes (like Nickel, Ni) are indeed very effective catalysts for ethylene oligomerization and polymerization. For example, the Shell Higher Olefin Process (SHOP) uses a nickel catalyst to produce a broad distribution of alpha-olefins. However, noble metals are extremely expensive compared to the transition metals typically used for bulk polyethylene production (like Titanium, Zirconium, and Chromium). Their high cost makes them economically unfeasible for producing a commodity plastic like polyethylene on a massive scale.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This statement is factually correct.\n\n    *   **Statement C: \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\"**\n        *   **Reasoning:** Group VIa in the old nomenclature is Group 6 in the modern IUPAC system. This group contains Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W). **Chromium-based catalysts are the cornerstone of industrial ethylene trimerization to 1-hexene.** This technology, pioneered by companies like Chevron Phillips, is a major industrial route to produce the 1-hexene comonomer needed for LLDPE. The senior scientist is providing a direct and accurate clue to the specific type of catalyst system that would achieve the desired outcome.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This statement is factually correct and highly relevant to the problem.\n\n    *   **Statement D: \"Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.\"**\n        *   **Reasoning:** The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization (e.g., trimerization) of ethylene. The statement claims that aluminum-based activators (co-catalysts) like methylaluminoxane (MAO), triethylaluminum (TEA), or other alkylaluminums do not work for this step. This is definitively incorrect. The highly active and selective chromium-based trimerization catalysts (mentioned in the reasoning for C) almost universally *require* an aluminum-based activator. The activator plays a crucial role in generating the catalytically active species from the catalyst precursor.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This statement is factually incorrect.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Select the Best Answer:**\n    *   We have identified that statements A, B, and C are correct, while D is incorrect. In a single-best-answer question, we must determine which correct statement is the *most* relevant and addresses the core of the scientific inquiry.\n    *   The scientist is asking for technical advice on *how* to achieve a specific chemical transformation.\n    *   Statement A is a commercial fact.\n    *   Statement B describes a non-viable, expensive alternative.\n    *   Statement C describes the specific, viable, and industrially proven *chemical system* to solve the problem.\n    *   Therefore, statement C is the most direct and useful piece of technical advice among the options. It points the scientist toward the key chemical technology used for this purpose.\n\n<<<C>>>"
