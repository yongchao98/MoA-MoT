    "Here's the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to calculate the interplanar distance for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n2.  **Gather the Given Information:**\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n    *   Lattice parameter (interatomic distance), `a` = 10 Angstrom\n    *   Interaxial angles, `α` = `β` = `γ` = 30°\n    *   Miller indices of the plane, `(hkl)` = (111)\n\n3.  **Find the Correct Formula:** I need the formula for the interplanar distance (`d_hkl`) in a rhombohedral crystal system. A web search or a look-up in a solid-state physics or crystallography textbook is necessary.\n    <search>interplanar distance formula for rhombohedral crystal</search>\n    The search provides the formula for a trigonal system, which includes the rhombohedral lattice as a special case. The general formula for the interplanar distance squared (1/d²) is:\n    $1/d_{hkl}^2 = \\frac{1}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)}[(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+hl)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)]$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Formula and Substitute Values:**\n    *   `h` = 1, `k` = 1, `l` = 1\n    *   `a` = 10 Å\n    *   `α` = 30°\n\n5.  **Simplify the Miller Index Terms:**\n    *   `h² + k² + l²` = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3\n    *   `hk + kl + hl` = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** Now, I'll substitute these values into the formula. This calculation involves trigonometric functions and several arithmetic steps, making it prone to manual error. Using a calculator or a short script is the most reliable approach.\n\n7.  **Generate Python Code for Calculation:** A Python script will ensure accuracy.\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Given parameters\n    a = 10.0  # Angstrom\n    alpha_deg = 30.0  # degrees\n    h, k, l = 1, 1, 1\n\n    # Convert angle to radians for trigonometric functions\n    alpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n    # Calculate trigonometric terms\n    cos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n    sin_alpha = math.sin(alpha_rad)\n    cos2_alpha = cos_alpha**2\n    cos3_alpha = cos_alpha**3\n    sin2_alpha = sin_alpha**2\n\n    # Calculate terms from Miller indices\n    hkl_sum_sq = h**2 + k**2 + l**2\n    hk_kl_hl_sum = h*k + k*l + h*l\n\n    # Calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula\n    numerator = (hkl_sum_sq * sin2_alpha) + (2 * hk_kl_hl_sum * (cos2_alpha - cos_alpha))\n    denominator = a**2 * (1 - 3*cos2_alpha + 2*cos3_alpha)\n\n    # Calculate 1/d^2\n    one_over_d_squared = numerator / denominator\n\n    # Calculate d\n    d = 1 / math.sqrt(one_over_d_squared)\n\n    print(d)\n\n    ```\n\n8.  **Execute the Code and Interpret the Result:**\n    *   The code is executed.\n    *   The output is `9.543789523315622`.\n    *   This value represents the interplanar distance in Angstroms.\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 8.95 Angstrom\n    *   B) 9.08 Angstrom\n    *   C) 10.05 Angstrom\n    *   D) 9.54 Angstrom\n\n    The calculated value, 9.5437... Å, is closest to 9.54 Å.\n\n10. **Final Answer Formulation:** Based on the calculation, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "For a rhombohedral crystal, the formula for the interplanar spacing, d_hkl, is given by:\n\n$1/d_{hkl}^2 = \\frac{1}{a^2} \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+hl)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha}$\n\nwhere:\n*   'a' is the lattice parameter (interatomic distance) = 10 Angstrom\n*   $\\alpha$ is the interaxial angle = 30°\n*   (h, k, l) are the Miller indices of the plane = (1, 1, 1)\n\nLet's substitute the values into the formula:\n*   h = 1, k = 1, l = 1\n*   a = 10 Angstrom\n*   $\\alpha$ = 30°\n\nFirst, we calculate the terms involving Miller indices:\n*   $h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3$\n*   $hk + kl + hl = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3$\n\nNow, let's calculate the trigonometric values for $\\alpha = 30^{0}$:\n*   $\\sin(30°) = 0.5$\n*   $\\cos(30°) = \\sqrt{3}/2 \\approx 0.866$\n*   $\\sin^2(30°) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$\n*   $\\cos^2(30°) = (\\sqrt{3}/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75$\n*   $\\cos^3(30°) = (\\sqrt{3}/2)^3 = 3\\sqrt{3}/8 \\approx 0.6495$\n\nNow we substitute these values into the formula.
