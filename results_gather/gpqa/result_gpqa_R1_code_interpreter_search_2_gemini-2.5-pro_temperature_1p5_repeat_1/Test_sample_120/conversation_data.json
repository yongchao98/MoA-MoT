    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let's break down this name:\n        *   `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a six-membered carbon ring (cyclohexane) fused to a three-membered epoxide ring. The epoxide oxygen is designated as position 7, and it bridges carbons 1 and 6. This is essentially a substituted cyclohexene oxide.\n        *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups are attached to carbons 1, 3, and 4 of the bicyclic system.\n        *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` defines the absolute stereochemistry at the chiral centers.\n    *   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. In this reaction, it acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, effectively a methyl carbanion (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is the ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. The prompt provides two key rules for this reaction:\n        1.  The nucleophile (the alkyl group from the cuprate) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n        2.  The attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the carbon that is attacked (this is a characteristic of an Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n\n2.  **Identify the Site of Nucleophilic Attack:**\n    *   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6. We need to determine which one is less sterically hindered.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom (which is not explicitly written in the name but is implied by valence). It is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Comparing a carbon substituted with a methyl group to one substituted with a hydrogen atom, C6 is significantly less sterically hindered.\n    *   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. The nucleophile attacks C6 from the side opposite to the C6-O bond. According to the provided rules, this causes an **inversion of configuration** at C6.\n        *   The initial configuration at C6 is given as **6S**.\n        *   After inversion, the configuration at this carbon in the product will be **R**.\n    *   **Fate of C1:** The C6-O bond breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming an alkoxide. The C1-O bond also breaks as part of the ring opening, and this oxygen, now bonded only to C1, becomes the alkoxide. After an aqueous workup step (which is standard and implicit in such problems), the alkoxide is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   Since no bonds to the chiral center C1 are broken during this process (only the C1-O bond breaks, but the tetrahedral geometry of C1 is defined by its other four substituents), the configuration at C1 is **retained**.\n        *   The initial configuration at C1 is given as **1R**.\n        *   Therefore, the configuration at this carbon in the product will remain **R**.\n    *   **Fate of C3 and C4:** The chiral centers at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction at all. Their configurations will be **retained**.\n        *   Initial configurations: **3R** and **4R**.\n        *   Final configurations: **3R** and **4R**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Product Structure and Name:**\n    *   The reaction opens the epoxide ring to form a cyclohexanol derivative.\n    *   The -OH group is located at the original C1 position.\n    *   A new methyl group is attached to the original C6 position.\n    *   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are still present.\n    *   The resulting product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n5.  **Assign IUPAC Numbering and Stereochemistry to the Product:**\n    *   According to IUPAC rules for cyclohexanols, the carbon bearing the -OH group is assigned as C1.\n    *   So, the old C1 becomes the **new C1**. It has an -OH group and a methyl group. Its configuration is **1R**.\n    *   We number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from old C1 towards old C6 gives substituents at 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   The old C6 becomes the **new C2**. It has the newly added methyl group. Its configuration inverted from S to **R**. So, it is **2R**.\n    *   The old C4 becomes the **new C4**. It has a methyl group. Its configuration is retained as **R**. So, it is **4R**.\n    *   The old C3 becomes the **new C5**. It has a methyl group. Its configuration is retained as **R**. So, it is **5R**.\n\n6.  **Final Product Name and Comparison with Options:**\n    *   Putting it all together, the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n    *   Let's compare this with the given options:\n        *   A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect stereochemistry at C2)\n        *   B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect structure, gem-dimethyl group)\n        *   C) **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** (This matches our derived result)\n        *   D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect structure and stereochemistry)\n\nThe correct product is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
