    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a stochastic process that follows an exponential law. The key characteristic of this process is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The decay rate is constant.\n\n**2. Define the Mathematical Model**\n\nLet T be the random variable representing the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time *t* (the survival probability) is given by:\nP(T > t) = S(t) = e^(-λt)\n\nwhere λ is the decay constant.\n\nThe probability that the atom *has* decayed by time *t* is:\nP(T ≤ t) = F(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**3. Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\nP(T ≤ 100) = 0.32\n\nUsing the formula from step 2:\n1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\nTo solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n-100λ = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nWe don't need to calculate the numerical value of λ just yet. We can keep it in this exact form.\n\n**4. Formulate the Question as a Conditional Probability**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\nLet's denote the time of decay as T. The question asks for:\nP(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)\n= P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)\n\nThe formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B).\nHere:\n*   Event A: T ≤ 200 (The atom decays before 200 minutes)\n*   Event B: T > 50 (The atom survives past 50 minutes)\n\nThe event \"A and B\" is that the atom survives past 50 minutes AND decays before 200 minutes. This is simply 50 < T ≤ 200.\n\nSo, the probability is:\nP(50 < T ≤ 200) / P(T > 50)\n\n**5. Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nBecause radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its future decay probability. The probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the problem simplifies to calculating:\nP(T ≤ 150)\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ).\nWe already found that λ = -ln(0.68) / 100.\nLet's substitute this into the equation:\n\nProbability = 1 - e^(-150 * [-ln(0.68) / 100])\nProbability = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))\n\nUsing the logarithm property x * ln(y) = ln(y^x):\nProbability = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))\n\nSince e^(ln(x)) = x:\nProbability = 1 - 0.68^1.5\n\nNow, we perform the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes,\n# given the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n# Decay follows an exponential distribution, which is memoryless.\n# This means the probability of decay in a future interval depends only on the length\n# of that interval, not on the past.\n\n# We are given P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32\n# Let S(t) = P(survival > t) = exp(-lambda * t)\n# P(decay in t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - exp(-lambda * t)\n\n# From the given data:\n# 1 - exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.32\n# exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68\n\n# The question asks for P(decay between t=50 and t=200 | survived past t=50).\n# Due to the memoryless property, this is equivalent to P(decay in 150 min for a new atom).\n# P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150)\n\n# We know that exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68.\n# We can write exp(-lambda * 150) as:\n# exp(-lambda * 100 * 1.5) = (exp(-lambda * 100))^1.5\n# = 0.68^1.5\n\n# So, the final probability is 1 - 0.68^1.5\n\nresult = 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\n\nprint(f\"{result:.4f}\")\n```\n\nThe probability is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%.\nLooking at the options:\nA) 48%\nB) 52%\nC) 44%\nD) 40%\n\nThe closest answer is 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The thinking process to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical process and its mathematical model.**\n    The problem describes radioactive decay, a random process. The key feature of radioactive decay is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed without decaying. This memoryless property is characteristic of the exponential probability distribution.\n\n2.  **Define the survival function.**\n    Let T be the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom survives for a time greater than *t* is given by the survival function S(t):\n    S(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)\n    where λ is the decay constant, a parameter that defines how quickly the decay occurs.\n\n3.  **Define the decay probability function.**\n    The probability that the atom decays *within* a time *t* is the complement of the survival function:\n    F(t) = P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n4.  **Use the given information to find the decay constant (λ).**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32\n    Using the formula from step 3:\n    1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n    Subtracting 1 from both sides and multiplying by -1:\n    e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\n    e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\n    We could solve for λ by taking the natural logarithm, but it's often easier to work with the term e^(-λ) directly.\n\n5.  **Formulate the question in terms of probability.**\n    We are asked to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, *given* that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    This is a conditional probability:\n    P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)\n\n6.  **Apply the memoryless property.**\n    Because the process is memoryless, the condition that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not affect its future decay probability. Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n    So, the problem simplifies to calculating:\n    P(T ≤ 150)\n\n7.  **Calculate the required probability.**\n    We need to find P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ).\n    From step 4, we know that e^(-100λ) = 0.68.\n    We can manipulate the expression e^(-150λ) to use our known value:\n    e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n    Now, substitute the value we found:\n    e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n    The final probability is:\n    P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\n8.  **Compute the numerical value.**\n    I will use the Python code interpreter to get an exact value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We want to calculate 1 - (0.68)^1.5\nprobability = 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\n\n# The result is the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n# We print it as a percentage.\nprint(f\"The probability is {probability:.4f}\")\n\n```\nThe code output of `0.4393` corresponds to a probability of 43.93%.\n\n9.  **Match the result to the given options.**\n    A) 48%\n    B) 52%\n    C) 44%\n    D) 40%\n\n    Our calculated probability of 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The final answer is **C)**.\n\nHere's the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Model the Decay:** Radioactive decay is a memoryless process that follows an exponential distribution. The probability that an atom has not decayed by time *t* (its survival probability) is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where λ is the decay constant. The probability that it *has* decayed is `P(decay) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Find the Decay Constant (λ):** We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32% (0.32).\n    *   `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** The question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes. Because decay is memoryless, the past 50 minutes of survival do not influence the future. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the probability that a new atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Probability:** We need to calculate `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n    *   We can rewrite the exponential term using the value we found in step 2:\n        `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    *   Substitute the known value:\n        `(0.68)^1.5`\n    *   The final probability is:\n        `1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Compute the Value:**\n    *   `0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   `1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\nThis probability, 0.4393, is equivalent to 43.93%. The closest option is **44%**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
