    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   The first step is to calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n*   For C9H11NO2: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds).\n*   The remaining degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) is most likely a double bond, probably a carbonyl group (C=O), which is consistent with the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is in the range for an ester, especially one that is conjugated with a benzene ring. A typical aromatic ester C=O stretch appears around 1715-1730 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Summary from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) group and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, appearing as a triplet. A triplet means it's adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2), typically a CH₂ group. The chemical shift and multiplicity strongly suggest a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, appearing as a quartet. A quartet means it's adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3), which is the -CH₃ group seen at 1.20 ppm. The downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-CO-O-**CH₂**-). These two signals (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm) confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester** moiety (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. Broad signals in this region are typical for exchangeable protons, like those on an amine (-NH₂) or alcohol (-OH). Combined with the IR data, this confirms the primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region and integrate to a total of 4 protons. The pattern of two doublets indicates a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted)** benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield (deshielded), meaning they are next to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt). The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield (shielded), meaning they are next to an electron-donating group (the amine, -NH₂).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the spectral analysis, the compound has the following pieces:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂) attached to the ring.\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the ring.\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a *meta*-substituted (1,3) ring and an amide, not an ester. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ethyl group is part of a propionate (CH₃CH₂COO-), not an ethyl ester. The NMR signal for the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a 1,4-disubstituted ring with an -NH₂ group and an ethyl ester group. It perfectly matches all the IR and NMR data.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H peak in the IR and have only 1 proton for the amide in the NMR. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence from the molecular formula, IR spectroscopy, and ¹H NMR spectroscopy all points conclusively to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
