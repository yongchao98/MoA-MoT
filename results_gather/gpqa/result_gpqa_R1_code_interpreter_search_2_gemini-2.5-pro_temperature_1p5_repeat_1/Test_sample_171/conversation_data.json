    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in stellar photospheres, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship between the population of different energy states and temperature in such a system is governed by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state `j` (N_j) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state `i` (N_i) is given by:\n\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\n    Where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the respective energy levels.\n    *   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels, which we can call `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the absolute temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to both stars:**\n    Let's denote the ratio `N_j / N_i` as `R`.\n\n    *   For `star_1` with temperature `T_1`:\n        R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\n    *   For `star_2` with temperature `T_2`:\n        R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    The term `(g_j / g_i)` and the energy difference `ΔE` are properties of the specific iron transition and are the same for both stars.\n\n4.  **Use the condition given in the problem:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This means the ratio of populations is twice as large for star_1 as it is for star_2.\n\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the condition:**\n\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * { (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] }\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The statistical weight ratio `(g_j / g_i)` cancels out from both sides.\n\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n7.  **Isolate the temperature terms:** To deal with the exponentials, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides.\n\n    ln{exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]} = ln{2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]}\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`, we get:\n\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln{exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]}\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n8.  **Rearrange the equation to match the options:** Let's solve for `ln(2)`.\n\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n9.  **Use the given numerical values:** The problem gives the energy difference `ΔE` as approximately `1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant, `k`, has a value of approximately `1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`. These values are intentionally chosen so that their ratio is 1.\n\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\n    Substituting this into our equation:\n\n    ln(2) = 1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n10. **Final algebraic simplification:** Combine the fractions on the right side by finding a common denominator (`T1*T2`).\n\n    ln(2) = (T_1 / (T1*T2)) - (T_2 / (T1*T2))\n    ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)\n\n11. **Conclusion:** The derived equation `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
