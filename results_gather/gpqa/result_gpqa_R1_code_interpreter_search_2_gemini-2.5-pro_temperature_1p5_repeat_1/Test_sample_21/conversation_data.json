    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the First Blank (Thermodynamics):**\n    *   The first part of the statement deals with thermodynamics: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n    *   Thermodynamic strength of an oxidant is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° indicates a stronger oxidizing agent, meaning it has a greater tendency to be reduced.\n    *   We need to compare the reduction potential of oxygen in a basic solution to its potential in an acidic solution.\n    *   The half-reaction for the reduction of oxygen in an **acidic** solution is:\n        O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +1.23 V.\n    *   The half-reaction for the reduction of oxygen in a **basic** solution is:\n        O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +0.40 V.\n    *   Comparing the two potentials: +0.40 V (basic) is significantly less positive than +1.23 V (acidic).\n    *   Since the reduction potential is lower in a basic solution, oxygen has a lesser tendency to be reduced in basic conditions compared to acidic conditions.\n    *   Therefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Second Blank (Kinetics):**\n    *   The second part of the statement deals with kinetics: \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n    *   Kinetics refers to the rate of a reaction. A reaction can be thermodynamically favorable (spontaneous) but proceed very slowly if it has a high activation energy.\n    *   The reduction of diatomic oxygen (O₂) to water (H₂O) involves breaking the strong O=O double bond and transferring four electrons. This process is inherently complex and has a high activation energy barrier, making the reaction kinetically slow under most conditions. This is often referred to as the reaction having a high \"overpotential\".\n    *   Comparing acidic and basic solutions, the kinetics of oxygen reduction are generally found to be more sluggish (i.e., **slower**) in acidic media than in alkaline (basic) media, especially on non-precious metal catalysts. This kinetic limitation in acidic environments is a major challenge in the development of technologies like proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells.\n    *   Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\n3.  **Combine the Findings:**\n    *   For the first blank, the correct word is **weaker**.\n    *   For the second blank, the correct word is **slower**.\n    *   The correct combination is **weaker – slower**.\n\n4.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) stronger – slower\n    *   B) stronger – faster\n    *   C) weaker – faster\n    *   D) weaker - slower\n\n    The combination \"weaker - slower\" corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
