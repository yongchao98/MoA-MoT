    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means there must be an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an atom to transition from a state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$ to $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle$ by emitting or absorbing a single photon, the following selection rules must be obeyed:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n$, can be any integer, but for decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so $n_f < n_i$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules for each of the two transitions.\n\n    *   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Initial state: $(n_i, l_i, m_i) = (3, 0, 0)$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$, which implies $l' = 1$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, which implies $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   Applying $n' < n_i$: $n' < 3$. The most common decay is to the next lowest possible principal quantum number, so let's check if $n'=2$ is possible.\n        *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are of the form $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, where $m' \\in \\{ -1, 0, 1 \\}$. These are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   Final state: $(n_f, l_f, m_f) = (1, 0, 0)$.\n        *   Let's check if the transitions from our potential intermediate states are allowed.\n        *   Intermediate state: $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This implies that for the transition to be allowed, $m'$ must be $0, 1,$ or $-1$. All our determined intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$ satisfy this condition.\n        *   Applying $n_f < n'$: $1 < 2$. This is also satisfied.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on Transition Routes:** There are three possible routes for the two-dipole transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n        1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    All the routes listed in the options are valid possibilities.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) for each route:**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This is interpreted as the branching ratio for that cascade path. The probability of a specific path is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. This means there is no preferred direction in space.\n        *   The three possible final states of the first decay, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in the non-relativistic theory and only differ by their spatial orientation (they are related by rotations).\n        *   Because the initial state has no preferred orientation, the probability of decaying into any of these three states must be equal.\n        *   Since these are the only possible decay channels from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state (decay to $n=1$ is forbidden as $l=0 \\to l=0$), the sum of their probabilities must be 1.\n        *   Therefore, the probability of transitioning to any specific $m'$ state is $1/3$.\n        *   Branching Ratio (BR) for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n        *   BR for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n        *   BR for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), it will decay to a lower energy level.\n        *   The only state with energy lower than $n=2$ is the $n=1$ state, which is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The transition $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed by the selection rules.\n        *   Therefore, any atom that reaches the 2p level will decay to the 1s ground state with a probability of 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability for a specific route:**\n        *   The total probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is:\n            $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n    *   B) Route is incomplete, and probability $\\frac{2}{3}$ is incorrect.\n    *   C) Route is valid, but probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ is incorrect.\n    *   D) Route is valid, but probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ is incorrect.\n\nThus, option A correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
