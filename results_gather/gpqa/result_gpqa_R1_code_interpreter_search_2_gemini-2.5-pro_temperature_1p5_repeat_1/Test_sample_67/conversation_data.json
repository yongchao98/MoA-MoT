    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State (t < 0):** A spin-1/2 particle is in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the +Z direction. Its magnetic moment `μ = γS` is aligned with the field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state, which is the spin-up eigenstate along the Z-axis. We denote this state vector at t=0 as `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n*   **Sudden Change (t = 0):** The magnetic field is instantaneously switched from the +Z direction to the +Y direction, with the same magnitude `B`. Due to the sudden nature of this change, the state of the particle does not have time to change. Therefore, immediately after the switch (at t=0+), the state is still `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n*   **Time Evolution (t > 0):** For `t > 0`, the particle's state will evolve according to the new Hamiltonian. The new magnetic field is `B_new = B * ŷ` (where `ŷ` is the unit vector in the Y direction).\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian and its Eigenstates\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `H = -μ ⋅ B`.\nGiven `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator, the new Hamiltonian is:\n`H = -γS ⋅ (Bŷ) = -γB * S_y`\n\nTo understand the time evolution, we need to find the eigenstates and eigenvalues of this new Hamiltonian `H`. The eigenstates of `H` are the same as the eigenstates of the spin operator `S_y`.\n\n*   The eigenvalues of `S_y` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n*   Let's denote the corresponding eigenstates as `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n*   The energy eigenvalues of `H` are:\n    *   `E_+y` (corresponding to `|+y>`) = `-γB * (eigenvalue of S_y)` = `-γB * (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`.\n    *   `E_-y` (corresponding to `|-y>`) = `-γB * (eigenvalue of S_y)` = `-γB * (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`.\n\nThe energy difference between these two states is:\n`ΔE = E_-y - E_+y = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the System\n\nAny quantum state that is a superposition of different energy eigenstates will evolve in time. The frequency of oscillation for the expectation value of an observable that couples these states is determined by the energy difference `ΔE`.\n\nAccording to the principles of quantum mechanics, the characteristic angular frequency `ω` of the system's time evolution is given by the Bohr frequency relation:\n`ΔE = ħω`\n\nSolving for `ω`:\n`ω = ΔE / ħ = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`\n\nThis frequency `ω` is the frequency at which the system precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of any spin component not aligned with the new field (i.e., `S_x` and `S_z`) will oscillate at this Larmor frequency.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Expectation Value (Detailed Check)\n\nWe want to find the oscillation frequency of `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)>`. Let's verify this result by explicitly calculating `<S_z(t)>`.\n\n1.  **Express initial state in the new energy basis:**\n    The initial state is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. The energy eigenstates are `|+y>` and `|-y>`. In the standard Z-basis where `|+z> = (1, 0)` and `|-z> = (0, 1)`, the Y-eigenstates are:\n    `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n    `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    Inverting these relations, we find:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n\n2.  **Evolve the state in time:**\n    The state at time `t` is given by applying the time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = (1/√2) * [ U(t)|+y> + U(t)|-y> ]`\n    Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are energy eigenstates:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(-iE_+y*t/ħ)|+y> + e^(-iE_-y*t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n    Substituting the energy values: `E_+y/ħ = -γB/2` and `E_-y/ħ = γB/2`.\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(iγBt/2)|+y> + e^(-iγBt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value `<S_z(t)>`:**\n    We use the matrix representation in the Z-basis:\n    `S_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    The state vector `|ψ(t)>` can be written by substituting the Z-basis representations of `|+y>` and `|-y>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + e^(-iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [ (e^(iγBt/2) + e^(-iγBt/2))|+z> + i(e^(iγBt/2) - e^(-iγBt/2))|-z> ]`\n    Using Euler's formulas `cos(θ) = (e^(iθ)+e^(-iθ))/2` and `sin(θ) = (e^(iθ)-e^(-iθ))/(2i)`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n    Now, we calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]^T`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * (γBt/2)) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    The expression for the oscillation is `cos(ωt)` where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nBoth the general argument based on energy difference and the explicit calculation yield the same oscillation frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
