    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca^2+]) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex solution.\n\n**1. Understand the equilibrium reaction:**\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by the reaction:\nCa^2+ + EDTA^4- <=> [Ca(EDTA)]^2-\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this formation is the formation constant, Kf (given as KCa-EDTA):\nKf = [[Ca(EDTA)]^2-] / ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-]) = 5 x 10^10\n\nHowever, we are starting with the complex and want to find how much of it dissociates. So, it's easier to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation:\n[Ca(EDTA)]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation, Kd, is the inverse of the formation constant, Kf:\nKd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5 x 10^10) = 2 x 10^-11\n\n**2. Set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):**\n\nLet 'x' be the concentration of Ca^2+ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| [Ca(EDTA)]^2-       | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca^2+               | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA^4-             | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n*(Note: The assumption of \"ideal pH\" means we can treat all dissociated EDTA as EDTA^4- without worrying about protonation effects.)*\n\n**3. Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation:**\n\nKd = ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-]) / [[Ca(EDTA)]^2-]\n2 x 10^-11 = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n2 x 10^-11 = x^2 / (0.02 - x)\n\n**4. Simplify and solve for x:**\n\nBecause the dissociation constant (Kd) is extremely small, the amount of complex that dissociates (x) will be very small compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the approximation:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n2 x 10^-11 ≈ x^2 / 0.02\n\nNow, solve for x:\nx^2 ≈ (2 x 10^-11) * 0.02\nx^2 ≈ 4 x 10^-13\nx = √(4 x 10^-13)\n\nTo solve this without a calculator, we can rewrite it as:\nx = √(40 x 10^-14)\nx = (√40) * 10^-7\n\nWe know that √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, so √40 is approximately 6.3.\nx ≈ 6.3 x 10^-7 M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+], is x.\n[Ca^2+] ≈ 6.3 x 10^-7 M.\n\nLet's use a Python script for a more precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nC_complex_initial = 0.02  # Initial concentration of Ca-EDTA complex in M\nKf = 5e10                 # Formation constant\n\n# The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant\nKd = 1 / Kf\n\n# We need to solve the quadratic equation: Kd = x^2 / (C_initial - x)\n# Rearranging gives: x^2 + Kd*x - Kd*C_initial = 0\n# This is a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0\na = 1\nb = Kd\nc = -Kd * C_complex_initial\n\n# Solve using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\nx = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a) # We only take the positive root as concentration cannot be negative\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\nThe python code solves the quadratic equation x^2 + Kd*x - Kd*C_initial = 0 for x, which represents the concentration of Ca^2+ ions at equilibrium. The calculation confirms the result obtained from the approximation. The value is approximately 6.32 x 10^-7 M, which matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca^2+], in a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Define the chemical equilibrium:**\nThe Ca-EDTA complex, [Ca(EDTA)]^2-, is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. The dissociation reaction is:\n[Ca(EDTA)]^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n\n**2. Determine the Equilibrium Constant:**\nWe are given the formation constant (Kf), which is for the reverse reaction:\nCa^2+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ [Ca(EDTA)]^2-\nKf = 5 x 10^10\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (Kd) is the inverse of the formation constant:\nKd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5 x 10^10) = 2 x 10^-11\n\n**3. Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) Table:**\nLet 'x' be the concentration of Ca^2+ that forms at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction, the concentration of EDTA^4- will also be 'x', and the concentration of the complex will decrease by 'x'.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| [Ca(EDTA)]^2-       | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca^2+               | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA^4-             | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n**4. Write the Expression for the Dissociation Constant (Kd):**\nKd = ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-]) / [[Ca(EDTA)]^2-]\n2 x 10^-11 = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n**5. Solve for x:**\nBecause the dissociation constant (Kd = 2 x 10^-11) is very small, the amount of the complex that dissociates, 'x', will be negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). We can therefore simplify the denominator:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nNow the equation becomes:\n2 x 10^-11 ≈ x^2 / 0.02\n\nSolve for x^2:\nx^2 ≈ (2 x 10^-11) * 0.02\nx^2 ≈ 4 x 10^-13\n\nSolve for x, which is the concentration of Ca^2+:\nx = √(4 x 10^-13)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M\n\nThe calculation from the Python script confirms this result precisely as 6.32e-07 M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2.0x10^-2 M\nB) 6.3x10^-7 M\nC) 1.0x10^-2 M\nD) 5.0x10^-3 M\n\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M.\n\n<<<B>>>"
