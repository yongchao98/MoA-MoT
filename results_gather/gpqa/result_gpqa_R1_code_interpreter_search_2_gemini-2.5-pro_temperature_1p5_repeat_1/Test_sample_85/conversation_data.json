    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. Let's break down this name to understand its structure:\n*   **-2H-pyran-2-one**: This indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (pyran) with a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position. This is a lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **4-ethyl-**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   The IUPAC numbering for this ring system starts with the ring oxygen as position 1, and the carbonyl carbon as position 2.\n*   The carbon at position 4, which is bonded to an ethyl group, a hydrogen, and two other carbon atoms in the ring, is a **chiral center**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction Pathways**\n\nBoth reactions start with a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid and end with the same lactone structure, differing only in stereochemistry ((R) vs. (S)). The key to solving this problem lies in the **chemoselectivity** of the two different reducing agents.\n\nThe starting materials proposed in the options are all `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n*   A **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) at one end.\n*   An **isobutyl ester** (-COO-isobutyl) at the other end.\nIt also has a chiral center at C3.\nStructure: `HOOC(C1)-CH2(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH2(C4)-C(=O)(C5)O-iBu`\n\n**Reaction A: `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-lactone`**\n\n*   **Reagent**: LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is selective for reducing esters (and aldehydes/ketones) but does **not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction**: LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 will remain unchanged.\n*   **Intermediate**: After the reduction and acidic workup (H+), the intermediate is `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`, which is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Lactonization**: This hydroxy-acid will undergo intramolecular esterification under the acidic conditions of the workup. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The reduction and cyclization reactions occur at C1 and C5, which are not the chiral center (C3). The stereochemistry at C3 is preserved during the reaction. In the final lactone product, the chiral C3 of the starting material becomes the chiral C4. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Reaction B: `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-lactone`**\n\n*   **Reagent**: BH3 (Borane) is a reducing agent that is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It is much less reactive towards esters.\n*   **Reaction**: BH3 will reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The isobutyl ester group at C5 will remain unchanged.\n*   **Intermediate**: After the reduction and workup, the intermediate is `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`, which is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n*   **Lactonization**: This hydroxy-ester will undergo intramolecular transesterification under the acidic conditions. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carbonyl of the ester, displacing isobutanol (`i-BuOH`) to form the same six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: As in Reaction A, the chemistry happens away from the chiral center (C3). The configuration at C3 is preserved, and it becomes the chiral C4 in the final lactone product.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
