    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The operator $P_z$ in matrix form is:\n        $P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for uncertainty:**\n    The uncertainty of an operator $A$, denoted as $\\Delta A$, is given by the formula:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    In our case, we need to find the uncertainty of $P_z$, so the formula is:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    The expectation value of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is calculated as $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$.\n    First, we need the bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$, which is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all elements are real, it's just the transpose:\n    $\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, let's calculate $P_z |\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\cdot (-1/2) + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + (-1) \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Next, we calculate $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2) \\cdot (-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot 0 + (-1/2) \\cdot (1/2) \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 0$\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    First, we need the operator $P_z^2$:\n    $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_z^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\cdot1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0\\cdot0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)\\cdot(-1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, let's calculate $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Next, we calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2) \\cdot (-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot 0 + (-1/2) \\cdot (-1/2) \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    Now we plug the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}}$\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.
