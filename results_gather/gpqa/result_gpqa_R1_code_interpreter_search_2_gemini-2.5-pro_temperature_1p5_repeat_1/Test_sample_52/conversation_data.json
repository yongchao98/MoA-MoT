    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aromatic Ring and its Substitution:**\n    *   The problem states the compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". For a di-substituted benzene ring with 4 protons remaining, having only two signals is characteristic of a symmetrical substitution pattern, most commonly para-substitution (1,4-disubstituted). This means there are 4 aromatic protons in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Identify the Functional Groups from Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **FTIR:** The spectrum shows an \"ester group\". An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms. So, the molecular formula must contain O2.\n    *   **1H NMR - Vinyl Protons:** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a `-CH=CH-CH3` group.\n        *   Let's label the protons: `(Ring)-CHa=CHb-CH3`.\n        *   Proton `Ha` is adjacent to `Hb`, so its signal is split into a doublet.\n        *   Proton `Hb` is adjacent to `Ha` (1 proton) and the `-CH3` group (3 protons). Its signal is split into a doublet by `Ha` and a quartet by the `-CH3` group, resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This confirms one of the substituents on the aromatic ring is a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This substituent has the formula `C3H5`. It contains 2 vinyl protons and one methyl group.\n\n3.  **Identify the Remaining Groups from NMR:**\n    *   **1H NMR - Methyl Groups:** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\". We have already identified one `-CH3` group as part of the propenyl substituent. The second `-CH3` group must be part of the other substituent, which contains the ester group.\n    *   **1H NMR - No Methylene Groups:** The data explicitly states there are \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\". This is a crucial constraint. The second substituent must contain an ester group and a methyl group, but no methylene (`-CH2-`) groups. There are two possibilities for how such a substituent can be attached to the aromatic ring:\n        *   **Possibility A:** A methyl carboxylate group, `-COO-CH3`.\n        *   **Possibility B:** An acetate group, `-O-CO-CH3`.\n        *   Both possibilities are consistent with the data. They both contain an ester, a methyl group, and no methylene group. The chemical formula for both of these substituent fragments is `C2H3O2`.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Now, we sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n        *   Aromatic ring core: `C6H4`\n        *   Propenyl substituent: `C3H5`\n        *   Ester-containing substituent: `C2H3O2`\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2** (from ester)\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Final Verification:**\n    *   Let's check the total hydrogen count from the NMR integration. We have 4 aromatic H + 2 vinyl H + 2 * 3 methyl H = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 hydrogens. This matches our calculated formula.\n    *   Let's check the degree of unsaturation (DBE) for C11H12O2: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6. Our proposed structure contains a benzene ring (DBE=4), one C=C double bond (DBE=1), and one C=O double bond (DBE=1), for a total DBE of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. The structure is consistent with the formula.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated molecular formula is C11H12O2. This matches option C.\n\nA) C11H14O2 (Incorrect H count)\nB) C12H14O2 (Incorrect C and H count)\nC) C11H12O2 (Correct)\nD) C12H12O2 (Incorrect C count)\n\n<<<C>>>"
