    "This problem requires calculating the distribution of cobalt(II) species in a solution with a given concentration of thiocyanate ions. We can determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, using the provided overall stability constants (β).\n\n**1. Identify all species and total concentration:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species in the solution:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n**2. Use stability constants to express species concentrations:**\nThe overall stability constants (βn) are defined as:\n`βn = [[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n)`\n\nWe can rearrange this to express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion `[Co^2+]`, the free thiocyanate ligand `[SCN^-]`, and the stability constants:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\n**3. Express total cobalt concentration in terms of [Co^2+]:**\nSubstitute the expressions from step 2 into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\nFactor out `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**4. Determine the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex:**\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `α2`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n`α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)2]]` and `c(Co)`:\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**5. Calculate the numerical value:**\nWe are given:\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n*   `[SCN^-] = 0.1` M (Since `c(Co)` is much smaller than `[SCN-]`, we can assume the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the total ligand concentration).\n\nLet's calculate the value using Python.\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Ligand concentration\nL = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the numerator (term for the desired complex, [Co(SCN)2])\nnumerator = beta2 * L**2\n\n# Calculate the denominator (sum of all terms representing all species)\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * L) + (beta2 * L**2) + (beta3 * L**3) + (beta4 * L**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nfraction_alpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = fraction_alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n```output\n16.916180326482276\n```\nThe calculation shows that the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 0.169, which is 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem is to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the species:** In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN^-`) to form a series of complexes:\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]^+`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2]` (the species of interest)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]^-`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free `Co^2+` ion and all its complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n2.  **Use the overall stability constants (β):** The overall stability constants relate the concentration of each complex to the concentrations of the free metal ion and the free ligand.\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\n3.  **Define the fraction of the species:** The percentage of a particular species is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `α2`, is given by:\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n4.  **Derive the calculation formula:** Substitute the expressions from step 1 and 2 into the formula for `α2`:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4)`\n\n    We can factor out `[Co^2+]` from the denominator, which then cancels with the numerator:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Plug in the given values:**\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n    *   `[SCN^-] = 0.1` M. (Note: Since the total cobalt concentration `10^-2` M is much less than the thiocyanate concentration `0.1` M, we can assume the concentration of free `SCN^-` is approximately equal to its total concentration).\n\n6.  **Calculate the values for the numerator and denominator:**\n    *   Numerator term for `[Co(SCN)2]`: `β2 * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Denominator terms:\n        *   1 (for free `Co^2+`)\n        *   `β1 * [SCN^-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n        *   `β2 * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n        *   `β3 * [SCN^-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n        *   `β4 * [SCN^-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n    *   Sum of denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n7.  **Calculate the fraction and percentage:**\n    *   `α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n    *   Percentage = `α2 * 100 ≈ 16.916%`\n\nThis value matches the provided option D. The Python code output `16.916180326482287` confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
