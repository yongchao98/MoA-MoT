    "An astronomer is interested in the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2.\n\n**1. Understand the goal:**\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2, which is L1 / L2.\n\n**2. Recall the relevant physics principles:**\n*   **Luminosity of a black body (Stefan-Boltzmann Law):** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a perfect black body, is given by the formula:\n    L = A * σ * T^4\n    where A is the surface area (A = 4πR²), σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature.\n*   **Peak Wavelength (Wien's Displacement Law):** The wavelength at which a black body's radiation is most intense (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its temperature (T):\n    λ_max = b / T\n    where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted. For a source moving with a radial velocity (v_r), the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) by:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c)\n    where 'c' is the speed of light. A positive v_r (moving away) causes a redshift (longer wavelength), and a negative v_r (moving closer) causes a blueshift.\n\n**3. Set up the luminosity ratio:**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\nL1 / L2 = (4πR₁² * σ * T₁⁴) / (4πR₂² * σ * T₂⁴)\nThe constants 4π and σ cancel out, leaving:\nL1 / L2 = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)⁴\n\n**4. Analyze the given information:**\n*   **Radius:** We are given R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁ / R₂) = 1.5.\n*   **Radial Velocity:** v_r1 = 0 km/s and v_r2 = 700 km/s.\n*   **Peak Wavelength:** The problem states that \"the wavelengths at which the stars **appeared brightest**... are the same.\" This refers to the *observed* peak wavelengths. So, λ_obs,max,1 = λ_obs,max,2.\n*   **Mass:** The mass information (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not required for this calculation, which is based on the principles of black body radiation. It serves as extra, non-essential information.\n\n**5. Determine the temperature ratio (T₁ / T₂):**\nThis is the most critical part of the problem. We must relate the observed wavelengths to the stars' true surface temperatures.\n\n*   For Star_1 (v_r1 = 0): The observed wavelength is the same as the emitted wavelength.\n    λ_obs,max,1 = λ_emitted,max,1\n*   For Star_2 (v_r2 = 700 km/s): The light is redshifted due to its radial velocity.\n    λ_obs,max,2 = λ_emitted,max,2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)\n*   Since the observed peak wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,max,1 = λ_obs,max,2):\n    λ_emitted,max,1 = λ_emitted,max,2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)\n*   Now, apply Wien's Law (λ_emitted,max = b/T):\n    b / T₁ = (b / T₂) * (1 + v_r2 / c)\n*   The constant 'b' cancels out. Rearranging the equation to find the temperature ratio gives:\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)\n\n**6. Calculate the final luminosity ratio:**\nSubstitute the known values for the radius ratio and the derived temperature ratio into the luminosity ratio equation:\nL1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)]⁴\n\nNow, we will use a Python script to perform the precise calculation.\n\n**Values for calculation:**\n*   R₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n*   v_r2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n\n```python\n# Given values\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\nvr2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# From the problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same.\n# lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2\n# Since vr1 = 0, lambda_emitted_1 = lambda_obs_1\n# For Star 2, lambda_obs_2 = lambda_emitted_2 * (1 + vr2/c)\n# This leads to: lambda_emitted_1 = lambda_emitted_2 * (1 + vr2/c)\n# Using Wien's Law (lambda_emitted is proportional to 1/T):\n# 1/T1 is proportional to (1/T2) * (1 + vr2/c)\n# This gives the temperature ratio T1/T2:\nT1_over_T2 = 1 / (1 + vr2 / c)\n\n# The luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2**2) * (T1_over_T2**4)\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.229049448937968\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated factor is approximately 2.229, which rounds to 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 (L₁ / L₂).\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, treated as a black body, is given by L = AσT⁴, where A is the surface area (4πR²) and T is the surface temperature. The ratio of luminosities is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁² σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂² σT₂⁴)\n    Simplifying by canceling constants gives:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Use the Given Radius Information:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the radius ratio is:\n    R₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n\n4.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T₁ / T₂):** This is the key step involving Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the wavelength at which the star emits most of its light (λ_emitted_max). So, T ∝ 1 / λ_emitted_max. This means the temperature ratio T₁ / T₂ is equal to the inverse of the emitted peak wavelength ratio, λ_emitted_max,2 / λ_emitted_max,1.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths (λ_obs_max) are the same for both stars. We must relate this observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength for each star.\n        *   For Star_1, the radial velocity (v₁) is 0, so there is no Doppler shift. The observed wavelength is the same as the emitted wavelength: λ_obs_max,1 = λ_emitted_max,1.\n        *   For Star_2, the radial velocity (v₂) is 700 km/s. This velocity causes a redshift, meaning the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength. The relationship is given by λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), where c is the speed of light. Therefore, λ_obs_max,2 = λ_emitted_max,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   **Connecting the Pieces:** Since the observed wavelengths are equal (λ_obs_max,1 = λ_obs_max,2):\n        λ_emitted_max,1 = λ_emitted_max,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n    *   **Solving for Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute this into the temperature ratio equation:\n        T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted_max,2 / λ_emitted_max,1\n        T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted_max,2 / [λ_emitted_max,2 * (1 + v₂/c)]\n        T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the values:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    *   c ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 700,000 / 299,792,458)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * [1 / (1.002335)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * (0.99767)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n    The calculated value is approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>"
