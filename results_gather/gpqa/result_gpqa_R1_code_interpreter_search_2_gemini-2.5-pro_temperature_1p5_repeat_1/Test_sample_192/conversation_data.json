    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (let's call it N) in a specific region of the sky is related to the parallax (plx) by the following proportionality:\n    N ∝ 1 / plx⁵\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:**\n    Parallax is a method used to measure the distance to nearby stars. The parallax angle (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r) to the star. The relationship is:\n    plx = 1 / r\n    Therefore, r = 1 / plx.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    We can substitute the relationship between parallax and distance into the given equation for the number of stars.\n    Since N ∝ 1 / plx⁵ and plx = 1 / r, we can write:\n    N ∝ 1 / (1/r)⁵\n    N ∝ 1 / (1/r⁵)\n    N ∝ r⁵\n\n    This tells us that the total (or cumulative) number of stars observed up to a distance 'r' is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Distance:**\n    The question asks for how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*. This is equivalent to finding the number of stars in a thin shell at a distance 'r' with a small thickness 'dr'. Mathematically, this is the derivative of the total number of stars (N) with respect to the distance (r), which is dN/dr.\n\n    We have the proportionality N ∝ r⁵. We can write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, k:\n    N = k * r⁵\n\n    Now, we differentiate N with respect to r:\n    dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (d/dx(xⁿ) = nxⁿ⁻¹), we get:\n    dN/dr = k * 5 * r⁵⁻¹\n    dN/dr = 5k * r⁴\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Proportionality:**\n    From the result dN/dr = 5k * r⁴, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance (dN/dr) is directly proportional to r⁴.\n    dN/dr ∝ r⁴\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived relationship dN/dr ∝ r⁴ matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
