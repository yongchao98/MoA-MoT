    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Define Earth's Density:** I'll start by defining a variable for the density of Earth, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. This will serve as our baseline for comparison.\n2.  **Analyze Option a:** A planet with Earth's mass and radius will, by definition, have Earth's density.\n3.  **Analyze Option b:** The density for this planet is explicitly given as approximately 5.5 g/cm³, which is essentially the same as Earth's density.\n4.  **Analyze Option c:** For a planet with the same composition (rocky) as Earth but higher mass, its own gravity will compress its material more tightly. This gravitational compression leads to a higher overall density. I will estimate this density using the physical relationship where density scales with the fourth root of mass (ρ ∝ M^(1/4)) for rocky planets.\n5.  **Analyze Option d:** Similarly, a planet with the same composition but less mass will be less compressed by gravity. Its density will therefore be lower than Earth's. I will use the same mass-density relationship to estimate its density.\n6.  **Compare and Conclude:** I will compare the calculated densities for all four options and determine which one is the highest. Finally, I will print the corresponding letter.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_highest_density_planet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and compares the densities of four exoplanet scenarios to find the highest.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Earth's density in g/cm^3 is our baseline\n    earth_density = 5.51\n\n    # --- Analysis of each option ---\n\n    # a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.\n    # By definition, its density is the same as Earth's.\n    density_a = earth_density\n    print(f\"a) Density of an Earth-like planet: {density_a:.2f} g/cm^3\")\n\n    # b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.\n    # The density is given in the problem.\n    density_b = 5.5\n    print(f\"b) Density of the 2-Earth-mass planet: {density_b:.2f} g/cm^3\")\n\n    # c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive.\n    # For rocky planets, increased mass leads to gravitational compression, increasing density.\n    # The approximate relation is Density is proportional to Mass^(1/4).\n    mass_ratio_c = 5.0\n    density_c = earth_density * (mass_ratio_c ** 0.25)\n    print(f\"c) Estimated density of the 5-Earth-mass planet: {density_c:.2f} g/cm^3\")\n\n    # d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.\n    # Less mass means less gravitational compression and thus lower density.\n    mass_ratio_d = 0.5\n    density_d = earth_density * (mass_ratio_d ** 0.25)\n    print(f\"d) Estimated density of the 0.5-Earth-mass planet: {density_d:.2f} g/cm^3\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # --- Comparison ---\n    densities = {\n        'A': density_a,\n        'B': density_b,\n        'C': density_c,\n        'D': density_d\n    }\n\n    # Find the letter corresponding to the maximum density\n    highest_density_choice = max(densities, key=densities.get)\n    \n    print(f\"Comparing the densities, the planet from option C ({density_c:.2f} g/cm^3) is the most dense.\")\n    print(f\"The correct option is: {highest_density_choice}\")\n\nfind_highest_density_planet()\n<<<C>>>"
