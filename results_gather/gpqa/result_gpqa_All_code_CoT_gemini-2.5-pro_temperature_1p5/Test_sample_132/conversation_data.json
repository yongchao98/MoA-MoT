    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-):\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles** of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O from their given masses and molar masses. These will give us the moles of the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-) and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-), respectively.\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations** of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- by dividing the moles of each by the total volume of the solution in liters (200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L).\n3.  **Recognize the buffer system.** The solution contains a weak acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). The equilibrium governing this buffer is related to the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka2.\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration ([H+])** in the buffer solution using the expression for Ka2: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]. We can rearrange this to solve for [H+].\n5.  **Use the third dissociation constant (Ka3)** to find the orthophosphate (PO4^3-) concentration. The relevant equilibrium is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-. The expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].\n6.  **Solve for [PO4^3-]** by rearranging the Ka3 expression. We will use the [H+] calculated in step 4 and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-] from step 2, as its further dissociation is negligible.\n7.  **Compare the final calculated concentration** to the given options to select the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000.0  # Volume in Liters\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the moles of each component\n# Moles of KH2PO4 correspond to moles of H2PO4-\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\n# Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O correspond to moles of HPO4^2-\nmoles_HPO4 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the initial molar concentrations\n# Concentration of H2PO4-\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / volume_L\n# Concentration of HPO4^2-\nconc_HPO4 = moles_HPO4 / volume_L\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+]\nconc_PO4 = (Ka3 * conc_HPO4) / conc_H_plus\n\n# Step 6: Print the result and the options for comparison\nprint(f\"The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is: {conc_PO4:.2e} M\")\nprint(\"\\nOptions:\")\nprint(f\"A) 6.24x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"B) 2.81x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"C) 5.48x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"D) 3.97x10^-7 M\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option A.\")\n\n<<<A>>>\n```"
