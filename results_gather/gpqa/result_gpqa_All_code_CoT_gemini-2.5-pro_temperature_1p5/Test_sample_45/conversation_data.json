    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of products:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n*   **Reactant:** Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. \"Racemic\" means we have a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n*   **Reaction:** Olefin metathesis, catalyzed by Grubbs catalyst. Since only one type of alkene is present, this will be a self-metathesis reaction.\n\n**2. Determine the General Product Structure:**\n*   The self-metathesis of a terminal alkene of the structure `R-CH=CH2` yields a symmetrical internal alkene `R-CH=CH-R` and ethene (`CH2=CH2`).\n*   The problem asks to exclude ethene from the count.\n*   In our case, the `R` group is the chiral sec-butyl group, `CH(CH3)CH2CH3`.\n*   The product is `(CH3CH2CH(CH3))-CH=CH-(CH(CH3)CH2CH3)`, which is named **3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry:**\n*   The product molecule, 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, has two chiral centers (at carbons 3 and 6) and a double bond (at carbon 4) that can have E (trans) or Z (cis) geometry.\n*   Because the starting material is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) alkenes, we must consider the products from all possible pairings:\n    *   **(R)-alkene + (R)-alkene:** This reaction creates a product with two (R) chiral centers: (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This molecule can exist as two different geometric isomers: the (E) and (Z) forms. That's **2 products**.\n    *   **(S)-alkene + (S)-alkene:** This reaction creates a product with two (S) chiral centers: (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This also exists as (E) and (Z) isomers. These are the enantiomers of the (3R, 6R) products. That's **2 more distinct products**.\n    *   **(R)-alkene + (S)-alkene:** This \"cross-metathesis\" reaction creates a product with one (R) and one (S) chiral center: (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Because the groups attached to the chiral centers are identical, this is a meso compound (achiral despite having chiral centers). This meso compound can also exist as two different geometric isomers (which are diastereomers of each other): the (E) and (Z) forms. That's **2 more distinct products**.\n\n**4. Sum the Products:**\n*   Adding up all the unique, isolable stereoisomers gives a total of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 products.\n\n```python\ndef solve_metathesis_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the stereochemical outcome of the self-metathesis\n    of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: The reaction is the self-metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene.\")\n    print(\"The starting material is a mix of (R)-alkene and (S)-alkene.\")\n    print(\"Step 2: The product, excluding ethene, is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\")\n    print(\"This product has two chiral centers (C3, C6) and a central double bond (C4).\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Analyze the products from all possible reaction pairings:\")\n    \n    # Pairing 1: (R) + (R)\n    r_r_products = 2\n    print(f\"- Pairing (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene gives the (3R,6R) product, which has E and Z isomers.
