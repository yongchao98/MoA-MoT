    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Features:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This means we start with a benzene ring (C₆H₄) that has two groups attached to it.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons. This means the two substituents together must contain 2 additional carbons (8 total - 6 ring = 2).\n    *   **\"FTIR...carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR...aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, F, I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's call it 'X'.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is `-X` (a halogen). This substituent has 0 carbons.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons AND the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's consider possible structures for a two-carbon substituent with a carbonyl group:\n        *   **Acetyl group (`-COCH₃`)**: This has two carbons and a carbonyl. This is a very common and stable substituent.\n        *   **2-Oxoethyl group (`-CH₂CHO`)**: This also has two carbons and a carbonyl (an aldehyde). This is another possibility.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Full Molecular Structures and Predict their ¹H NMR Spectra:**\n\n    *   **Possibility 1: Acetyl group + Halogen on a benzene ring.**\n        *   Structure: Haloacetophenone. The most symmetrical arrangement is `para` (1,4-substitution), which would be **4-halo-acetophenone**.\n        *   Let's predict the ¹H NMR for 4-halo-acetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃):\n            *   **Aromatic Protons**: The `para` substitution creates symmetry. There will be two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. This gives a characteristic pattern of two doublets (`2H, d` and `2H, d`). The protons closer to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be downfield (higher ppm, ~7.8-8.0 ppm). The protons closer to the halogen will be slightly more upfield (~7.5-7.7 ppm).\n            *   **Acetyl Protons**: The methyl group (`-CH₃`) is next to a carbonyl carbon (which has no protons), so it will be a singlet (`s`). It will have an integration of `3H`. Its chemical shift is typically around 2.0-2.6 ppm.\n        *   **Predicted Spectrum:** ~7.8 ppm (2H, d), ~7.6 ppm (2H, d), ~2.3 ppm (3H, s).\n\n    *   **Possibility 2: 2-Oxoethyl group + Halogen on a benzene ring.**\n        *   Structure: Halo-phenylacetaldehyde. Again, let's assume a `para` substitution for symmetry: **4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde**.\n        *   Let's predict the ¹H NMR for 4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO):\n            *   **Aldehyde Proton (`-CHO`)**: This gives a very characteristic signal far downfield (~9.5-10.0 ppm). It's a singlet (`s`) or a triplet (`t`) and integrates to `1H`.\n            *   **Methylene Protons (`-CH₂-`)**: These are adjacent to the aldehyde proton, so they should be split into a doublet (`d`). They integrate to `2H`. The chemical shift is typically around 3.5-4.0 ppm.\n            *   **Aromatic Protons**: Similar to the first case, we'd expect two doublets (`2H, d` and `2H, d`) in the aromatic region (~7.0-7.8 ppm).\n        *   **Predicted Spectrum:** ~9.9 ppm (1H, s/t), ~7.8 ppm (2H, d), ~7.6 ppm (2H, d), ~3.7 ppm (2H, d).\n\n4.  **Compare Predicted Spectra with the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum matches our prediction for 4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde. It has the aldehyde proton at 9.9 ppm, the methylene protons at 3.7 ppm, and the para-substituted aromatic pattern. However, the multiplicity for the `-CH₂CHO` group is given as two singlets (`s`), which is unusual. They should typically couple to form a doublet and a triplet. While not impossible (if the coupling constant is near zero), it is anomalous.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum is a **perfect textbook match** for our prediction for 4-halo-acetophenone. All chemical shifts, integrations, and splitting patterns (multiplicity) are exactly as expected.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This is incorrect. It lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This is incorrect. The integration for the aromatic proton (1H) does not fit a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have 4H).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both A and B correspond to structures that fit the initial description. However, the spectrum in option B is a classic, unambiguous match for 4-halo-acetophenone. The spectrum in option A represents 4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde but with questionable multiplicity. In chemical identification problems, the perfect fit is the intended correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the problem to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n    1.  **Compound requirements:**\n        - Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (benzene with 2 groups).\n        - 8 carbon atoms total.\n        - Contains a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n        - Contains an aromatic-halogen bond (halogen on the ring).\n\n    2.  **Structure Deduction:**\n        - The ring has 6 carbons. The substituents must have 2 carbons.\n        - One substituent is a halogen (-X). It has 0 carbons.\n        - The other substituent must have 2 carbons and the C=O group.\n        - The most common and stable group matching this is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n        - This leads to the structure halo-acetophenone.\n        - The most symmetrical isomer is para-halo-acetophenone (4-halo-acetophenone).\n\n    3.  **Predicted 1H NMR for 4-halo-acetophenone:**\n        - Aromatic region: A para-substituted ring gives two doublets, each for 2 protons. The protons near the electron-withdrawing acetyl group are deshielded (~7.8 ppm). The protons near the halogen are slightly less deshielded (~7.6 ppm). So: (2H, d) and (2H, d).\n        - Acetyl methyl group (-CH3): It's next to a carbon with no protons, so it's a singlet. It has 3 protons. Chemical shift ~2.3 ppm. So: (3H, s).\n        - Total predicted spectrum: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s).\n\n    4.  **Evaluate Options:**\n        - A) 1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). The 9.9 ppm peak indicates an aldehyde. This would correspond to 4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde. However, the multiplicity of the CH2 (s) and CHO (s) is unusual; they should be a doublet and a triplet.\n        - B) 1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). This is a perfect match for the predicted spectrum of 4-halo-acetophenone.\n        - C) No aromatic protons (~7-8 ppm). Incorrect.\n        - D) Aromatic region does not match a di-substituted ring. Incorrect.\n\n    5.  **Conclusion:** Option B provides a perfect, unambiguous match for a plausible structure (4-halo-acetophenone) that fits all the given criteria.\n    \"\"\"\n    correct_choice = 'B'\n    explanation = \"Option B perfectly matches the expected 1H NMR spectrum for 4-halo-acetophenone. This structure has 8 carbons (6 in the ring, 2 in the acetyl group), a carbonyl group, a di-substituted aromatic ring, and an aromatic-halogen bond.
