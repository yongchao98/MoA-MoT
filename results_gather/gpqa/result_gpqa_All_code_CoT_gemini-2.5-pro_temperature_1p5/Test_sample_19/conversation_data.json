    "My plan is to analyze the core concept of the \"impulse approximation\" and then evaluate each of the four statements to see if it is a necessary component of this approximation.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Impulse Approximation:** The core idea is that a high-energy probe interacting with a nucleus interacts with just one nucleon at a time, and that this nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle during the very brief moment of interaction. The binding forces and the presence of other nucleons are considered negligible for the interaction itself.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Statement 1:** \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\" This is the fundamental starting point. If the interaction involved pairs or groups of nucleons (known as two-body currents or meson-exchange currents), it would by definition not be an impulse approximation. So, this statement is essential.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Statement 2:** \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\" This deals with what happens after the interaction. It implies that the particle struck (or the outgoing probe) does not re-interact with other nucleons on its way out of the nucleus (no final-state interactions). This is necessary to treat the particle's final state as if it were a free particle, which is a key part of the simplest form of the impulse approximation. So, this statement is essential.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Statement 3:** \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\" This concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, not its behavior as a complete particle within the nucleus. The impulse approximation can be used regardless of whether the nucleon's internal quark structure is treated as relativistic or non-relativistic. Therefore, this is not a required assumption for the impulse approximation.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Statement 4:** \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\" A \"free\" nucleon has no binding forces. The impulse approximation assumes the energy transferred in the interaction is so large that the nucleon's binding energy (which is much smaller) can be ignored during the instantaneous collision. This is a crucial part of treating the nucleon as free. So, this statement is essential.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The necessary assumptions are 1, 2, and 4. I will write a Python code to identify the option that matches this set of assumptions and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_impulse_approximation_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the assumptions of the impulse approximation in nuclear physics\n    to determine the correct combination from a multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The impulse approximation assumes that during a high-energy interaction:\n    # 1.
