    "Here is a breakdown of the plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 to Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where T_star is the star's temperature, R_star is the star's radius, 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and A is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** Since T_star, R_star, and the albedo (A) are the same for both planets, these terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1/a1)^(1/2) / (1/a2)^(1/2) = (a2/a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n5.  **Determine the Semi-Major Axis Ratio (a2/a1):** We are not given the semi-major axes directly. We must derive them from the provided radial velocity (RV) data.\n    *   The maximum radial velocity of the star (the RV semi-amplitude, K) is proportional to the Doppler shift (Δλ): K = c * (Δλ / λ₀). Therefore, the ratio K1/K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ1/Δλ2.\n    *   For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by: K = M_planet * sqrt(G / (a * M_star)).\n    *   By rearranging this formula for 'a', we get: a = G * M_planet² / (K² * M_star).\n    *   Now, we can find the ratio a2/a1:\n        a2 / a1 = [G * M_p2² / (K2² * M_star)] / [G * M_p1² / (K1² * M_star)]\n    *   The gravitational constant G and the star's mass M_star cancel out, leaving:\n        a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n    *   Since K1/K2 = Δλ1/Δλ2, the final expression for the semi-major axis ratio is:\n        a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)²\n\n6.  **Calculate and Conclude:** Substitute the given values for planet masses and Doppler shifts into the equation to find a2/a1, then take the square root to find the temperature ratio and match it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Data ---\n# Planet 1\nm_p1 = 7.0  # Earth masses\nd_lambda1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\n\n# Planet 2\nm_p2 = 5.0  # Earth masses\nd_lambda2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# --- Step-by-step Calculation ---\n\n# 1. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 simplifies to sqrt(a2 / a1),\n#    where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\n# 2. The ratio of the semi-major axes a2 / a1 can be found from the radial velocity data.\n#    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n#    where M_p is the planet mass and K is the radial velocity semi-amplitude.\n\n# 3. The ratio of radial velocity semi-amplitudes K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio\n#    of the observed Doppler shifts d_lambda1 / d_lambda2.\n\n# 4.

Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1).\na2_over_a1 = mass_ratio_squared * doppler_shift_ratio_squared\n\n# 7. Calculate the final equilibrium temperature ratio (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a2_over_a1)\n\n# --- Final Answer ---\nprint(f\"The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (Planet1 / Planet2) is approximately: {temp_ratio:.2f}\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option B.\")\n\n# --- Available choices ---\nprint(\"A) ~ 0.98\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 0.53\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 1.05\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 1.30\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
