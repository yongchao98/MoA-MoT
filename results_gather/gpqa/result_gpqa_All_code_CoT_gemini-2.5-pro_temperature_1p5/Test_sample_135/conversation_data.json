    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem:** We need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`. The field is given by `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, and the volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:** The Divergence Theorem is a powerful tool in vector calculus that relates a volume integral to a surface integral. It states:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    Here, `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V`. In our case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`. This theorem allows us to solve the problem by calculating the flux of the vector field through the surface of the sphere, which is often simpler.\n\n3.  **Handle the Singularity:** It's important to note that the field `f(r) = 1/r^2 * r_hat` is singular (undefined) at the origin (`r=0`). A direct calculation of the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` would give 0 for any `r > 0`, which would incorrectly lead to an integral of 0. The Divergence Theorem correctly handles this kind of singularity, which physically represents a source at the origin (like a point charge in electrostatics).\n\n4.  **Set up the Surface Integral:**\n    *   On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equals `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   The differential surface area element for a sphere in spherical coordinates is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r_hat`. The vector `r_hat` points radially outward, which is the correct orientation for the theorem.\n    *   Next, we compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n        `f ⋅ dS = ((1/R^2) * r_hat) ⋅ (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r_hat)`\n    *   Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1` and the `R^2` terms cancel, the expression simplifies to `sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Integral:** We now need to integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `Integral = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n6.  **Use Python for Verification:** We can use Python's symbolic math library, `sympy`, to compute this definite double integral and find the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import sin, pi, integrate\n\n# This script calculates the answer using the Divergence Theorem.\n# The volume integral of the divergence is converted into a surface integral (flux)\n# of the field through the sphere's surface.\n\n# Define the symbols for spherical coordinates theta and phi\ntheta, phi = sympy.symbols('theta phi')\n\n# The integrand for the surface integral is derived from f . dS.\n# f = (1/R^2) * r_hat on the surface.\n# dS = R^2 * sin(theta) * d(theta) * d(phi) * r_hat.\n# The dot product f . dS simplifies to sin(theta) * d(theta) * d(phi).\nintegrand = sin(theta)\n\n# We need to integrate over the full surface of the sphere:\n# theta goes from 0 to pi\n# phi goes from 0 to 2*pi\n\n# First, integrate with respect to theta from 0 to pi\nintegral_over_theta = integrate(integrand, (theta, 0, pi))\n\n# Then, integrate the result with respect to phi from 0 to 2*pi\nfinal_result = integrate(integral_over_theta, (phi, 0, 2*pi))\n\n# Print the result of the calculation and the choices\nprint(\"The volume integral of the divergence of the field evaluates to:\")\nprint(final_result)\nprint(\"\\nThe choices are:\")\nprint(\"A) 4 * pi\")\nprint(\"B) 1\")\nprint(\"C) 4/3 * pi * R\")\nprint(\"D) 0\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing the result to the choices, the most appropriate answer is A.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
