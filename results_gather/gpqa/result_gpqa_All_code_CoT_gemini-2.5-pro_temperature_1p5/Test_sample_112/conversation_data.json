    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data**: I will analyze the information provided from each characterization technique (FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry) to deduce the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n    *   **FTIR**: A broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ combined with a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is highly indicative of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   **¹H NMR**: The mention of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond (an alkene).\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry**: A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of the [COOH]⁺ fragment, further strengthening the evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n2.  **Determine the Required Structural Features**: Based on the analysis, the unknown compound must be an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This means it must contain:\n    *   Two oxygen atoms (from the -COOH group).\n    *   A degree of unsaturation of at least 2 (one for the C=O in the acid and one for the C=C alkene).\n3.  **Evaluate the Options**: I will calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each of the given molecular formulas using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. I will then check which formula has a DoU of 2 and contains two oxygen atoms.\n4.  **Final Selection**: I will select the formula that matches all the criteria derived from the spectral data.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectroscopic data to identify the correct molecular formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the provided spectroscopic data.\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # FTIR Analysis\n    print(\"FTIR Analysis:\")\n    print(\"- A very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests an O-H stretch, characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\"- A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ indicates a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\"- A peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ points to a C=C (alkene) stretch.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion from FTIR: The compound likely contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C) group.\\n\")\n\n    # 1H NMR Analysis\n    print(\"1H NMR Analysis:\")\n    print(\"- The presence of vinyl-hydrogens confirms a C=C double bond.\\n\")\n\n    # Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n    print(\"Mass Spectrometry Analysis:\")\n    print(\"- A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic signature for the [COOH]+ fragment, strongly supporting the presence of a carboxylic acid.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determining the required structural features.\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Based on the data, the molecule is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\"- It must contain 2 oxygen atoms (for the -COOH group).\")\n    print(\"- It must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2 (one for the C=O and one for the C=C).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Evaluating the candidate formulas.\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------\")\n    # Candidates dictionary: formula -> (Carbons, Hydrogens, Oxygens)\n    candidates = {\n        \"A) C6H12O2\": (6, 12, 2),\n        \"B) C6H10O2\": (6, 10, 2),\n        \"C) C6H10O\": (6, 10, 1),\n        \"D) C6H12O\": (6, 12, 1)\n    }\n\n    final_choice = None\n    final_letter = None\n\n    for choice, (C, H, O) in candidates.items():\n        # Calculate Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n        # DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 (Oxygen and Halogens don't affect the formula this way)\n        dou = C - (H / 2) + 1\n        print(f\"Analyzing {choice}:\")\n        print(f\"  - Number of Oxygens: {O}\")\n        print(f\"  - Calculated DoU: {int(dou)}\")\n\n        # Check if it meets the criteria\n        if O == 2 and dou == 2:\n            print(\"  - Verdict: MATCH.
