    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a four-step organic synthesis reaction sequence. I will break down each reaction to determine the structure and stereochemistry of the intermediate products, ultimately leading to the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Step 1:** Start with (R)-(+)-Limonene and determine the product of selective hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H2/Pd/C. This involves identifying the more and less substituted double bonds.\n2.  **Analyze Step 2:** Take the product from Step 1 and determine the product of epoxidation with m-CPBA. This requires considering the stereoselectivity of the reaction, which is guided by the existing stereocenter and bulky groups.\n3.  **Analyze Step 3:** Take the epoxide from Step 2 and determine the product of nucleophilic ring-opening with sodium methoxide. This requires knowing the rules for regioselectivity (where the nucleophile attacks) and stereospecificity (the stereochemical outcome) of epoxide opening under basic conditions.\n4.  **Analyze Step 4:** Take the product from Step 3 and determine the product of esterification with propanoic acid/DCC/DMAP. This is a standard ester formation that doesn't affect the stereocenters of the alcohol.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Compare the final derived structure and stereochemistry of Product 4 with the given multiple-choice options to find the correct match.\n\nThis entire logical process will be encapsulated in a Python script that prints the step-by-step reasoning and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a four-step reaction sequence starting from (R)-(+)-Limonene\n    to determine the structure of the final product and select the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step-by-step Analysis ---\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\")\n\n    # Step 1: Hydrogenation\n    step1_explanation = (\n        \"1.
