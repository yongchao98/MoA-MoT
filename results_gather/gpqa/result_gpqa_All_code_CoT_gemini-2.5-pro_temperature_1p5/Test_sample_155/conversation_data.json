    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatographic separations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reactant:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetrical trans-alkene.\n    *   **Reagents:** First, mCPBA for epoxidation, then aqueous acid (H3O+) for epoxide opening. This two-step sequence results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The anti-addition of two hydroxyl groups to a *trans*-alkene results in the formation of a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Product 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reactant:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetrical cis-alkene.\n    *   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1, resulting in an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The anti-addition of two hydroxyl groups to a *cis*-alkene results in the formation of a *racemic mixture* (an equal mixture of two enantiomers).\n    *   **Product 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n3.  **Combine the Products:**\n    *   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are enantiomers of each other.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Standard (Achiral) HPLC Chromatogram:**\n    *   A standard HPLC column separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   However, it can separate diastereomers, which have different physical properties.\n    *   Therefore, the two enantiomers ((4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol) will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair, will have different properties and will elute at a different time, creating a second peak.\n    *   **Result:** 2 peaks are observed.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This allows it to interact differently with each enantiomer, leading to their separation.\n    *   It will also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n    *   **Result:** 3 peaks are observed (one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis shows there will be **2 peaks in standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in chiral HPLC**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\n# Let's codify the reasoning to determine the correct option.\n\n# Step 1: Define the products from each reaction based on stereochemistry rules.\n# Reaction 1: (E)-alkene + anti-dihydroxylation -> meso compound\n# Reaction 2: (Z)-alkene + anti-dihydroxylation -> racemic mixture (a pair of enantiomers)\nproduct_mixture = {\n    \"meso_compound\": 1,\n    \"enantiomer_pair\": 1 \n}\n# The mixture contains one meso compound and one pair of enantiomers.\n# Total stereoisomers = 1 (meso) + 2 (enantiomers) = 3.\n\n# Step 2: Calculate peaks for standard (achiral) HPLC.\n# Standard HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n# The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair.\n# The two enantiomers in the pair are not separable.\nnum_peaks_standard = 0\n# Peak for the meso compound\nnum_peaks_standard += product_mixture[\"meso_compound\"]\n# Peak for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair\nnum_peaks_standard += product_mixture[\"enantiomer_pair\"]\n\n# Step 3: Calculate peaks for chiral HPLC.\n# Chiral HPLC separates all stereoisomers (diastereomers and enantiomers).\nnum_peaks_chiral = 0\n# Peak for the meso compound\nnum_peaks_chiral += product_mixture[\"meso_compound\"]\n# Peaks for the separable enantiomers (a pair gives 2 peaks)\nnum_peaks_chiral += 2 * product_mixture[\"enantiomer_pair\"]\n\n# Step 4: Compare the results to the options and select the correct one.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": (2, 3), # (standard peaks, chiral peaks)\n    \"B\": (2, 2),\n    \"C\": (4, 4),\n    \"D\": (3, 4)\n}\n\nfinal_answer = \"\"\nfor choice, (std_peaks, chi_peaks) in options.items():\n    if num_peaks_standard == std_peaks and num_peaks_chiral == chi_peaks:\n        final_answer = choice\n        break\n\nprint(\"Analysis of the HPLC experiment:\")\nprint(f\"Number of peaks in standard (achiral) HPLC: {num_peaks_standard}\")\nprint(f\"Number of peaks in chiral HPLC: {num_peaks_chiral}\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {final_answer}.\")\nprint(\"Final Answer is: A\")\n\n# <<<A>>> will be extracted from this part of the script\nprint(\"<<<A>>>\")\n```"
