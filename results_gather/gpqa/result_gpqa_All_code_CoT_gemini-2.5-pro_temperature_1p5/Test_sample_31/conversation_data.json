    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus (X):** The problem states that nucleus X is Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. The atomic number of Lithium is 3, meaning it has 3 protons. Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^6$Li), composed of 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n2.  **Calculate the Rest Energy ($E_0$):** The rest energy of the nucleus is the sum of the rest energies of its constituent particles. In this type of problem, it is common to approximate the nucleus's rest energy by summing the rest energies of its protons and neutrons, ignoring the binding energy for simplicity.\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor is a function of the particle's speed and is calculated using the formula:\n    $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    Given that the speed `v` is `0.96c`, the ratio `v/c` is `0.96`.\n4.  **Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E):** The total energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the equation:\n    $E = \\gamma \\times E_0$\n5.  **Final Output:** The Python code will perform these calculations and print the resulting total energy in GeV, which can then be compared to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define physical constants and nucleus properties.\n# The nucleus is Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n# The atomic number of Li is 3, so it has 3 protons.\nnum_protons = 3\nnum_neutrons = 3\n\n# Rest energy of a proton in GeV (Giga-electron Volts).\nproton_rest_energy_GeV = 0.938272\n# Rest energy of a neutron in GeV.\nneutron_rest_energy_GeV = 0.939565\n\n# The speed of the nucleus is given as 0.96c.\nv_over_c = 0.96\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total rest energy (E0) of the nucleus.\n# E0 = (number of protons * proton rest energy) + (number of neutrons * neutron rest energy)\nnucleus_rest_energy_GeV = (num_protons * proton_rest_energy_GeV) + (num_neutrons * neutron_rest_energy_GeV)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) for the given speed.\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\nlorentz_factor = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total relativistic energy (E) of the nucleus.\n# E = gamma * E0\ntotal_energy_GeV = lorentz_factor * nucleus_rest_energy_GeV\n\n# Step 5: Print the final answer with the required precision (1e-4).\n# The calculated value is closest to option D.\nprint(\"Choices:\")\nprint(\"A) 21.419 GeV\")\nprint(\"B) 18.475 GeV\")\nprint(\"C) 23.069 GeV\")\nprint(\"D) 20.132 GeV\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"Nucleus: Lithium-6 ({num_protons} protons, {num_neutrons} neutrons)\")\nprint(f\"Rest Energy (E0): {nucleus_rest_energy_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Lorentz Factor (gamma) for v=0.96c: {lorentz_factor:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated Total Relativistic Energy (E): {total_energy_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated energy is approximately 20.1200 GeV, which corresponds to choice D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
