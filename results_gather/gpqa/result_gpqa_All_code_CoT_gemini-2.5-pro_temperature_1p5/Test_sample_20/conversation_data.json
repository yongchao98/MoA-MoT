    "My plan is to solve this chemistry problem by breaking it down into two parts, as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n1.  I will analyze the structure of **benzoquinone**. Tautomerism (specifically keto-enol tautomerism) requires an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on an sp3-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. In 1,4-benzoquinone, all carbon atoms in the ring are sp2-hybridized (part of C=C or C=O double bonds), so there are no alpha-hydrogens. Thus, it cannot undergo tautomerism.\n2.  I will analyze the structure of **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp3-hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens, situated between two carbonyl groups, making them highly acidic and mobile. This compound readily tautomerizes to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol.\n3.  Conclusion for Part 1: **Benzoquinone** is the compound (A) that does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n1.  I will analyze the structure of **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to a hydrogen (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). Since these four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, and the molecule will exhibit optical isomerism.\n2.  I will analyze the structure of **dimethyl fumarate**. This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. It is planar and has a center of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n3.  Conclusion for Part 2: **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound (B) that shows optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, compound A is benzoquinone and compound B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. This matches option D. I will now write the Python code to reflect this logic and print the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze tautomerism for the first pair of compounds.\n# Tautomerism requires an alpha-hydrogen (an H on an sp3 carbon next to a C=O).\n# Benzoquinone has only sp2 carbons in its ring, so no alpha-hydrogens.\n# Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has CH2 groups between the C=O groups, which contain alpha-hydrogens.\ncompound_that_does_not_show_tautomerism = \"benzoquinone\"\n\n# Step 2: Analyze optical isomerism for the second pair of compounds.\n# Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (a carbon with four different attached groups).\n# Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The central carbon is bonded to -H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3. These are four different groups, so it is chiral.\n# Dimethyl fumarate: This molecule is planar and symmetric; it has no chiral centers.\ncompound_that_shows_optical_isomerism = \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\"\n\n# Step 3: Define the options given in the problem.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": {\"A\": \"benzoquinone\", \"B\": \"dimethyl fumarate\"},\n    \"B\": {\"A\": \"cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione\", \"B\": \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\"},\n    \"C\": {\"A\": \"cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione\", \"B\": \"dimethyl fumarate\"},\n    \"D\": {\"A\": \"benzoquinone\", \"B\": \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\"}\n}\n\n# Step 4: Find the correct option based on our analysis.\ncorrect_option = None\nfor option_letter, compounds in options.items():\n    if compounds[\"A\"] == compound_that_does_not_show_tautomerism and \\\n       compounds[\"B\"] == compound_that_shows_optical_isomerism:\n        correct_option = option_letter\n        break\n\n# Step 5: Print the final answer.\nprint(\"Analysis:\")\nprint(f\"Compound A (does not show tautomerism): {compound_that_does_not_show_tautomerism}\")\nprint(f\"Compound B (shows optical isomerism): {compound_that_shows_optical_isomerism}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nfor letter, compounds in options.items():\n    print(f\"Option {letter}: A = {compounds['A']}, B = {compounds['B']}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe correct option is {correct_option}.\")\nprint(f'<<<{correct_option}>>>')\n```"
