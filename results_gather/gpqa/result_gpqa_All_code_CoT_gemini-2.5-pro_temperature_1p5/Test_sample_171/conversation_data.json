    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical law:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in stellar photospheres, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The distribution of atoms across different energy levels in such a system is described by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Boltzmann equation for an excitation ratio:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (`N_excited`) to the number in the ground state (`N_ground`) is given by:\n    `N_excited / N_ground = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `ΔE` is the energy difference between the excited and ground states, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, `T` is the temperature, and `g` represents the statistical weight (degeneracy) of the energy levels. Let's call this ratio `R`.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to both stars:**\n    *   For star 1 (temperature T_1), the excitation ratio is: `R_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`, where `C` is the constant ratio of degeneracies `g_excited / g_ground`.\n    *   For star 2 (temperature T_2), the excitation ratio is: `R_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`.\n\n4.  **Use the condition given in the problem:** We are told that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2, meaning `R_1 = 2 * R_2`.\n    `C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n    The constant `C` cancels out on both sides:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n5.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To solve this equation, we can take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n    Now, rearrange the equation to solve for `ln(2)`:\n    `ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ((T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2))`\n\n6.  **Use the provided numerical values:** The problem gives `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The value of the Boltzmann constant `k` is `1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`. This means the ratio `ΔE / k` is very close to 1. By substituting `ΔE / k ≈ 1`, the equation simplifies to:\n    `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:** This final derived equation matches option D.\n\n```python\n# The physical principle used is the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population of\n# atomic energy levels to temperature for a system in thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\n# Let R_1 be the excitation ratio for star 1 (temperature T_1)\n# and R_2 be the excitation ratio for star 2 (temperature T_2).\n# Let ΔE be the energy difference and k be the Boltzmann constant.\n# From the Boltzmann equation, we have:\n# R_1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n# R_2 is proportional to exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n# The problem states that R_1 = 2 * R_2.\n# So, exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n# Taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides gives:\n# -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n# Rearranging the equation to solve for ln(2):\n# ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\n# Factoring out the common term (ΔE / k):\n# ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n# Combining the fractions:\n# ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) )\n\n# The problem provides that ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J.\n# The Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n# Therefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) is approximately 1.\n# Substituting this value into the equation, we get the final relation.\nfinal_relation = \"ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)\"\n\n# The given options are:\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\",\n    \"B\": \"ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\",\n    \"C\": \"ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\",\n    \"D\": \"ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\"\n}\n\nprint(\"The derived relation is:\", final_relation)\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options provided:\")\nfor choice, equation in options.items():\n    print(f\"{choice}) {equation}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe correct option is D.\")\n\n# Final Answer Selection\ncorrect_choice = 'D'\nprint(f\"The correct equation is option {correct_choice}.\")\nprint(\"<<<D>>>\")\n```"
