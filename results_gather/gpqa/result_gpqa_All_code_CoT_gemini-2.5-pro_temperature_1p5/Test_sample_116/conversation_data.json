    "To determine which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism, we need to analyze each structure for chirality. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The most common sources of chirality are chiral centers (an atom bonded to four different groups) and axial chirality (as seen in some substituted biphenyls).\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   This is a biphenyl molecule. The bulky substituents (nitro and carboxylate groups) at all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') cause severe steric hindrance.\n    *   This hindrance prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   Because rotation is locked, the rings are held in a non-planar arrangement. The molecule lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3`.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since the central carbon is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **Analyze benzophenone:**\n    *   The structure is `C6H5-CO-C6H5`.\n    *   This molecule is symmetrical. It has a C2 axis of rotation passing through the carbonyl group. It also has a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Analyze dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the trans-isomer of an alkene: `CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3`.\n    *   The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion.\n    *   Because it possesses elements of symmetry, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral. This corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\ndef solve_isomerism_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four organic compounds to determine which exhibit optical isomerism\n    and prints the correct multiple-choice option.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    compounds = {\n        1: {\n            \"name\": \"dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\",\n            \"analysis\": \"This is a substituted biphenyl.
