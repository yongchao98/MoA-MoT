    "Here is a step-by-step plan to identify Compound X:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra:** First, I will carefully interpret the provided ¹H and ¹³C NMR data to determine the exact chemical structure of the product formed in the reaction.\n2.  **Evaluate Starting Material Options:** Next, I will examine the structures of the four possible starting materials (Compound X options A, B, C, D) and verify their molecular formulas.\n3.  **Hypothesize the Chemical Reaction:** The reaction is a thermal rearrangement of an epoxide catalyzed by a non-nucleophilic base (DABCO). I will consider plausible rearrangement mechanisms for vinyloxiranes under these conditions.\n4.  **Connect Reactant to Product:** I will apply the most likely rearrangement mechanism to each potential starting material to predict the resulting product.\n5.  **Identify Compound X:** By comparing the predicted product from each option with the actual product structure derived from the NMR data, I can definitively identify Compound X.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound_x():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemical puzzle by analyzing NMR data and reaction pathways.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze NMR data to determine the product's structure.\n    # Key data points:\n    # - 13C NMR at 197.7 ppm -> Confirms a ketone (C=O).\n    # - 1H NMR shows two 3H singlets (2.28, 2.31 ppm) -> Two distinct methyl groups.\n    # - 1H NMR shows two 2H doublets (7.08, 7.71 ppm) -> A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    # - 1H NMR shows two 1H doublets (6.75, 7.68 ppm) -> A -CH=CH- group.\n    #\n    # Assembling these pieces:\n    # One methyl is on the p-substituted ring (a tolyl group).\n    # One methyl is part of a methyl ketone (acetyl group).\n    # These are linked by the vinyl group.\n    product_structure = \"4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one\"\n    product_formula = \"C11H12O\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of NMR data\")\n    print(f\"The product is identified as {product_structure} with the formula {product_formula}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Evaluate options and the chemical reaction.\n    # The product has a p-tolyl group.
