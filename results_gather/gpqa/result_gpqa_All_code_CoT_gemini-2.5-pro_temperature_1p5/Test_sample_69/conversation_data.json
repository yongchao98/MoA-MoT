    "My plan is to solve this chemical riddle by deducing the identity of each compound step-by-step, ultimately determining the structure and symmetry of product E.\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 3**: The hydrolysis of C (`C + H₂O -> A + F + G`) is the most revealing clue. The regeneration of solid A suggests it's a noble element resistant to water and acids, like Gold (Au) or Platinum (Pt). The formation of two acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G), indicates that C must contain the necessary elements.\n2.  **Deduce Identities A, B, C, F, G**: Let's hypothesize A is Gold (Au). Gold(III) chloride (AuCl₃), which exists as the dimer Au₂Cl₆, is a bright red solid, fitting the description of C. The gas B would therefore be Chlorine (Cl₂). The hydrolysis of Gold(III) compounds is complex and can lead to disproportionation, yielding solid Gold (A), Hydrochloric acid (F, a strong acid), and Auric acid (H₃AuO₃, a weak acid, G). This set of identities (A=Au, B=Cl₂, C=Au₂Cl₆, F=HCl, G=H₃AuO₃) is consistent.\n3.  **Deduce Identities D, H, and E**: Now let's analyze the remaining reactions.\n    *   Reaction 4: `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent)`. With B=Cl₂, a classic reaction is with sulfur dioxide gas (SO₂). `SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) -> SO₂Cl₂(l)`. Sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) is a liquid used as a non-aqueous solvent. This fits perfectly. So, D = SO₂ and H = SO₂Cl₂.\n    *   Reaction 2: `C + 2 D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)`. This becomes `Au₂Cl₆ + 2SO₂ -> E`. Gold(III) is an oxidizing agent and SO₂ is a reducing agent. A plausible anhydrous reaction is `Au₂Cl₆ + 2SO₂ -> 2AuCl + 2SO₂Cl₂`. The extremely hazardous product E formed in this reaction is sulfuryl chloride, SO₂Cl₂.\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E**: The final step is to find the point group of E = SO₂Cl₂.\n    *   **Structure**: The molecule has a distorted tetrahedral geometry with Sulfur at the center, bonded to two Oxygen atoms and two Chlorine atoms.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**: The molecule possesses only one symmetry element besides the identity operation (E): a two-fold rotation axis (C₂) that passes through the Sulfur atom and bisects both the O-S-O and Cl-S-Cl angles. There are no mirror planes (σ), inversion center (i), or higher-order rotation axes.\n    *   **Point Group**: A molecule with only a C₂ axis belongs to the C₂ point group.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\nimport io\nfrom contextlib import redirect_stdout\n\n# Create a string buffer to capture the output\nbuffer = io.StringIO()\n\n# Redirect stdout to the buffer\nwith redirect_stdout(buffer):\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the chemical compounds based on the reaction descriptions.\")\n    print(\"A = Au (Gold), solid.\")\n    print(\"B = Cl₂ (Chlorine), gas.\")\n    print(\"C = Au₂Cl₆ (Gold(III) chloride), a bright red solid.\")\n    print(\"D = SO₂ (Sulfur dioxide), gas.\")\n    print(\"E = SO₂Cl₂ (Sulfuryl chloride), an extremely hazardous liquid.\")\n    print(\"F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid), a strong acid.\")\n    print(\"G = H₃AuO₃ (Auric acid), a weak acid.\")\n    print(\"H = SO₂Cl₂ (Sulfuryl chloride), a solvent.
