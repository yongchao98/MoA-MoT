    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing equation:** The total mass of a binary star system (M_total = M1 + M2) can be related to its orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) of its stars. For a system with circular orbits viewed edge-on (as implied by the eclipses), the mass function derived from Kepler's laws shows that the total mass is proportional to the period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes.\n    *   M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\n2.  **Calculate the proportional mass for system 1:**\n    *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n    *   Velocity amplitudes (K1_1, K1_2) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n    *   Sum of velocities (V1_sum) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n    *   Proportional mass (Mass_1) ∝ 2 * (15)³\n\n3.  **Calculate the proportional mass for system 2:**\n    *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n    *   Velocity amplitudes (K2_1, K2_2) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n    *   Sum of velocities (V2_sum) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n    *   Proportional mass (Mass_2) ∝ 1 * (25)³\n\n4.  **Find the ratio:** To find how many times more massive system_1 is than system_2, we calculate the ratio Mass_1 / Mass_2. The constant of proportionality will cancel out.\n    *   Ratio = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will define the variables for each system, perform the calculations as described above, and print the final ratio.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Data for system_1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_1 = 10.0 # km/s\nK1_2 = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Data for system_2\nP2 = 1.0  # years\nK2_1 = 15.0 # km/s\nK2_2 = 10.0 # km/s\n\n# The total mass of a binary system is proportional to P * (K1 + K2)^3.\n# We can calculate the ratio of the masses without needing the constant of proportionality.\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocities for each system\nV_sum_1 = K1_1 + K1_2\nV_sum_2 = K2_1 + K2_2\n\n# Calculate the value proportional to the mass for each system\nmass_prop_1 = P1 * (V_sum_1 ** 3)\nmass_prop_2 = P2 * (V_sum_2 ** 3)\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2\nmass_ratio = mass_prop_1 / mass_prop_2\n\n# Print the result and the choices\nprint(f\"The calculated mass ratio (system_1 / system_2) is: {mass_ratio:.3f}\")\nprint(\"\\nChoices:\")\nprint(\"A) ~ 0.7\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 0.6\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 0.4\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 1.2\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated ratio is closest to option C.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
