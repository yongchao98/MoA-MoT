    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **State the Principle**: The problem relies on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ). For an unstable state, the lifetime (τ) can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, the inherent energy width of a state is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\n2.  **Calculate Energy Widths**: I will calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each of the two quantum states using their given lifetimes.\n    *   ΔE₁ for the state with lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ sec.\n    *   ΔE₂ for the state with lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ sec.\n    I'll perform the calculation using the value of ħ in electron-volt-seconds (eV·s) to get the result directly in eV.\n\n3.  **Determine Resolution Condition**: For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, their energy difference must be larger than their individual energy widths. The limiting factor is the state with the *larger* energy width (which corresponds to the *shorter* lifetime).\n\n4.  **Evaluate Options**: I will compare the required energy difference with the given multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) and select the option that satisfies the resolution condition.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculations and find the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and given values\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eV_s = 6.582e-16\n# Lifetime of state 1 in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\n# Lifetime of state 2 in seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8\n# The options for the energy difference in eV\noptions = {\n    'A': 1e-8,\n    'B': 1e-11,\n    'C': 1e-9,\n    'D': 1e-4\n}\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the energy width for each state\n# The energy width is calculated using the energy-time uncertainty principle: Delta_E = h_bar / tau\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eV_s / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eV_s / tau2\n\nprint(f\"The lifetime of state 1 is {tau1} s.\")\nprint(f\"The energy width of state 1 (ΔE1) is approximately: {delta_E1:.3e} eV\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"The lifetime of state 2 is {tau2} s.\")\nprint(f\"The energy width of state 2 (ΔE2) is approximately: {delta_E2:.3e} eV\\n\")\n\n# Step 3: Determine the resolution condition\n# To resolve the two states, their energy difference must be larger than the width of the broader line.\n# The broader line corresponds to the shorter lifetime, which gives a larger energy width.\nrequired_separation = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\nprint(f\"The broader energy width is {required_separation:.3e} eV.\")\nprint(\"To be clearly resolved, the energy difference between the two levels must be greater than this value.\\n\")\n\n# Step 4: Evaluate the given options\nprint(\"Evaluating the options:\")\ncorrect_option = None\nfor option, energy_diff in options.items():\n    if energy_diff > required_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {option}: {energy_diff:.1e} eV > {required_separation:.3e} eV. This is a possible energy difference.\")\n        correct_option = option\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option}: {energy_diff:.1e} eV <= {required_separation:.3e} eV. This is not large enough to resolve the states.\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe only option that provides a large enough energy difference to clearly resolve the two states is {correct_option}.\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer Choice: {correct_option}\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
