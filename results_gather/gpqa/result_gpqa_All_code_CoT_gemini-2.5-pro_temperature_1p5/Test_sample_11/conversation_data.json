    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:** The decay of a particle at rest is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the energies are given in MeV, we must use relativistic formulas.\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay equals the total energy after.\n    *   Before decay, the pion (Pi+) is stationary. Its total energy is just its rest mass energy, `E_pi = m_pi * c²`.\n    *   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu), `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n    *   So, `m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`.\n3.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay is zero, as the pion is stationary. Therefore, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero.\n    *   This means the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum: `p_mu = p_nu = p`.\n4.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest mass `m` of a particle are related by `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\n5.  **Derive the formulas:**\n    *   From the energy-momentum relation, we can write `(p*c)² = E² - (m*c²)²`.\n    *   Since `p_mu² = p_nu²`, we have `(p_mu*c)² = (p_nu*c)²`.\n    *   This gives `E_mu² - (m_mu*c²)² = E_nu² - (m_nu*c²)²`.\n    *   The neutrino's rest mass is negligible (`m_nu ≈ 0`), so the equation becomes `E_mu² - (m_mu*c²)² = E_nu²`.\n    *   From energy conservation, we have `E_nu = m_pi*c² - E_mu`. Substituting this into the previous equation allows us to solve for `E_mu`.\n    *   `E_mu² - (m_mu*c²)² = (m_pi*c² - E_mu)²`.\n    *   Solving this for `E_mu` yields the total energy of the muon: `E_mu = ( (m_pi*c²)² + (m_mu*c²)² ) / (2 * m_pi*c²)`.\n6.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   Once we find the total energy of the muon (`E_mu`), its kinetic energy is `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c²`.\n    *   The total energy of the neutrino (`E_nu`) is found by energy conservation: `E_nu = m_pi*c² - E_mu`.\n    *   Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy: `KE_nu = E_nu`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest energy of Pi(+)\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest energy of mu(+)\n\n# The initial pion is stationary, so its total energy is its rest energy.\nE_initial = m_pi_c2\n\n# In a two-body decay of a particle at rest, the total energy of one of the products (muon) is given by:\n# E_mu = ( (m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2 ) / ( 2 * m_pi*c^2 )\nE_mu = (m_pi_c2**2 + m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy.\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# By conservation of energy, the total energy of the neutrino is the remaining energy.\nE_nu = E_initial - E_mu\n\n# For a massless particle like a neutrino, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places.\n# The format is KE_mu, KE_nu\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the muon is: {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the neutrino is: {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\")\nprint(\"B) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\")\nprint(\"C) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\")\nprint(\"D) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated values match option A.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
