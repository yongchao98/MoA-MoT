    "My plan is to solve this physics problem by breaking down Maxwell's equations and analyzing how the hypothetical existence of a magnetic monopole would alter them.\n\n1.  **List Standard Maxwell's Equations:** I will first recall the four standard equations and what they represent physically (divergence/flux, curl/circulation for both electric and magnetic fields).\n2.  **Introduce the Magnetic Monopole:** I will define what a magnetic monopole is—an isolated magnetic charge—and consider its implications.\n3.  **Analyze the Impact on Each Equation:**\n    *   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0):** This law explicitly states there are no magnetic monopoles. If they existed, this law would have to change to include a magnetic charge density term, making the divergence of the magnetic field non-zero.\n    *   **Faraday's Law of Induction (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t):** This law relates a changing magnetic field to a circulating electric field. If magnetic charges exist, symmetry with the Ampère-Maxwell law suggests that a current of these magnetic charges would also create a circulating electric field. Therefore, this equation would also change.\n    *   **Gauss's Law for Electricity (∇ ⋅ E = ρ/ε₀):** This law concerns electric charges and is unaffected by the existence of magnetic ones.\n    *   **Ampère-Maxwell Law (∇ × B = ...):** This law concerns how electric currents create magnetic fields. It is also unaffected by the existence of magnetic monopoles.\n4.  **Compare with Options:** Based on the analysis, the equations for the **divergence of the magnetic field** and the **circulation of the electric field** are the ones that would be different.\n5.  **Select the Correct Option:** I will match this conclusion with the provided multiple-choice options to identify the correct answer.\n6.  **Construct the Python Code:** The code will automate this reasoning process, printing each step and finally outputting the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_maxwell_monopole_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes Maxwell's equations to determine which would change\n    if magnetic monopoles existed.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define Maxwell's Equations and their physical meaning\n    equations = {\n        \"Gauss's Law for Electricity\": \"Relates the DIVERGENCE of the electric field to electric charge.\",\n        \"Gauss's Law for Magnetism\": \"States the DIVERGENCE of the magnetic field is zero (i.e., no magnetic monopoles).\",\n        \"Faraday's Law of Induction\": \"Relates the CIRCULATION (curl) of the electric field to a changing magnetic field.\",\n        \"Ampère-Maxwell Law\": \"Relates the CIRCULATION (curl) of the magnetic field to electric current and a changing electric field.\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Analyzing Maxwell's Equations and Magnetic Monopoles ---\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Explain the implication of a magnetic monopole\n    print(\"\\nThe problem assumes the existence of a magnetic monopole, which is an isolated magnetic charge (like an isolated North or South pole).\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's see how this affects each equation:\")\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the changes\n    analysis = [\n        (\"Gauss's Law for Magnetism:\", \"This equation (divergence of B = 0) is a direct statement that monopoles DON'T exist.
