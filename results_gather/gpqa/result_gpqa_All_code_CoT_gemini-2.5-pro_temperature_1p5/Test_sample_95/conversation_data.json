    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Convert Units**: The given distance `d` is in parsecs and the angular size `θ` is in degrees. For physics calculations using standard constants, we need to convert these to SI units (meters and radians, respectively).\n2.  **Calculate Physical Size**: Using the small-angle approximation, the physical diameter `D` of the event horizon can be calculated from its angular size `θ` and distance `d`. The formula is `D = d * θ`, where `θ` must be in radians.\n3.  **Find the Schwarzschild Radius**: The diameter of the event horizon is twice the Schwarzschild radius (`R_s`). So, `R_s = D / 2`.\n4.  **Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy**: The entropy `S` of a non-rotating, uncharged black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. A convenient form of this formula relates entropy directly to the Schwarzschild radius:\n    `S = (π * R_s² * k_B * c³) / (ħ * G)`\n    where:\n    *   `R_s` is the Schwarzschild radius.\n    *   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant (`1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K`).\n    *   `c` is the speed of light (`2.99792458 × 10⁸ m/s`).\n    *   `ħ` (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant (`1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s`).\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant (`6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³·kg⁻¹·s⁻²`).\n\nBy plugging the calculated `R_s` into this formula, we can find the entropy `S` and determine its order of magnitude.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 0: Define constants and given values\n# Physical constants in SI units\nG = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nc = 2.99792458e8   # Speed of light (m/s)\nk_B = 1.380649e-23 # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\nhbar = 1.0545718e-34 # Reduced Planck constant (J*s)\n\n# Conversion factors\nparsec_to_meter = 3.086e16 # meters in one parsec\n\n# Given values\nd_parsecs = 10**10 # distance in parsecs\ntheta_degrees = 10**-17 # angular size in degrees\n\n# --- Calculation Steps ---\n\n# Step 1: Convert units to SI\n# Convert distance from parsecs to meters\nd_meters = d_parsecs * parsec_to_meter\n\n# Convert angular size from degrees to radians\ntheta_radians = math.radians(theta_degrees)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the physical diameter of the event horizon\n# Using the small-angle approximation: Diameter = distance * angular size (in radians)\nD_meters = d_meters * theta_radians\n\n# Step 3: Find the Schwarzschild Radius\n# The Schwarzschild radius is half the diameter of the event horizon\nR_s = D_meters / 2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy\n# S = (pi * R_s^2 * k_B * c^3) / (hbar * G)\nentropy = (math.pi * R_s**2 * k_B * c**3) / (hbar * G)\n\n# --- Output the result ---\n\nprint(f\"The distance d is {d_meters:.2e} meters.\")\nprint(f\"The angular size θ is {theta_radians:.2e} radians.\")\nprint(f\"The Schwarzschild radius R_s is {R_s:.2e} meters.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated entropy of the black hole is {entropy:.2e} J/K.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 10^59 J/K\")\nprint(\"B) 10^66 J/K\")\nprint(\"C) 10^65 J/K\")\nprint(\"D) 10^62 J/K\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated order of magnitude (10^62) matches option D.\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
