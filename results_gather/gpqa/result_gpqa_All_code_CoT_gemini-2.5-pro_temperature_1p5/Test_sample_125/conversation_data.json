    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:** Determine the products formed from the reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Pay close attention to the stereochemistry.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:** Determine the products formed from the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione. Identify all stereoisomers (enantiomers, diastereomers, meso compounds).\n3.  **Count Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on polarity. Diastereomers and constitutional isomers have different polarities and will separate, but enantiomers have identical polarities in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak.\n4.  **Count Peaks in Chiral-Phase HPLC:** A chiral stationary phase can differentiate between enantiomers. Therefore, all unique stereoisomers will be resolved and appear as separate peaks.\n5.  **Match the Result:** Compare the calculated number of peaks to the given options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution:\n\n*   **Reaction I Products:**\n    *   The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. It has one chiral center at the C5 position.\n    *   LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   Since LAH is an achiral reagent, it attacks the planar carbonyl group from both faces, producing both (R) and (S) configurations at the new C3 chiral center.\n    *   The original C5 stereocenter remains unchanged.\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed: **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** and **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**. These two molecules are **diastereomers**.\n\n*   **Reaction II Products:**\n    *   The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, which is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n    *   Excess NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups to alcohols, creating two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)** and **(2S, 4S)** are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)** has a plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration).\n    *   Therefore, three distinct stereoisomers are formed in this reaction.\n\n*   **Combined Mixture:** The final mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = 5 unique stereoisomers.\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC Analysis (Achiral):**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)) have different physical properties and will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will co-elute as **1 peak**. The meso compound ((2R, 4S)) is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will separate, giving a second peak. This results in **2 peaks** from Reaction II's products.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (pentanediols), so they will not co-elute.\n    *   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral-Phase HPLC Analysis:**\n    *   A chiral column separates all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    *   Since there are 5 unique stereoisomers in the total mixture, the chiral HPLC will resolve all of them.\n    *   Total peaks in chiral-phase HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The analysis predicts 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.\n# The reactant (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is chiral.\n# The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center.\n# This results in two diastereomeric products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\nproducts_reaction1 = 2 # Diastereomers\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.\n# The reactant pentane-2,4-dione is achiral.\n# The reduction creates two new chiral centers (C2 and C4).\n# This results in a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound ((2R, 4S)).\nenantiomers_reaction2 = 2\nmeso_compounds_reaction2 = 1\nproducts_reaction2 = enantiomers_reaction2 + meso_compounds_reaction2 # Total unique stereoisomers from Reaction II\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total number of unique compounds in the mixture.\ntotal_unique_compounds = products_reaction1 + products_reaction2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the number of peaks in Chiral-Phase HPLC.\n# A chiral column separates all unique stereoisomers.\nchiral_hplc_peaks = total_unique_compounds\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the number of peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC.\n# A normal (achiral) column separates diastereomers and constitutional isomers, but not enantiomers.\n# Peaks from Reaction I: The 2 products are diastereomers, so they separate.\npeaks_from_rxn1_normal = 2\n# Peaks from Reaction II: The enantiomeric pair co-elutes (1 peak), and the meso compound gives a separate peak.\npeaks_from_rxn2_normal = 1 + meso_compounds_reaction2\n# Total peaks are the sum, as products from Rxn I and II are structurally different and won't overlap.\nnormal_phase_hplc_peaks = peaks_from_rxn1_normal + peaks_from_rxn2_normal\n\n# Step 6: Present the results and determine the correct option.\nprint(f\"Number of products from Reaction I: {products_reaction1}\")\nprint(f\"Number of products from Reaction II: {products_reaction2}\")\nprint(f\"Total unique compounds in the mixture: {total_unique_compounds}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC: {normal_phase_hplc_peaks}\")\nprint(f\"Number of peaks in chiral HPLC: {chiral_hplc_peaks}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(\"The result is:\")\nprint(f\"{chiral_hplc_peaks} Peaks in chiral HPLC and {normal_phase_hplc_peaks} peaks in normal-phase HPLC\")\n\n# Match with options\n# A) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n# B) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n# C) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n# D) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\ncorrect_option = 'B'\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {correct_option}.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
