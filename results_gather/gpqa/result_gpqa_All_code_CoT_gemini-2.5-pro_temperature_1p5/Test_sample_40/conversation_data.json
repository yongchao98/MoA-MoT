    "This problem can be solved using the relativistic velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory of special relativity. Here is the step-by-step plan to derive the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:** We have two main frames of reference:\n    *   **The Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame, which is considered stationary.\n    *   **The Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference of the moving glass. It moves with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the glass (frame S') with respect to the laboratory (frame S).\n    *   `u'`: The velocity of the light beam with respect to the glass (frame S'). The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:** The formula to find the resultant velocity `u` in the laboratory frame (S) when adding two velocities (`v` and `u'`) is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute and Simplify:** We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To simplify this fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n/n + n*v) / (n + n*v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The derived expression for the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This matches option D.\n\nThe following Python code will print out the choices and identify the correct one based on this derivation.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the speed of light in a moving medium relative to a stationary observer.\n# This is a classic application of the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\n# Let's define the variables based on the problem statement:\n# n = index of refraction of the glass\n# v = velocity of the glass in the lab frame\n# c = speed of light in vacuum, which is set to 1.\n\n# The speed of light within the glass (in the glass's own rest frame) is u' = c/n.\n# Since c=1, u' = 1/n.\n\n# The relativistic velocity addition formula is: u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)\n# where u is the speed of light relative to the observer in the laboratory.\n\n# Substitute u' = 1/n and c = 1 into the formula:\n# u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2)\n# u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)\n\n# To simplify the expression, we find a common denominator for the numerator and the denominator.\n# Numerator: 1/n + v = (1 + n*v) / n\n# Denominator: 1 + v/n = (n + v) / n\n# u = ((1 + n*v) / n) / ((n + v) / n)\n\n# The '/n' terms cancel out, leaving:\n# u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)\n\n# Now, we list the given options and identify the correct one.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"1\",\n    \"B\": \"(1-n*v)/(n+v)\",\n    \"C\": \"(1+n*v)/(n-v)\",\n    \"D\": \"(1+n*v)/(n+v)\"\n}\n\nresult_formula = \"(1+n*v)/(n+v)\"\ncorrect_option_letter = None\n\nprint(\"The given options are:\")\nfor option, formula in options.items():\n    print(f\"{option}) {formula}\")\n    if formula == result_formula:\n        correct_option_letter = option\n\nprint(f\"\\nBased on the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is {result_formula}.\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {correct_option_letter}.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
