    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem regarding the radiation from an oscillating spheroid charge distribution.\n\n### My Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the angular dependence:** The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a symmetry axis (z-axis). This is characteristic of an electric dipole radiation pattern. The power radiated per unit solid angle for such a system is given by `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`, where `θ` is the angle with the symmetry axis.\n2.  **Calculate the fraction:** The maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum, which is 1 (at `θ = 90°`). I will calculate the value of `sin²(θ)` for `θ = 30°` to find the fraction of `A` radiated at that angle.\n3.  **Analyze the wavelength dependence:** The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is also proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency, `ω⁴` (from the Larmor formula). I need to relate `ω` to the wavelength `λ`. The relationship is `ω = 2πf` and `c = fλ`, which implies `ω = 2πc/λ`. Therefore, `ω ∝ 1/λ`.\n4.  **Determine the form of f:** By substituting the relationship from step 3 into the power formula, I can find the dependence of the radiated power on `λ`. `Power ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n5.  **Combine the results:** I will combine the calculated fraction and the derived wavelength dependence to select the correct option among the given choices.\n6.  **Write the Python code:** The code will perform the calculation for the fraction and print the step-by-step reasoning for both parts of the problem, finally identifying the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the angular dependence of the radiated power.\n# For an oscillating charge distribution like a spheroid (which can be modeled as an electric dipole),\n# the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle is given by dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ),\n# where θ is the angle with the axis of oscillation.\n\n# The maximum power, A, is radiated when sin²(θ) is maximum.\n# The maximum value of sin²(θ) is 1, which occurs at θ = 90 degrees.\n# So, A ∝ 1.\n\n# We need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees.\n# This fraction is (Power at 30°) / (Max Power) = (k * sin²(30°)) / (k * 1) = sin²(30°).\n\n# Calculate the fraction.\ntheta_degrees = 30\n# math functions in Python use radians, so convert degrees to radians.\ntheta_radians = math.radians(theta_degrees)\n\n# Calculate sin²(30°).\nfraction = math.sin(theta_radians)**2\n\n# The exact value of sin(30°) is 0.5, so sin²(30°) is 0.5² = 0.25, or 1/4.\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the wavelength dependence of the radiated power.\n# The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴).\n# Power ∝ ω⁴\n# The angular frequency ω is related to the wavelength λ by ω = 2πc/λ, where c is the speed of light.\n# This means ω is inversely proportional to λ (ω ∝ 1/λ).\n# Therefore, the power dependence on λ is:\n# Power ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴.\n\n# Step 3: Combine the results to choose the correct option.\n# The fraction of A is 1/4.\n# The form of the function f is λ⁻⁴.\n# This matches option C.\n\nprint(\"Analysis of the problem:\")\nprint(\"1.
