    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The problem describes four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin are fermions. A key property of fermions is that they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n2.  **Define Quantum States:** For a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, a quantum state is defined by its principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and its spin quantum number `m_s` (spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n3.  **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in a 1D infinite well is given by `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2mL^2)`. The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2mL^2)`, so the single-particle energy levels are simply `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n4.  **Apply Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since each energy level `n` can accommodate two fermions (one with spin-up and one with spin-down), we will fill these levels starting from the lowest energy (`n=1`) to find the total energy of the multi-particle system.\n5.  **Calculate Ground State Energy (E_g):** To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions.\n    *   Place two fermions in the `n=1` level (E_1 = 1²E = 1E).\n    *   Place the remaining two fermions in the `n=2` level (E_2 = 2²E = 4E).\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: E_g = 2 * E_1 + 2 * E_2.\n6.  **Calculate First Excited State Energy (E_1st):** To get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the next available empty level.\n    *   Move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   The configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy is: E_1st = 2 * E_1 + 1 * E_2 + 1 * E_3.\n7.  **Calculate Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):** This is the state with the next lowest energy. We must consider different possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n    *   **Case a):** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration is: one in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   **Case b):** Promote the second particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration is: two in `n=1`, zero in `n=2`, two in `n=3`.\n    *   **Case c):** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration is: two in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Calculate the energy for each case and the lowest of these will be the second excited state energy.\n8.  **Final Comparison:** Compare the calculated energies (E_g, E_1st, E_2nd) with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_particle_energy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energies of the ground state, first excited state,\n    and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in\n    a 1D infinite potential well.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The energy of a single particle in level n is n^2 * E.\n    # We will calculate the total energy in units of E.\n    \n    # --- Ground State ---\n    # To get the lowest total energy (ground state), we fill the lowest\n    # available energy levels.
