    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct formula for the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Setup**\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` located a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential, which we can set to zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` induces a separation of charges on the surface of the sphere. We need to find the potential energy of this entire configuration.\n\n**2. Apply the Method of Image Charges**\nThis problem is best solved using the \"method of image charges.\" This technique simplifies the problem by replacing the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, imaginary \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is the superposition of the field from the original charge `q` and this new image charge `q'`.\n\nThe properties of the image charge are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero. For a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` (measured from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to `q`) are given by:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `d' = R^2 / d`\n\n**3. Calculate the Potential Energy**\nThe potential energy (`U`) of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinitely far away to its final position at distance `d`. An elegant way to calculate this energy is with the formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nHere, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` that is created by all other charges in the system, which in this case is the induced charge on the sphere's surface. In our image charge model, this potential is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n**4. Deriving the Final Formula**\nLet's calculate `V_induced`:\n\n*   The potential at distance `r` from a point charge `Q` is `V = k * Q / r`.\n*   The charge creating the potential is the image charge `q'`.\n*   The distance from the image charge `q'` (at `d'`) to the real charge `q` (at `d`) is `d - d'`.\n*   So, `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'`:\n\n*   `V_induced = k * [-q * (R / d)] / [d - (R^2 / d)]`\n*   Simplify the denominator: `d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n*   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R / d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n*   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nFinally, substitute this `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n\n*   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n*   `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nComparing this derived formula with the given options, we find it matches option B exactly.\n\n```python\n# The physical problem is to find the potential energy of a point charge 'q'\n# placed a distance 'd' from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius 'R'.\n\n# We use the method of image charges. The grounded sphere is replaced by an\n# image charge q' at a distance d' from the center.\n# The image charge has a magnitude q' = -q * (R/d).\n# The image charge is located at a position d' = R^2 / d.\n\n# The potential energy U of the system is given by U = (1/2) * q * V_induced,\n# where V_induced is the potential at the location of q due to the induced charges\n# on the sphere. This potential is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge q'.\n\n# The potential V_induced is calculated as k * q' / (distance between q and q').\n# The distance between q (at d) and q' (at d') is (d - d').\n# So, V_induced = k * q' / (d - d').\n\n# Substituting the expressions for q' and d':\n# V_induced = k * (-q * R / d) / (d - R^2 / d)\n# V_induced = k * (-q * R / d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)\n# V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)\n\n# Now, substitute this into the energy formula:\n# U = (1/2) * q * V_induced\n# U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]\n# U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)\n\n# We compare this derived formula with the given options:\n# A) U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2)\n# B) U = - (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 - R^2)\n# C) U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 - R^2)\n# D) U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 + R^2)\n\n# Our result matches option B.\ncorrect_choice = 'B'\n\nprint(\"The step-by-step derivation shows that the formula for the net potential energy is U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2).\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option: {correct_choice}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
