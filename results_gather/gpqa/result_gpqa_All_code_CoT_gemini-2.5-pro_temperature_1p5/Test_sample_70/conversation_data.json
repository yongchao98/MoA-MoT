    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principles:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on its distance from the star (a). The relationship is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which simplifies to $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$, assuming constant stellar luminosity and planetary albedo.\n2.  **Relate orbital distance to orbital period:** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a), i.e., $P^2 \\propto a^3$. For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is the orbital radius. This can be rewritten as $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n3.  **Combine the relationships:** By substituting the relationship from Kepler's Law into the temperature formula, we can find the direct relationship between temperature and period:\n    *   Since $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$ and $a \\propto P^{2/3}$, it follows that $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{P^{2/3}}$.\n    *   This simplifies to $T_{eq} \\propto 1/P^{1/3}$.\n4.  **Calculate the temperature ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which is $T_4 / T_2$. Using the relationship derived above:\n    *   $T_4 / T_2 = (1/P_4^{1/3}) / (1/P_2^{1/3}) = (P_2/P_4)^{1/3}$.\n5.  **Use the given orbital period ratios:** The problem gives the orbital period ratios as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. This means we can use the relative values for the calculation: $P_2 = 2$ and $P_4 = 3.5$.\n6.  **Compute the final value:** Substitute the period values into the equation and calculate the result. The python code will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the orbital period ratios for Planet 2 and Planet 4 from the given data.\n# The ratio of periods P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nP_ratio_2 = 2.0\nP_ratio_4 = 3.5\n\n# Step 2: The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_4 / T_2) is related to the ratio of orbital periods (P_2 / P_4)\n# by the formula: (T_4 / T_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3).\n# This is derived from T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a) and Kepler's Third Law a ∝ P^(2/3).\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the periods P_2 / P_4.\nperiod_ratio = P_ratio_2 / P_ratio_4\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\n# Step 5: Print the calculated ratio and compare with the given choices.\nprint(f\"The ratio of the orbital periods (P_2 / P_4) is: {period_ratio:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_4 / T_2) is: {temperature_ratio:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing the result with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) ~0.57\")\nprint(\"B) ~0.75\")\nprint(\"C) ~0.69\")\nprint(\"D) ~0.83\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value of ~0.8300 matches option D.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: D\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
