    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this astronomical problem, followed by the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Establish Detection Criteria:** I will first determine the two main conditions a star must meet to be detectable by ESPRESSO at the Paranal Observatory.\n    *   **Brightness Limit:** I'll consult the official ESPRESSO performance information from the provided link to find the faintest apparent V magnitude (m_V) that allows for a Signal-to-Noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour observation. According to the data, a V=16 magnitude star achieves an S/N of 12, so our limiting magnitude is approximately 16. Any star with `m_V <= 16` will be detectable in terms of brightness.\n    *   **Visibility from Paranal:** The VLT is located at the Paranal Observatory in Chile, at a latitude of about -24.6Â°. A star's declination (DEC) determines its visibility from a given latitude. Stars with a very high northern declination (such as Polaris) never rise above the horizon at Paranal. I will calculate the declination limit for visibility from this location.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Star:** I will assess each star from the list against these two criteria.\n    *   For **Canopus** and **Polaris**, I will use their well-known apparent magnitudes and declinations.\n    *   For stars **c, d, e, and f**, the absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d) are provided. I will calculate their apparent magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`.\n    *   I will then check if each star's apparent magnitude is less than or equal to the brightness limit and if its declination allows it to be seen from Paranal.\n\n3.  **Count and Determine the Answer:** Finally, I'll count the number of stars that meet both conditions. This total count will correspond to one of the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, or D).\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_detectability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of stars to determine how many are detectable by the\n    ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory based on magnitude and visibility.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
