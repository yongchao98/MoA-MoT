    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** Radioactive decay is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay. We can treat the problem as if we are starting to observe a fresh atom at t=0.\n2.  **Calculate the Decay Constant (λ):** The probability of decay is governed by the formula P(decay) = 1 - e^(-λt), where 'λ' is the decay constant and 't' is time. We are given that P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32. We can rearrange the formula to solve for λ:\n    *   0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n    *   e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n    *   -λ * 100 = ln(0.68)\n    *   λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n3.  **Calculate the New Probability:** Now, we need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. We use the same formula with the λ we just found, but with t = 150 minutes.\n    *   P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n4.  **Code and Compare:** We will implement these calculations in Python, convert the final probability to a percentage, and see which option it matches.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Step 1: Define initial conditions and calculate the decay constant (lambda) ---\n# Probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%\np_decay_100 = 0.32\ntime_100 = 100\n\n# The probability of survival is 1 - p_decay\np_survival_100 = 1 - p_decay_100\n\n# From the decay law P(survival) = e^(-lambda * t), we can find lambda:\n# lambda = -ln(P(survival)) / t\nlambda_val = -math.log(p_survival_100) / time_100\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes ---\n# The process is memoryless, so we calculate the probability for a new interval of 150 minutes.\ntime_150 = 150\n\n# Use the decay formula P(decay) = 1 - e^(-lambda * t)\np_decay_150 = 1 - math.exp(-lambda_val * time_150)\n\n# Convert the probability to a percentage\np_decay_150_percent = p_decay_150 * 100\n\n# --- Step 3: Print the result and the options ---\nprint(\"The calculated probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is: {:.2f}%\".format(p_decay_150_percent))\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 48%\")\nprint(\"B) 52%\")\nprint(\"C) 44%\")\nprint(\"D) 40%\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
