    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the pH of the final solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Moles**: First, we'll calculate the number of moles for each of the solutes before they are mixed. Remember that moles are calculated as Molarity Ã— Volume (in Liters).\n2.  **Identify Species and Moles**: We need to identify the reactive species in the solution: H+ from the strong acid (HCl), OH- from the strong base (Ba(OH)2), and the weak acid (CH3COOH). Note that Ba(OH)2 dissociates to produce two moles of OH- for every one mole of Ba(OH)2.\n3.  **Neutralization Reactions**:\n    *   **Strong Acid vs. Strong Base**: The strong acid (H+) will react completely with the strong base (OH-) first. We'll determine which one is in excess.\n    *   **Excess Reagent vs. Weak Acid/Base**: The excess reagent from the first reaction (either H+ or OH-) will then react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n4.  **Determine Final Composition**: After all reactions are complete, we will find the final moles of the species that dictate the pH. In this case, there will be an excess of strong base (OH-).\n5.  **Calculate Final Concentration**: We'll calculate the total volume of the mixed solution and use it to find the final concentration of the excess OH-.\n6.  **Calculate pH**: Using the final concentration of OH-, we will first calculate the pOH (`pOH = -log10[OH-]`) and then find the pH using the formula `pH = 14 - pOH`.\n7.  **Select the Answer**: Finally, we will compare the calculated pH to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Calculate initial moles of all reactive species\n# Volumes are converted from mL to L\nvol_ch3cooh = 0.500  # L\nmol_ch3cooh = 0.1  # M\nmoles_ch3cooh = mol_ch3cooh * vol_ch3cooh\n\nvol_hcl = 0.400  # L\nmol_hcl = 0.2  # M\nmoles_h_from_hcl = mol_hcl * vol_hcl\n\nvol_baoh2 = 0.300  # L\nmol_baoh2 = 0.3  # M\n# Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba2+ and 2 OH-\nmoles_oh_from_baoh2 = (mol_baoh2 * vol_baoh2) * 2\n\nprint(f\"Initial moles of CH3COOH: {moles_ch3cooh:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Initial moles of H+ from HCl: {moles_h_from_hcl:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Initial moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: {moles_oh_from_baoh2:.3f}\\n\")\n\n# Step 3a: Neutralization of strong acid and strong base\nprint(\"Step 3a: Strong Acid-Base Neutralization\")\nmoles_oh_after_hcl = moles_oh_from_baoh2 - moles_h_from_hcl\nprint(f\"Moles of OH- remaining after reacting with HCl: {moles_oh_after_hcl:.3f}\\n\")\n\n# Step 3b: Neutralization of excess strong base with weak acid\nprint(\"Step 3b: Strong Base-Weak Acid Neutralization\")\n# The remaining OH- reacts with CH3COOH\nmoles_oh_final = moles_oh_after_hcl - moles_ch3cooh\nprint(f\"Final moles of excess OH- after reacting with CH3COOH: {moles_oh_final:.3f}\\n\")\n\n# Step 4 & 5: Calculate total volume and final concentration of OH-\ntotal_volume = vol_ch3cooh + vol_hcl + vol_baoh2\nfinal_conc_oh = moles_oh_final / total_volume\nprint(f\"Total volume of the solution: {total_volume:.1f} L\")\nprint(f\"Final concentration of OH-: {final_conc_oh:.4f} M\\n\")\n\n# Step 6: Calculate pOH and pH\npoh = -math.log10(final_conc_oh)\nph = 14 - poh\nprint(f\"Calculated pOH: {poh:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated pH: {ph:.2f}\\n\")\n\n# Step 7: Print the choices and the final answer\nprint(\"The options are:\")\nprint(\"A) 12.62\")\nprint(\"B) 8.92\")\nprint(\"C) 8.68\")\nprint(\"D) 1.38\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated pH is 12.62, which corresponds to option A.\")\n\n<<<A>>>\n```"
