    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Construct the Operator**: The operator $\\vec{P}$ is a vector operator with components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$. The operator for the spin component along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector**: The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A unit vector in the x-z plane can be represented in spherical coordinates with the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$. So, $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.\n3.  **Formulate the Operator Matrix**: We substitute the components of $\\vec{n}$ and the given matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ into the expression for $P_{\\vec{n}}$:\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$.\n    This will result in a 2x2 matrix representing the operator $P_{\\vec{n}}$.\n4.  **Set Up the Eigenvalue Equation**: The problem asks for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. We need to solve the equation $P_{\\vec{n}} |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$. Let the eigenvector be represented by a column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector**: Solving the matrix equation will yield a system of two linear equations in terms of the components $a$ and $b$. We will solve for the ratio of $b$ to $a$.\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector**: Finally, we apply the normalization condition $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$ to find the specific values for $a$ and $b$.\n7.  **Identify the Correct Option**: We will compare the calculated components of the normalized eigenvector with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to perform these calculations symbolically.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_eigenvector_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the normalized eigenvector of a quantum operator P along a direction n\n    in the x-z plane for the eigenvalue +hbar/2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols\n    hbar = sp.Symbol('hbar', positive=True)\n    theta = sp.Symbol('theta', real=True)\n    \n    # Define the component operators based on the problem description\n    # Px = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\n    # Py = (hbar/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n    # Pz = (hbar/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n    Px = (hbar / 2) * sp.Matrix([[0, 1], [1, 0]])\n    Pz = (hbar / 2) * sp.Matrix([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\n    \n    # Define the unit direction vector n in the x-z plane\n    # n = (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta))\n    nx = sp.sin(theta)\n    nz = sp.cos(theta)\n    \n    # Construct the operator P_n = Px*nx + Pz*nz\n    P_n = Px * nx + Pz * nz\n    \n    # The eigenvalue is given as +hbar/2.
