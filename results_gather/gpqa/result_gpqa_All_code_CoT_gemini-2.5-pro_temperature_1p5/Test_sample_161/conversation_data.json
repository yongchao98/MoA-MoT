    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Area Element**: The area of a surface is calculated by integrating the area element, $dA$, over the specified region. The area element is derived from the metric tensor $g_{ij}$. The given metric is $ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$. This is a 2D metric in Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$.\n    The metric tensor is a diagonal matrix:\n    $g = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{xx} & g_{xy} \\\\ g_{yx} & g_{yy} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The area element is $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)}\\,dx\\,dy$.\n    $\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2$.\n    Therefore, $dA = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2}\\,dx\\,dy = \\frac{32}{|4-x^2-y^2|}\\,dx\\,dy$.\n\n2.  **Define the Domain of Integration**: The problem mentions a \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\". This implies that the domain of integration is the open disk $D$ where $x^2+y^2 < 4$. In this domain, the term $4 - x^2 - y^2$ is always positive, so the absolute value is unnecessary.\n    $dA = \\frac{32}{4-(x^2+y^2)}\\,dx\\,dy$.\n\n3.  **Set up the Area Integral**: The total area $A$ is the double integral of the area element over the disk $D$.\n    $A = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\,dx\\,dy$.\n\n4.  **Convert to Polar Coordinates**: To solve the integral, we switch to polar coordinates $(\\rho, \\theta)$, where $x = \\rho \\cos\\theta$ and $y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$. This means $x^2+y^2 = \\rho^2$ and the differential area element is $dx\\,dy = \\rho\\,d\\rho\\,d\\theta$. The domain $D$ is described by $0 \\le \\rho < 2$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$.\n    The integral becomes:\n    $A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\rho \\,d\\rho\\,d\\theta$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral**: We can separate the integral into two parts:\n    $A = \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\,d\\rho \\right)$.\n    The first integral is simply $2\\pi$. The second integral is an improper integral because the denominator becomes zero at the upper limit $\\rho=2$.\n    Let's evaluate the integral over $\\rho$ using the substitution $u = 4-\\rho^2$, so $du = -2\\rho\\,d\\rho$. The integration limits change from $\\rho=0 \\to u=4$ and $\\rho=2 \\to u=0$.\n    $\\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\,d\\rho = \\int_{4}^{0} \\frac{32}{-2u} \\,du = \\int_{0}^{4} \\frac{16}{u} \\,du = 16 [\\ln|u|]_0^4$.\n    This expression contains $\\ln(0)$, which diverges to $-\\infty$. Thus, the integral evaluates to $+\\infty$.\n    Since the radial part of the integral is infinite, the total area is also infinite.\n\nThe code below will use the `sympy` library to confirm this result symbolically.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_area_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the area of the pseudosphere using symbolic integration.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols for polar coordinates\n    rho, theta = sp.symbols('rho theta')\n\n    # Define the integrand in polar coordinates\n    # dA = (32 / (4 - rho^2)) * rho d(rho) d(theta)\n    integrand = (32 * rho) / (4 - rho**2)\n\n    # Explain the mathematical setup using LaTeX formatting\n    explanation = r\"\"\"\nThe area of the surface is given by the integral A = \\iint_D dA, where dA is the area element.\nFrom the metric ds^2 = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}(dx^2+dy^2), the area element is:\ndA = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\,dx\\,dy = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\,dx\\,dy\nThe integration is over the disk D defined by x^2+y^2 < 4.\nIn polar coordinates (\\rho, \\theta), the integral becomes:\nA = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\rho \\,d\\rho\\,d\\theta\nThe inner integral with respect to \\rho is improper and can be shown to diverge:\n\\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\,d\\rho = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\left[ -16 \\ln(4-\\rho^2) \\right]_0^a = +\\infty\nSince this part of the integral diverges, the total area is infinite.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Mathematical Derivation:\")\n    print(explanation)\n\n    # Perform the symbolic integration using sympy\n    # The inner integral (with respect to rho from 0 to 2)\n    inner_integral_result = sp.integrate(integrand, (rho, 0, 2))\n\n    # The outer integral (with respect to theta from 0 to 2*pi)\n    # is just a multiplication by 2*pi.\n    total_area = inner_integral_result * (2 * sp.pi)\n\n    # Check the result and determine the choice\n    if total_area == sp.oo:  # sp.oo represents infinity\n        choice = 'B'\n        result_text = \"The calculated area is +infinity.\"\n    else:\n        # This case is not expected\n        choice = None\n        result_text = f\"The calculated area is {total_area}.\"\n\n    print(\"\\nSymbolic Calculation Result:\")\n    print(result_text)\n\n    print(\"\\nAvailable Options:\")\n    print(\"A) 4\\\\pi(x^2+y^2)\")\n    print(\"B) +\\\\infty\")\n    print(\"C) 4\\\\pi(x^2-y^2)\")\n    print(\"D) 0\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe correct option is {choice}.\")\n    \n    # Final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"<<<{choice}>>>\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the answer\nsolve_area_integral()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
