    "To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to understand how each mutation affects the protein produced by the gene. The most effective way to eliminate a protein's function is to introduce a change that either drastically alters its structure or, more definitively, prevents its complete synthesis. This is often achieved by a \"nonsense\" mutation, which introduces a premature stop codon, or a \"frameshift\" mutation, which scrambles the entire downstream amino acid sequence.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Define the Genetic Code**: We'll use a standard codon table to translate the DNA sequences into amino acid sequences.\n2.  **Translate Each Sequence**: We will translate the DNA sequence of the intact gene and each of the four mutants into their corresponding amino acid sequences. We will focus on the beginning of the gene where the mutations occurred.\n3.  **Analyze the Protein Changes**:\n    *   A **silent mutation** changes the DNA but not the amino acid, having no effect.\n    *   A **missense mutation** changes one amino acid for another. This might affect the protein's function, but it may not eliminate it.\n    *   A **nonsense mutation** changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon. This terminates protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n    *   A **frameshift mutation** (caused by an insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three) alters the reading frame, changing all subsequent amino acids and often leading to a premature stop codon.\n4.  **Identify the Most Disruptive Mutation**: We will compare the effects of each mutation. The one causing a premature stop codon is the most likely to achieve the desired outcome.\n\nLet's execute this plan with code.\n\n```python\ndef translate_dna(dna_sequence):\n    \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into a protein sequence.\"\"\"\n    genetic_code = {\n        'TTT': 'F', 'TTC': 'F', 'TTA': 'L', 'TTG': 'L',\n        'CTT': 'L', 'CTC': 'L', 'CTA': 'L', 'CTG': 'L',\n        'ATT': 'I', 'ATC': 'I', 'ATA': 'I', 'ATG': 'M',\n        'GTT': 'V', 'GTC': 'V', 'GTA': 'V', 'GTG': 'V',\n        'TCT': 'S', 'TCC': 'S', 'TCA': 'S', 'TCG': 'S',\n        'CCT': 'P', 'CCC': 'P', 'CCA': 'P', 'CCG': 'P',\n        'ACT': 'T', 'ACC': 'T', 'ACA': 'T', 'ACG': 'T',\n        'GCT': 'A', 'GCC': 'A', 'GCA': 'A', 'GCG': 'A',\n        'TAT': 'Y', 'TAC': 'Y', 'TAA': '*', 'TAG': '*',\n        'CAT': 'H', 'CAC': 'H', 'CAA': 'Q', 'CAG': 'Q',\n        'AAT': 'N', 'AAC': 'N', 'AAA': 'K', 'AAG': 'K',\n        'GAT': 'D', 'GAC': 'D', 'GAA': 'E', 'GAG': 'E',\n        'TGT': 'C', 'TGC': 'C', 'TGA': '*', 'TGG': 'W',\n        'CGT': 'R', 'CGC': 'R', 'CGA': 'R', 'CGG': 'R',\n        'AGT': 'S', 'AGC': 'S', 'AGA': 'R', 'AGG': 'R',\n        'GGT': 'G', 'GGC': 'G', 'GGA': 'G', 'GGG': 'G',\n    }\n    protein = []\n    # Process the sequence in codons (3 bases at a time)\n    for i in range(0, len(dna_sequence) - 2, 3):\n        codon = dna_sequence[i:i+3]\n        amino_acid = genetic_code.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown codon\n        if amino_acid == '*': # Stop codon\n            protein.append('STOP')\n            break\n        protein.append(amino_acid)\n    return \"-\".join(protein)\n\n# DNA sequences\nintact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\nmutant_1 = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\nmutant_2 = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\nmutant_3 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\nmutant_4 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\n# Translate and print the results for the first few amino acids\nprint(\"Analysis of Gene Mutations:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Intact Gene Protein: {translate_dna(intact_gene)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 1 Protein:    {translate_dna(mutant_1)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 2 Protein:    {translate_dna(mutant_2)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 3 Protein:    {translate_dna(mutant_3)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 4 Protein:    {translate_dna(mutant_4)}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"\\nExplanation:\")\nprint(\"Mutant 1 results in a missense mutation (L -> Y), which changes one amino acid.
