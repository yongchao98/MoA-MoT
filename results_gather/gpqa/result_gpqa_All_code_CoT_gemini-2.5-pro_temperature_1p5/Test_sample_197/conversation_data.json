    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n2.  **Define Species:** The cobalt-containing species are the free ion `Co²⁺` and the complexes `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)4]²⁻`.\n3.  **Use the Fraction Formula:** The fraction (α) of any given complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution is determined by the ligand concentration `[L]` and the stability constants `β`. The formula is:\n    `αₙ = (βₙ * [L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ * [L]ⁱ))`\n    The denominator is the sum of terms for all species, starting with `1` for the free metal ion (`β₀` is defined as 1).\n4.  **Apply to the Problem:**\n    *   We want to find the fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]`, so we are calculating `α₂`.\n    *   The ligand `L` is `SCN⁻`, and its concentration `[SCN⁻]` is 0.1 M.\n    *   The relevant stability constant for the numerator is `β₂ = 40`.\n    *   The denominator will be `1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴`.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Assigns the given stability constants and the thiocyanate concentration to variables.\n    *   Calculates the numerator term for `[Co(SCN)2]`.\n    *   Calculates the denominator by summing the terms for all five species.\n    *   Computes the fraction `α₂` by dividing the numerator by the denominator.\n    *   Converts the fraction to a percentage by multiplying by 100 and prints the final result.\n\n```python\n# Given values\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Thiocyanate ligand concentration in M\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The distribution of complexes depends on the ligand concentration and stability constants.\n# The fraction of a specific complex [Co(SCN)n]^(2-n) is given by:\n# alpha_n = (beta_n * [SCN-]^n) / (1 + beta_1*[SCN-] + beta_2*[SCN-]^2 + beta_3*[SCN-]^3 + beta_4*[SCN-]^4)\n# We want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which corresponds to n=2.\n\n# Calculate the terms for the denominator sum. The term for the free Co(II) ion (n=0) is 1.\nterm0 = 1  # For free Co^2+\nterm1 = beta1 * (scn_conc ** 1)\nterm2 = beta2 * (scn_conc ** 2)  # This is also the numerator for our target species\nterm3 = beta3 * (scn_conc ** 3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (scn_conc ** 4)\n\n# The numerator is the term for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2)\nnumerator = term2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of terms for all species\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\n# Print the result rounded to one decimal place to match the options\nprint(f\"The percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: {percentage:.1f}%\")\n\n# The available options are:\n# A) 38.1%\n# B) 42.3%\n# C) 16.9%\n# D) 25.6%\n# Our calculated value of 16.9% matches option C.\nprint(\"Choice A: 38.1%\")\nprint(\"Choice B: 42.3%\")\nprint(\"Choice C: 16.9%\")\nprint(\"Choice D: 25.6%\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
