    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Understand the relationship between parallax and distance.** Parallax (plx) is defined as the inverse of the distance (r) to a star, so `plx = 1/r`.\n2.  **Express the number of stars in terms of distance.** The problem states that the number of stars (N) is proportional to `1/plx^5`. We can substitute the relationship from step 1 into this expression: `N ∝ 1/(1/r)^5`, which simplifies to `N ∝ r^5`. This means the *total* number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n3.  **Find the number of stars per unit distance.** The question asks how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*, which is mathematically represented by the derivative of the number of stars with respect to distance, `dN/dr`.\n4.  **Differentiate the expression.** We need to differentiate the proportionality `N ∝ r^5` with respect to `r`. If we write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality `k` (i.e., `N = k * r^5`), the derivative is `dN/dr = d/dr(k * r^5) = 5 * k * r^4`.\n5.  **Determine the final proportionality.** Since `5*k` is just another constant, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`. This corresponds to option B.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic differentiation and confirm this result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# --- Plan ---\n# 1. Define the relationship between the total number of stars (N) and distance (r).\n#    We are given N ~ 1/plx^5. Since parallax plx = 1/r, we have:\n#    N ~ 1/(1/r)^5  =>  N ~ r^5.\n#    Let's represent this with a constant of proportionality, k: N = k * r^5.\n\n# 2. Find the number of stars per unit range of distance by taking the derivative of N with respect to r (dN/dr).\n\n# 3. Analyze the result to find the proportionality.\n\n# --- Execution ---\n\n# Define symbolic variables for distance 'r' and a constant 'k'.\nr = sp.Symbol('r')\nk = sp.Symbol('k')\n\n# Define the expression for the total number of stars N as a function of r.\nN = k * r**5\nprint(f\"The total number of stars out to a distance r is proportional to r^5.\")\nprint(f\"We can write this relationship as: N = {N}\")\n\n# Calculate the derivative of N with respect to r. This gives us the number of stars per unit range of distance.\ndN_dr = sp.diff(N, r)\nprint(f\"\\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance is the derivative, dN/dr.\")\nprint(f\"dN/dr = {dN_dr}\")\n\n# From the result, we can see the proportionality.\n# Since 5*k is a constant, dN/dr is proportional to r^4.\nprint(f\"\\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4.\")\n\n# Match the result to the given options.\n# A) ~ r^5\n# B) ~ r^4\n# C) ~ r^2\n# D) ~ r^3\nfinal_choice = 'B'\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, the correct choice is: {final_choice}\")\n\n# <<<B>>>\n```"
