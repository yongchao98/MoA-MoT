    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the predicted 1H NMR spectra for each of the possible compounds and then see which 1:1 mixture would produce the spectrum described.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the given NMR data:**\n    *   Molecular Formula: C10H14 for both compounds.\n    *   Aromatic region: Two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio. This means each compound in the 1:1 mixture must contribute one aromatic singlet, and each of these singlets must correspond to the same number of protons.\n    *   Aliphatic region: Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integral ratio. These signals must arise from the methyl/ethyl groups of the two compounds combined.\n\n2.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate molecule:**\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to high symmetry, it will show one singlet for the two aromatic protons (H-3, H-6) and one singlet for the twelve protons of the four equivalent methyl groups.\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** Due to a single plane of symmetry, it will show one singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons (H-4, H-6) and three singlets for the methyl groups (one for 6H from Me-1 and Me-3, one for 3H from Me-2, and one for 3H from Me-5), with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** Due to symmetry, it will show one singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons (H-5, H-6) and two singlets for the methyl groups (one for 6H from Me-1 and Me-4, and one for 6H from Me-2 and Me-3), with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** It will show one singlet for the four equivalent aromatic protons. The ethyl groups will show a quartet (for the 4H of the two CH2 groups) and a triplet (for the 6H of the two CH3 groups). The presence of a quartet and triplet rules this compound out, as the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on a 1:1 mixture:**\n    *   We will combine the predicted spectra for the compounds in each option and compare the result to the experimental data.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes potential compounds to match a given 1H NMR spectrum of a mixture.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the problem based on the 1H NMR data for a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\")\n    print(\"Experimental Data:\")\n    print(\"- Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"- Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): 3 singlets, 2:1:1 ratio.\\n\")\n\n    # Predicted spectra for individual compounds\n    spectra = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"Aromatic H\": \"1 singlet (2H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic H\": \"1 singlet (12H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic Signals\": 1,\n            \"Aliphatic Integrals\": [12]\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"Aromatic H\": \"1 singlet (2H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic H\": \"3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H -> ratio 2:1:1)\",\n            \"Aliphatic Signals\": 3,\n            \"Aliphatic Integrals\": [6, 3, 3]\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"Aromatic H\": \"1 singlet (2H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic H\": \"2 singlets (6H, 6H -> ratio 1:1)\",\n            \"Aliphatic Signals\": 2,\n            \"Aliphatic Integrals\": [6, 6]\n        },\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\n            \"Aromatic H\": \"1 singlet (4H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic H\": \"1 quartet (4H) and 1 triplet (6H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic Signals\": \"Non-singlets\",\n            \"Aliphatic Integrals\": []\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Predicted spectra for individual compounds:\")\n    for compound, spec in spectra.items():\n        print(f\"- {compound}:\")\n        print(f\"  Aromatic: {spec['Aromatic H']}\")\n        print(f\"  Aliphatic: {spec['Aliphatic H']}\")\n    print(\"\\nNote: 1,4-diethylbenzene is ruled out as it produces non-singlet signals (a quartet and a triplet) in the aliphatic region.\\n\")\n\n    # Options Analysis\n    options = {\n        \"A\": [\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"],\n        \"B\": [\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\"],\n        \"C\": [\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"],\n        \"D\": [\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"]\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluating the options for a 1:1 mixture:\")\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, compounds in options.items():\n        print(f\"--- Option {option}: {compounds[0]} and {compounds[1]} ---\")\n        \n        # Check if any compound is invalid\n        if spectra[compounds[0]]['Aliphatic Signals'] == 'Non-singlets' or spectra[compounds[1]]['Aliphatic Signals'] == 'Non-singlets':\n            print(\"Result: Does not match.
