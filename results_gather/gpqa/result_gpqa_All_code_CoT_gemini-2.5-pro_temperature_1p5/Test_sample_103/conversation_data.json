    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The periodic shift in a star's spectral line (Doppler shift) is caused by the star \"wobbling\" due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). Therefore, the amplitude of the wavelength shift is proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (which is called the RV semi-amplitude, K).\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   This means `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n3.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the orbital period (T), the star's mass (M_star), and the planet's mass (m_p) by the formula:\n    *   `K ∝ m_p / (M_star^(2/3) * T^(1/3))`\n4.  **Simplify the Relation:** The problem states that the masses of the two stars are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the masses of the two planets are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). Therefore, the terms for the masses cancel out when we take a ratio, and the relationship simplifies to:\n    *   `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)`\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio (T₂/T₁):** We can rearrange the simplified proportion to solve for T:\n    *   `T^(1/3) ∝ 1 / K`\n    *   `T ∝ 1 / K³`\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the periods is: `T₂ / T₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³`.\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Substitute the values for the wavelength shifts into the equation.\n    *   `T₂ / T₁ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ )³ = (5 / 7)³`\n7.  **Select the Correct Option:** Compare the calculated numerical value with the given choices.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the given wavelength shifts in miliangstroms.\ndelta_lambda_1 = 5  # for planet #1\ndelta_lambda_2 = 7  # for planet #2\n\n# Step 2: The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1/K2) is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\n# K1/K2 = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\nk_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Step 3: The orbital period (T) is inversely proportional to the cube of the RV semi-amplitude (K),\n# assuming star and planet masses are constant for both systems.\n# T is proportional to 1 / K^3\n# Therefore, T2 / T1 = K1^3 / K2^3 = (K1 / K2)^3\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1.\nperiod_ratio_T2_over_T1 = k_ratio ** 3\n\n# Step 5: The provided options are:\n# A) ~ 0.85\n# B) ~ 1.40\n# C) ~ 0.36\n# D) ~ 1.96\n\n# The calculated value corresponds to option C.\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio T2/T1 is: {period_ratio_T2_over_T1:.2f}\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option C.\")\nprint(\"The answer is C\")\n\n<<<C>>>\n```"
