    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information Provided:** I'll break down the spectroscopic data to identify the structural fragments of the molecule.\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells me the core structure is a benzene ring (C6) with two other groups attached.\n    *   **FTIR: Ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. This means the molecular formula must contain two oxygen atoms, which all the options do.\n    *   **1H NMR Signal Analysis:**\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** On a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four ring protons strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is C6H4.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) and one -CH3 signal:** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`. The H next to the ring is split by the other vinyl H and the methyl group (doublet of quartets), and the terminal vinyl H is split only by the other vinyl H (doublet). This fragment consists of C3H5.\n        *   **A second -CH3 signal:** We've already accounted for one methyl group in the propenyl fragment. The ester group is `R-COO-R'`. The second methyl group signal, combined with the fact that there are *no* `-CH2-` signals, points to the `R'` part of the ester being a simple methyl group. Thus, we have a methyl ester, `-COOCH3`. This fragment adds C1, H3, and O2 to the part of the ester that is not the methyl group itself.\n        *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint that confirms the methyl ester idea. If it were an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), for example, we would see a -CH2- signal.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:** Now, I will put all the identified pieces together and sum up the atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** `C6H4`\n    *   **Substituent 1 (Propenyl group):** `-CH=CH-CH3` which is `C3H5`\n    *   **Substituent 2 (Methyl ester group):** `-COOCH3` which is `C2H3O2`\n\n    Let's sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from methyl ester)\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n3.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) C11H12O2\n    *   B) C12H14O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C11H14O2\n\n    My calculated formula, C11H12O2, perfectly matches option A.\n\n4.  **Final Code Generation:** I will write a Python script that programmatically represents this deduction process. The code will define the atoms in each fragment and sum them to determine the final formula, then select the correct option.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Identify molecular fragments based on spectroscopic data.\n# 2. Define the atomic composition (C, H, O) for each fragment.\n# 3. Sum the atoms from all fragments to get the final molecular formula.\n# 4. Compare the result with the given choices and print the correct one.\n\n# Fragment 1: para-di-substituted aromatic ring\n# The ring itself has 6 carbons.
