    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the major isomer of product 3.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** Cyclooctatetraene (COT) first undergoes a thermal electrocyclic reaction to form its valence isomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This isomer is a suitable diene for a Diels-Alder reaction. It then reacts with the dienophile, maleic anhydride. Diels-Alder reactions under kinetic control (heating is typical) favor the *endo* adduct due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. This initial *endo* addition is a key stereochemical step.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** The anhydride in Product 1 is treated with methanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a Fischer esterification which opens the anhydride ring and converts both carboxylic acid groups into methyl esters. This reaction does not affect the stereocenters of the carbon framework. Therefore, the *cis* relationship from the maleic anhydride is preserved, resulting in a *cis*-diester.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 3:** Product 2 undergoes a second Diels-Alder reaction with cyclopentadiene. We must consider two aspects of stereoselectivity here:\n    *   **Facial Selectivity:** The double bond in Product 2 that acts as the dienophile is part of a bridged system. The incoming diene (cyclopentadiene) will preferentially attack from the less sterically hindered face.\n    *   ***Endo/Exo* Selectivity:** As in the first Diels-Alder reaction, the kinetic product will be the *endo* adduct, where the diene orients itself to maximize secondary orbital overlap with the dienophile's substituents.\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:** Based on the predicted stereochemical outcomes of these three reactions, we will analyze the four provided structures to identify the one that matches the major kinetic product.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# rdkit is a powerful cheminformatics library. We can use it to help visualize and confirm the structures,\n# but the logic can be derived from chemical principles alone.\n# The following explanation relies on these well-established principles of stereoselectivity in pericyclic reactions.\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\nexcept ImportError:\n    # rdkit is not essential for the logical deduction but is helpful for verification.\n    # The explanation provided will stand on its own chemical principles.\n    pass\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function encapsulates the step-by-step reasoning to identify the correct product structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n\n    print(\"\\n1.

Options C and D show an 'anti' relationship, which would arise from a disfavored 'exo' cycloaddition. Thus, C and D are unlikely to be the major product.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n2.
