    "Here is my step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol (using the most common isotope, ³⁵Cl).\n*   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of about 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This ~3:1 ratio of M+ to M+2 is a classic isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule (since the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75% and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n*   All four options (C₇H₅ClO₂) have a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with this finding.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, where the broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This specific frequency falls nicely within the range for a carboxylic acid's carbonyl group.\n*   Conclusion from IR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates options C (phenyl chloroformate) and D (aldehyde), as they do not have a carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is the defining peak for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It's a singlet because it typically does not couple with other protons. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons (for a total of four aromatic protons), is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution results in only two unique types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Remaining Options**\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted (1,2-disubstituted) ring. Due to the lack of symmetry, it would produce a more complex splitting pattern for its four aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) ring. This structure has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom. It perfectly matches all the data:\n    *   It contains one Cl atom (MS).\n    *   It is a carboxylic acid (IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR peak).\n    *   It is para-substituted, which would give two doublets in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nBased on the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectral data to identify an unknown compound from a list of options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Provided Data\n    mass_spec = {\n        'm/z=156': '100% (M+ peak)',\n        'm/z=158': '32% (M+2 peak)'\n    }\n    ir_spec = {\n        '3500-2700 cm-1': 'broad peak',\n        '1720 cm-1': 'strong sharp peak'\n    }\n    nmr_spec = {\n        '11.0 ppm': 'singlet, 1H',\n        '8.02 ppm': 'doublet, 2H',\n        '7.72 ppm': 'doublet, 2H'\n    }\n\n    # Options\n    options = {\n        'A': '2-chlorobenzoic acid',\n        'B': '4-chlorobenzoic acid',\n        'C': 'Phenyl chloroformate',\n        'D': '3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-Step Analysis:\")\n    \n    # --- Analysis ---\n    print(\"\\n1.
