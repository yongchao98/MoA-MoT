    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data (IR and ¹H NMR) to Determine the Structure of the Starting Material, Compound X.**\n    *   The IR spectrum shows a very broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ and a sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This combination is characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   The ¹H NMR signal at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H) further confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid proton.\n    *   The ¹H NMR signals in the aromatic region, two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H), indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The remaining signals describe the alkyl substituent: `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`, `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`, `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`, and `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`. Piecing these fragments together reveals a sec-butyl group, -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   Therefore, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Predict the Final Product.**\n    *   The reagent is red phosphorus and HI (hydriodic acid). This is a powerful reducing agent.\n    *   This reagent combination is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a benzene ring to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The alkyl group (sec-butyl) and the benzene ring itself are not affected by this reaction.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Final Product.**\n    *   The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is reduced at the carboxylic acid position.\n    *   The -COOH group becomes a -CH₃ group.\n    *   The final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n4.  **Match the Final Product with the Given Options.**\n    *   Comparing the deduced product, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, with the provided choices, it matches option D.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze spectroscopic data to identify Compound X.\nir_data = \"3400–2500 cm-1 (broad, O-H of COOH), 1720 cm-1 (C=O of COOH), 1610/1450 cm-1 (aromatic C=C)\"\nnmr_data = {\n    \"10.5 ppm\": \"bs, 1H, -COOH proton\",\n    \"8.0 ppm\": \"d, 2H, aromatic protons ortho to COOH\",\n    \"7.2 ppm\": \"d, 2H, aromatic protons ortho to alkyl group\",\n    \"2.9 ppm\": \"m, 1H, -CH- (methine) of sec-butyl\",\n    \"1.7 ppm\": \"m, 2H, -CH2- of sec-butyl\",\n    \"1.4 ppm\": \"d, 3H, -CH3 doublet of sec-butyl\",\n    \"0.9 ppm\": \"t, 3H, -CH3 triplet of sec-butyl\"\n}\n# The data points to a para-disubstituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group\n# and a sec-butyl group.\ncompound_x = \"4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\"\n\n# Step 2: Identify the reaction.\nreagent = \"Red phosphorus and HI\"\nreaction_type = \"Strong reduction of a carboxylic acid to an alkane.\"\n\n# Step 3: Predict the final product.\n# The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n# The rest of the molecule (the sec-butyl group and the benzene ring) remains unchanged.\nproduct_name = \"1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\"\n\n# Step 4: Compare the predicted product with the given options.\noptions = {\n    'A': '1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene',\n    'B': '2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid',\n    'C': '4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid',  # This is the starting material, Compound X\n    'D': '1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene'\n}\n\n# Determine the correct choice\ncorrect_choice = ''\nfor choice, name in options.items():\n    if name == product_name:\n        correct_choice = choice\n        break\n\n# Final Output\nprint(\"Analysis Summary:\")\nprint(f\"1.
