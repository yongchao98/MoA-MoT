    "To determine the correct IUPAC name, we need to follow a systematic approach by deconstructing the molecule's description and applying IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n**1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Structure:**\nThe highest priority functional group mentioned is the carboxylic acid (-COOH). When attached to a benzene ring, it forms the parent structure, **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as position **1**.\n\n**2. Place the Substituents based on relative positions:**\n*   **Para to -COOH (C1):** A methoxy group (-OCH3) is at the para position, which is **C4**.\n*   **Ortho to -COOH (C1):** A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are at the ortho positions, which are **C2** and **C6**.\n*   **Meta to -COOH (C1):** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as \"formyl\") and a cyano (-CN) group are at the meta positions, which are **C3** and **C5**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Resolve Ambiguities:**\nThe description states that the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are both ortho to the cyano group (-CN).\n*   **Case A:** If the cyano group is at **C3**, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since the methoxy group is already at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This is a consistent arrangement.\n*   **Case B:** If the cyano group is at **C5**, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since the methoxy group is at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This is also a consistent arrangement.\n\n**4. Apply the Lowest Locant Rule:**\nWe now have two possible structures. To decide between them, IUPAC rules state that we should number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants to the substituents, listed alphabetically.\nThe substituents are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n\nLet's analyze the locants in both cases:\n*   **Structure from Case A:**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n    *   The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\", which gets locant **3**.\n\n*   **Structure from Case B:**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n    *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\", which gets locant **5**.\n\nThe rule is to assign the lowest number at the first point of difference. Since 3 < 5, the numbering from **Case A** is correct.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Name:**\nUsing the structure from Case A, we list the substituents in alphabetical order with their correct locants:\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\nCombining these with the parent name gives: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option B.\n\n```python\ndef solve_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule\n    by systematically applying nomenclature rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1-3: Deduce the structure and resolve ambiguities.\n    # From the reasoning, two possible structures arise.
