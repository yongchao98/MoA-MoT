    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  Identify the quantum numbers of the initial state of the two-electron system. The state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. So, we have $l_1=1$, $l_2=1$, $l=2$, and $m=-1$.\n2.  Identify the quantum numbers of the final state we are measuring. A measurement of the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for the z-component of angular momentum ($L_z$) corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_z = -1$. We want this outcome for both electrons, so the final state has $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n3.  Apply the fundamental conservation rule for the coupling of angular momentum. The total magnetic quantum number $m$ must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, i.e., $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n4.  Check if this condition is met. The initial state has $m=-1$. The state we are measuring has a total magnetic quantum number of $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n5.  Since the total $m$ of the initial state (-1) is not equal to the sum of the individual $m$ values of the final state (-2), the transition is forbidden. In the language of quantum mechanics, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transformation, $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$, is zero.\n6.  The probability is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient, which is $0^2 = 0$.\n7.
