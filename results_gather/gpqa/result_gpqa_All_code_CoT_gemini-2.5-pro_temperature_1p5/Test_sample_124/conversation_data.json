    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Energy Formula:** The potential is $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$, which corresponds to a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the principal quantum number.\n\n2.  **Determine the Quantum Number for the Third Excited State:**\n    *   The ground state corresponds to $n=0$.\n    *   The first excited state corresponds to $n=1$.\n    *   The second excited state corresponds to $n=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the third excited state corresponds to $n=3$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State:** Substitute $n=3$ into the energy formula:\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = (\\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:** The degeneracy, which is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level, is the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ that sum to $n$. The formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the $n$-th level is $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.\n    *   For the third excited state ($n=3$), the degeneracy is:\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:** The calculated energy is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy is 10. This matches option B.\n\nNow, I will write Python code to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_harmonic_oscillator_state(excited_state_level):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energy and degeneracy for a given excited state of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n    Args:\n        excited_state_level (int): The level of the excited state (e.g., 0 for ground, 1 for first excited, etc.).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The principal quantum number 'n' corresponds to the excited state level.\n    n = excited_state_level\n\n    # Calculate the energy. The formula is E_n = (n + 3/2) * hbar * omega.\n    # We will represent the energy factor (n + 3/2) as a fraction.\n    energy_numerator = 2 * n + 3\n    energy_denominator = 2\n    energy_str = f\"({energy_numerator}/{energy_denominator}) hbar omega\"\n\n    # Calculate the degeneracy. The formula is g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2.\n    degeneracy = (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 2\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"For the third excited state (n={n}):\")\n    print(f\"The energy is {energy_str}.\")\n    print(f\"The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is {degeneracy}.\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\n    print(f\"A) 11 pi^2 hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\")\n    print(f\"B) (9/2) hbar omega, 10\")\n    print(f\"C) (9/2) hbar omega, 3\")\n    print(f\"D) 11 pi^2 hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculated energy and degeneracy match option B.\")\n\n# The problem asks for the third excited state.\n# Ground state is n=0, First excited is n=1, Second excited is n=2, Third excited is n=3.\nsolve_harmonic_oscillator_state(3)\n\n# The final answer is B.\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer Selection:\")\nprint(\"B\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
