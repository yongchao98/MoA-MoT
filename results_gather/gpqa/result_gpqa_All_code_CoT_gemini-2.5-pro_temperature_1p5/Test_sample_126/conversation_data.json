    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene.\n    *   **Parent chain:** \"nona\" indicates a 9-carbon chain.\n    *   **Unsaturation:** \"-2,6-diene\" indicates two double bonds, starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n    *   **Substituent:** \"5-butyl\" indicates a butyl group (-C4H9) attached to carbon 5.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH=CH-CH2-CH(C4H9)-CH=CH-CH2-CH3`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** Heating a molecule with a 1,5-diene system strongly suggests a pericyclic reaction, specifically a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement. A 1,5-diene has two double bonds separated by three single bonds. Let's find this system in our molecule.\n\n3.  **Locate the 1,5-Diene System:** The core system that will undergo rearrangement involves the six carbons from C2 to C7:\n    `C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7`\n    This is a classic 1,5-diene structure.\n\n4.  **Simulate the Cope Rearrangement:** In a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement:\n    *   The sigma bond between atoms 3 and 4 of the system breaks. In our case, this is the **C4-C5 bond**.\n    *   A new sigma bond forms between atoms 1 and 6. In our case, this is the **C2-C7 bond**.\n    *   The double bonds shift: The C2=C3 bond moves to **C3=C4**, and the C6=C7 bond moves to **C5=C6**.\n\n5.  **Trace the Atoms and Substituents:** Let's see what is attached to each of the six carbons in the rearranging system and track them to the product.\n    *   **C2** has a methyl group (`-CH3`, which is C1 of the original chain).\n    *   **C3** has a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **C4** has two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **C5** has a hydrogen atom and a butyl group (`-C4H9`).\n    *   **C6** has a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **C7** has a hydrogen atom and an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`, which are C8 and C9).\n\n6.  **Construct the Product Structure:** Let's assemble the new molecule based on the new connections:\n    *   The new backbone is `C4=C3-C2-C7-C6=C5`.\n    *   Attaching the groups: `(H2)C4=(H)C3 - (H,CH3)C2 - (H,C2H5)C7 - (H)C6=(H,C4H9)C5`\n    *   Written out linearly, this gives the structure: `CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(C2H5)-CH=CH(C4H9)`\n    *   To be clear, `=CH(C4H9)` means the carbon atom is part of a double bond and is also attached to a hydrogen and a butyl group (`-CH2CH2CH2CH3`).\n\n7.  **Name the Product:** To find the IUPAC name, we find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the double bonds.\n    *   The chain is: `CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH-CH2CH2CH2CH3`.\n    *   The longest chain has 10 carbon atoms (deca-).\n    *   We number the chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the left gives the double bonds at positions 1 and 5. Numbering from the right would give them higher numbers.\n    *   So, the parent name is **deca-1,5-diene**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group on carbon 3 and an ethyl group on carbon 4.\n    *   Arranging the substituents alphabetically, the full name is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated name, 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene, matches option D.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks to identify the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n# Heating a 1,5-diene typically induces a Cope rearrangement, which is a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift.\n\n# Step 1: Define the starting molecule and the options.\nstart_molecule = \"5-butylnona-2,6-diene\"\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\",\n    \"B\": \"5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\",\n    \"C\": \"5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\",\n    \"D\": \"4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\"\n}\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the reaction.
