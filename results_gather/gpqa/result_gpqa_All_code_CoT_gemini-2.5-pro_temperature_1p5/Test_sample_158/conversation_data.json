    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the comoving distance to the quasar:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:** The observation of a sharp drop in flux at a specific wavelength is a key indicator of a redshifted astrophysical feature. In the context of a high-redshift quasar, this drop is almost certainly the Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) break. This break is caused by the absorption of the quasar's light by the neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at wavelengths shorter than the redshifted Ly-α emission line.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):** The redshift relates the observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) to the rest-frame emitted wavelength (`λ_emit`).\n    *   The rest-frame wavelength of the Ly-α line is `λ_emit` = 121.6 nm.\n    *   The observed wavelength of the break is `λ_obs` = 790 nm.\n    *   The redshift `z` is calculated using the formula: `z = (λ_obs / λ_emit) - 1`.\n\n3.  **Use the Cosmological Model to Find Distance:** With the redshift `z` known, we can calculate the comoving distance `Dc`. For the given flat Lambda-CDM model, the formula is:\n    `Dc = (c / H0) * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')`\n    where:\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `H0` is the Hubble constant.\n    *   `E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m,0 * (1+z)³ + Ω_Λ,0)`, where `Ω_m,0` is the matter density parameter and `Ω_Λ,0` is the dark energy density parameter.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:**\n    *   Define the constants for the calculation (`λ_obs`, `λ_emit`, `H0`, `c`, `Ω_m,0`, `Ω_Λ,0`).\n    *   Calculate the redshift `z`.\n    *   Use a numerical integration library, like `scipy.integrate.quad`, to compute the integral.\n    *   Calculate the comoving distance `Dc`, which will be in Megaparsecs (Mpc), and then convert it to Gigaparsecs (Gpc).\n    *   Compare the calculated distance to the provided options (A, B, C, D) and select the closest one.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_quasar_distance():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the comoving distance to a quasar based on its observed spectrum\n    and a given cosmological model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define physical constants and observational data.\n    # The flux drop at 790 nm corresponds to the redshifted Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) line.\n    lambda_observed = 790.0  # Observed wavelength of Ly-α break in nm\n    lambda_emitted = 121.6   # Rest-frame wavelength of Ly-α line in nm\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the redshift (z).\n    z = (lambda_observed / lambda_emitted) - 1\n\n    # Step 3: Define the cosmological parameters for the Lambda-CDM model.\n    H0 = 70.0      # Hubble constant in km s^-1 Mpc^-1\n    Omega_m0 = 0.3   # Matter density parameter\n    Omega_L0 = 0.7   # Dark energy density parameter\n    c = 299792.458 # Speed of light in km/s\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the comoving distance.\n    # The comoving distance Dc for a flat universe is calculated by integrating.\n    # We define the integrand for the comoving distance integral.\n    def integrand(z_prime):\n        return 1.0 / np.sqrt(Omega_m0 * (1 + z_prime)**3 + Omega_L0)\n\n    # Perform the numerical integration from z=0 to the calculated redshift.\n    integral_result, _ = quad(integrand, 0, z)\n\n    # Calculate the comoving distance in Megaparsecs (Mpc).\n    Dc_Mpc = (c / H0) * integral_result\n\n    # Convert the distance from Mpc to Gigaparsecs (Gpc).\n    Dc_Gpc = Dc_Mpc / 1000.0\n\n    # Step 5: Compare the result to the given options to find the closest one.\n    options = {'A': 7, 'B': 8, 'C': 9, 'D': 6}\n    differences = {label: abs(Dc_Gpc - value) for label, value in options.items()}\n    closest_option_label = min(differences, key=differences.get)\n\n    print(f\"The calculated redshift of the quasar is: {z:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"The comoving distance to the quasar is: {Dc_Gpc:.2f} Gpc.\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing this result to the given options:\")\n    print(\"A) 7 Gpc\")\n    print(\"B) 8 Gpc\")\n    print(\"C) 9 Gpc\")\n    print(\"D) 6 Gpc\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated distance is closest to option {closest_option_label}.\")\n\n    # Returning the final answer in the required format\n    return f\"<<<{closest_option_label}>>>\"\n\n# Run the function and print the final answer\nfinal_answer = solve_quasar_distance()\nprint(final_answer)\n\n```"
