    "Here is my plan to solve this titration problem:\n1.  **Dilution Calculation:** First, I will calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after it's diluted with water using the formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:** This point is in the buffer region of the titration. I will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid]).\n    *   I'll first calculate the pKa from the given Ka.\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains. The ratio [conjugate base]/[acid] is therefore 25/75, or 1/3.\n3.  **pH at Equivalence Point:** At this point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-). The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n    *   I will calculate the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point, considering the total volume.\n    *   I'll find the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate using the relation Kw = Ka * Kb, where Kw is the ion product of water (1.0 x 10^-14 at 25°C).\n    *   I will then calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH-] produced by the hydrolysis.\n    *   From [OH-], I can find the pOH, and finally the pH using the formula pH = 14.00 - pOH.\n4.  **Final Output:** I will print the calculated pH values and identify the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given constants and initial values ---\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\nV_acid_initial = 20.00 / 1000  # Initial volume of acetic acid in L\nC_acid_initial = 0.05         # Initial concentration of acetic acid in M\nV_water_added = 20.00 / 1000   # Volume of water added in L\nC_naoh = 0.1                  # Concentration of NaOH titrant in M\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid ---\nV_acid_final = V_acid_initial + V_water_added\n# Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution (M1V1 = M2V2)\nC_acid_final = (C_acid_initial * V_acid_initial) / V_acid_final\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# Calculate pKa from Ka\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75 = 1/3\nratio_A_HA = 0.25 / (1 - 0.25)\n# Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_A_HA)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Calculate initial moles of acid\nmoles_acid = C_acid_final * V_acid_final\n\n# Calculate volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point\nV_naoh_eq = moles_acid / C_naoh\n\n# Total volume at the equivalence point\nV_total_eq = V_acid_final + V_naoh_eq\n\n# At the equivalence point, all acid is converted to its conjugate base (acetate)\n# The concentration of acetate is the initial moles of acid in the new total volume.\nC_acetate = moles_acid / V_total_eq\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate from Ka and Kw\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka\n\n# The acetate hydrolyzes: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n# We calculate [OH-] from Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-].
