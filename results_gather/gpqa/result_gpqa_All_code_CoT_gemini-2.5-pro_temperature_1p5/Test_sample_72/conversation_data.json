    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel):** We will use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, as both astronauts are moving in the same direction in the same reference frame. The formula is:\n    `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n    where `v1 = 0.6c` and `v2 = 0.5c`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E):** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of a particle is given by `E = γ * m_rest * c^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n    *   First, we'll calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ1`) and energy (`E1`) for the first astronaut (`m1 = 2m`, `v1 = 0.6c`).\n    *   Next, we'll calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ2`) and energy (`E2`) for the second astronaut (`m2 = 3m`, `v2 = 0.5c`).\n    *   Finally, we will sum the two energies to find the total energy of the system: `E_total = E1 + E2`.\n\n3.  **Compare and Conclude:** We will compare our calculated values for relative speed and total energy with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given values in terms of m and c\nm1_m = 2.0  # Mass of astronaut 1 in units of m\nv1_c = 0.6  # Speed of astronaut 1 in units of c\nm2_m = 3.0  # Mass of astronaut 2 in units of m\nv2_c = 0.5  # Speed of astronaut 2 in units of c\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the relative speed\n# The formula for relative velocity is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2/c^2).\n# We can calculate the relative speed in terms of c directly.\nv_rel_c = (v1_c - v2_c) / (1 - v1_c * v2_c)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total energy of the system\n# The total energy is E = gamma * m_rest * c^2, where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).\n# The total energy of the system is E_total = E1 + E2.\n\n# Energy of astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1_c**2)\nE1_mc2 = gamma1 * m1_m  # Energy in units of mc^2\n\n# Energy of astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2_c**2)\nE2_mc2 = gamma2 * m2_m  # Energy in units of mc^2\n\n# Total energy of the system\nE_total_mc2 = E1_mc2 + E2_mc2\n\n# Step 3: Print the results and the final choice\nprint(\"--- Calculated Values ---\")\nprint(f\"Relative speed: v_rel = {v_rel_c:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"Total energy: E = {E_total_mc2:.2f}mc^2\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Comparing with Options ---\")\nprint(\"A) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\")\nprint(\"B) v_rel = 0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\")\nprint(\"C) v_rel = 0.14c, E= 5mc^2\")\nprint(\"D) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated values match option A.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: A\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
