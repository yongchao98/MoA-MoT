    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is ~277 K (4°C). This is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82°C (276.97 K). The heavier isotope mentioned in the prompt is likely Deuterium (D), the isotope of Hydrogen. So, B is D₂O.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance G:** G is a precipitate that releases B (D₂O) upon heating. This suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide, likely Al(OD)₃, which upon heating decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance Y and Gas W:** The reaction of X and Y produces a precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) and a gas W. The reaction is violent, typical of a strong reducing agent with a protic solvent. For the product to be Al(OD)₃, the reactants must contain Al and D. Y is the source of the OD group, so Y is likely D₂O (liquid heavy water).\n    The reaction would be: X + D₂O → Al(OD)₃ + ...\n    Gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's test D₂ gas (Deuterium gas). Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** Based on the above, X is a powerful reducing agent containing Aluminum and Deuterium. The reaction with a keto acid producing a product with 2 oxygens (reduction of both keto and carboxylic acid groups) points strongly to a reagent like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Since the substance contains Deuterium, it must be the deuterated analog: Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   Let's check the reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W). This reaction is consistent with all the clues.\n    *   The \"close analog\" used in organic chemistry is LiAlH₄.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Value:**\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   The atomic mass numbers for the relevant isotopes are: D ≈ 2, Li ≈ 7, Al ≈ 27.\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (D).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The problem asks for the sum of the masses of *all instances* of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   In LiAlD₄, there are four atoms of the lightest element (D). Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   There is one atom of the heaviest element (Al). Total mass = 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative mass = (mass of all D atoms) + (mass of all Al atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B. Now, we'll implement this calculation in Python.\n\n```python\n# Based on the chemical puzzle, Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D), an isotope of Hydrogen.\n\n# Atomic mass numbers of the relevant isotopes:\n# Deuterium (D) is the lightest element present. Mass number = 2.\n# Lithium (Li). Mass number = 7.\n# Aluminum (Al) is the heaviest element present. Mass number = 27.\n\n# The formula of Substance X is LiAlD4.\n# Number of atoms of the lightest element (Deuterium) in the molecule.\ncount_lightest_element = 4\nmass_lightest_element = 2\n\n# Number of atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminum) in the molecule.\ncount_heaviest_element = 1\nmass_heaviest_element = 27\n\n# Calculate the total mass of all instances of the lightest element.\ntotal_mass_lightest = count_lightest_element * mass_lightest_element\n\n# Calculate the total mass of all instances of the heaviest element.\ntotal_mass_heaviest = count_heaviest_element * mass_heaviest_element\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass as requested.\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_lightest + total_mass_heaviest\n\n# Print the final result and the corresponding choice.\nprint(f\"The lightest element is Deuterium (D), and the heaviest is Aluminum (Al).\")\nprint(f\"Total mass of the four Deuterium atoms: 4 * 2 = {total_mass_lightest}\")\nprint(f\"Total mass of the one Aluminum atom: 1 * 27 = {total_mass_heaviest}\")\nprint(f\"The cumulative mass is {total_mass_lightest} + {total_mass_heaviest} = {cumulative_mass}.\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to choice B.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
