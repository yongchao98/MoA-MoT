    "My thinking process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2 is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):** First, I'll calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds. The formula for DBE is `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`. For C9H11NO2, this is `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (like C=O), which accounts for the fifth.\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two medium-to-strong bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It's too high for a simple amide C=O (which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 hydrogens indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is the first part of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 hydrogens indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-). This is the second part of an ethyl group. The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) means this -CH₂- is attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen. Together, the triplet and quartet strongly suggest an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 hydrogens is characteristic of the protons on a primary amine (-NH₂). Their signal is often broad due to chemical exchange and quadrupole coupling with the nitrogen.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents are different electronically, causing the two sets of aromatic protons to have different chemical shifts.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   From the DBE and NMR, we have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   From the IR and NMR, we have a primary amine (-NH₂) substituent.\n    *   From the IR and NMR, we have an ethyl ester group, specifically -COOCH₂CH₃. The NMR quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the ethyl group is attached to the ester oxygen.\n    *   Putting these pieces together on a 1,4-disubstituted ring gives ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n5.  **Verify Against Options:**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Wrong substitution pattern (1,3 not 1,4) and it's an amide, not an ester (IR mismatch).\n    *   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Matches all data perfectly. Benzene ring (DBE=4) + ester C=O (DBE=1). Has a -NH₂ group (IR & NMR). Has an ethoxy group -OCH₂CH₃ (NMR t & q). Has a 1,4-disubstituted ring (NMR two doublets).\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Wrong functional group. It's a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two.\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group is on the wrong side of the ester. This would give an NMR signal for -C(=O)CH₂- at ~2.5 ppm, not an -OCH₂- at 4.5 ppm.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectroscopic data to identify the structure of C9H11NO2.\n    \"\"\"\n    molecular_formula = \"C9H11NO2\"\n    \n    # Data provided\n    ir_data = {\n        \"N-H stretch\": \"3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium-strong)\",\n        \"C=O stretch\": \"1720 cm-1 (strong)\"\n    }\n    \n    nmr_data = {\n        \"1.20 ppm\": \"t, 3H\",\n        \"4.0 ppm\": \"bs, 2H\",\n        \"4.5 ppm\": \"q, 2H\",\n        \"7.0 ppm\": \"d, 2H\",\n        \"8.0 ppm\": \"d, 2H\"\n    }\n\n    # Choices\n    choices = {\n        \"A\": \"3-ethoxybenzamide\",\n        \"B\": \"ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\",\n        \"C\": \"N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\",\n        \"D\": \"4-aminophenyl propionate\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the spectral data for C9H11NO2:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n    # DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2\n    dbe = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2\n    print(f\"\\n1.
