    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum redshift required to shift the Lyman-alpha line from its rest wavelength in the ultraviolet spectrum into the optical spectrum observable by ground-based telescopes.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the rest wavelength:** The Lyman-alpha transition has a rest wavelength (λ_rest) of approximately 1216 Å. This is in the far-ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n2.  **Identify the observational constraint:** Ground-based optical telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most ultraviolet light. The atmospheric cutoff occurs around 3500 Å. Therefore, to be detected, the light must have a wavelength greater than this value. We will use λ_obs_min = 3500 Å as the minimum observable wavelength.\n3.  **Use the redshift formula:** The redshift (z) relates the observed wavelength (λ_obs) to the rest wavelength (λ_rest) by the formula:\n    `λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z)`\n4.  **Calculate the minimum redshift:** To find the lower limit on the redshift, we will set λ_obs to our minimum observable wavelength (λ_obs_min) and solve for z.\n    `z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1`\n    `z_min = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1`\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# 1. Define the constants\n# Rest wavelength of Lyman-alpha transition in Angstroms\nlambda_rest = 1216.0\n\n# Minimum wavelength observable by ground-based optical telescopes due to\n# atmospheric cutoff, in Angstroms. A typical value is around 3500 A.\nlambda_obs_min = 3500.0\n\n# 2. Calculate the minimum redshift using the redshift formula\n# z = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1\nz_min = (lambda_obs_min / lambda_rest) - 1\n\n# 3. Print the results and the available choices\nprint(f\"The rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line is {lambda_rest} Angstroms.\")\nprint(f\"The minimum observable wavelength from the ground is approximately {lambda_obs_min} Angstroms.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated lower limit on the redshift (z) is: {z_min:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 1.9\")\nprint(\"B) 2.4\")\nprint(\"C) 1.2\")\nprint(\"D) 3\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value of ~1.88 is closest to option A.\")\n\n# Let's verify the wavelength for option A (z=1.9)\nz_A = 1.9\nobs_wavelength_A = lambda_rest * (1 + z_A)\nprint(f\"\\nFor a redshift z = 1.9, the Lyman-alpha line would be observed at {obs_wavelength_A:.1f} Angstroms, which is just inside the optical window.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
