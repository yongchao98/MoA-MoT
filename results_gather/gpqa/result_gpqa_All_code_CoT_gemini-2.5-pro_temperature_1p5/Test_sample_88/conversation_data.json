    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1.**\n    The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When heated with a strong base like KOH, adamantane derivatives are known to undergo complex rearrangements. The product formula can be inferred from the ¹H NMR spectrum as C₁₀H₁₄O (totaling 14 protons). The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone. A known and plausible reaction product under these conditions is **protoadamantan-4-one**. This is a rearranged, tetracyclic ketone that is an isomer of adamantanone. While the provided NMR data is unusual for this structure, the overall reaction sequence is most consistent with this starting point.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2.**\n    Product 1 (a ketone) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide and heated. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces the ketone to a secondary alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol). The heating, in the presence of the Lewis acidic aluminum reagent, promotes a subsequent dehydration reaction. Dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol yields the alkene **protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3.**\n    Product 2 (an alkene) is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃) followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS). This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. In protoadamant-4-ene, the double bond is between two methine (CH) groups. Cleavage of this bond opens up one of the rings in the cage structure, resulting in a single larger molecule containing two aldehyde (-CHO) groups. The final structure, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n    The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding exchangeable ones). The most deshielded protons are the aldehyde protons (-CHO), which typically have a chemical shift of 9-10 ppm. Aldehyde protons do not exchange with deuterated solvents under normal conditions.\n\n    We must analyze the couplings for one of these aldehyde protons. Let's consider the aldehyde group at position 3:\n    *   **³J Coupling:** The aldehyde proton is coupled to the single proton on the carbon to which the aldehyde group is attached (H3). This coupling to one proton will split the signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   **⁴J Coupling (Long-Range):** In rigid bicyclic systems, long-range coupling across 4 bonds is common, especially through a \"W-shaped\" pathway. The aldehyde proton has such a pathway to the *endo* protons on the two adjacent methylene (CH₂) groups (at C2 and C4). Due to the molecule's symmetry, these two *endo* protons are equivalent. Coupling to two equivalent protons will split the signal into a **triplet** (according to the n+1 rule, where n=2).\n\n    Combining these effects, the aldehyde proton signal is first split into a doublet (by H3) and each line of that doublet is further split into a triplet (by the two equivalent endo protons). The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\n```python\n# Based on the chemical transformations, the final product is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde.\n# The most deshielded protons are the two equivalent aldehyde protons (CHO).\n# The signal for each aldehyde proton is split by the adjacent methine proton (1H), resulting in a doublet.\n# This signal is further split by long-range 'W' coupling to two equivalent 'endo' protons on the neighboring CH2 groups, resulting in a triplet.\n# The combined splitting pattern is therefore a \"doublet of triplets\".\n\nprint(\"The most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is the aldehyde proton.\")\nprint(\"Its signal is split into a doublet by the adjacent methine proton.\")\nprint(\"Each line of the doublet is further split into a triplet by long-range coupling to two equivalent protons.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the final coupling pattern is a doublet of triplets.\")\nprint(\"The correct option is D.\")\nprint(\"A) pentet\")\nprint(\"B) triplet of triplets\")\nprint(\"C) triplet\")\nprint(\"D) doublet of triplets\")\n<<<D>>>\n```"
