    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the core concepts:** The problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) produced by a moving point charge. These are fundamental quantities in electromagnetism known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. They are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a point charge in motion.\n\n2.  **The Role of Retarded Time:** Because electromagnetic interactions propagate at the finite speed of light, $c$, the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ do not depend on the charge's position at time $t$, but on its position and velocity at an earlier, or \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. The time difference, $t-t_r$, is the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer's position at $t$.\n\n3.  **Define Variables based on the Problem:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge $q$ at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position of the observer (the field point).\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observer.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The magnitude of this vector, i.e., the distance.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}$.\n    *   The retarded time condition is given by: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n4.  **State the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas:** The general expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n    The term in the denominator, $d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c$, accounts for the fact that the volume element of the charge appears compressed or expanded from the observer's point of view due to the charge's motion (a relativistic effect related to the Doppler shift).\n\n5.  **Simplify and Compare with Options:** To match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the fractions by $c$:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** These derived expressions exactly match the formulas given in **Option B**.\n    *   Options A and D represent static or quasi-static approximations, which are incorrect for a general moving charge.\n    *   Option C has an incorrect sign in the denominator, which would lead to unphysical results (e.g., a weaker field for a charge approaching the observer).\n\nThe correct choice is therefore B. The following Python code will print this choice.\n\n```python\n# The Liénard-Wiechert potentials describe the classical electromagnetic effect\n# of a moving electric point charge in terms of a scalar and a vector potential.\n\n# The scalar potential V is given by:\n# V(r,t) = (1 / (4 * pi * epsilon_0)) * [q / (d - d_vec . v_vec / c)]\n# where all terms in the bracket are evaluated at the retarded time tr.\n# d is the magnitude of the vector d_vec.\n\n# The vector potential A is given by:\n# A(r,t) = (mu_0 / (4 * pi)) * [q * v_vec / (d - d_vec . v_vec / c)]\n\n# To match the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n# V(r,t) = (1 / (4 * pi * epsilon_0)) * [q*c / (d*c - d_vec . v_vec)]\n# A(r,t) = (mu_0 / (4 * pi)) * [q*c*v_vec / (d*c - d_vec . v_vec)]\n\n# We can also note the relationship between A and V:\n# A = (v_vec / c^2) * V, since mu_0 * epsilon_0 = 1/c^2.\n\n# Comparing these standard forms with the given options, we find that\n# Option B is the correct one.\n# B) V(r,t) = qc / (4*pi*epsilon_0 * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec)), A(r,t) = (mu_0 * q*c * v_vec) / (4*pi * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec))\n\n# The Python code will now print the correct choice.\ncorrect_choice = 'B'\nprint(\"The correct choice is:\")\nprint(correct_choice)\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
