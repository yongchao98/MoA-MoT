    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Concept:** The problem describes a scenario where two reference frames are moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light. The time measured is different in each frame. This is a classic application of Einstein's theory of special relativity, specifically the concept of **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define the Reference Frames:**\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time given, 50 seconds, is measured in this frame. Since it's the frame of the moving object, this time is the **proper time (Δt')**.\n\n3.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Proper time (time in the ejecta's frame), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   Speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    a.  **Calculate Time Dilation:** The time that passes in the Galaxy's frame (S) will be longer than the proper time measured in the ejecta's frame (S'). We need to calculate this dilated time (`Δt`) using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n        where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) `\n    b.  **Calculate Distance:** Once we have the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`), we can calculate the distance the ejecta travels in that frame using the standard distance formula:\n        `distance = velocity * time`\n        `d = v * Δt`\n\n5.  **Execute the Plan with Python:**\n    a.  Define the constants `v`, `c`, and `dt_prime`.\n    b.  Calculate `γ` (gamma).\n    c.  Use `γ` to find the dilated time `dt`.\n    d.  Multiply `dt` by the velocity `v` to get the final distance `d`.\n    e.  Compare the calculated distance with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This problem can be solved using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n# The time measured in the moving reference frame (the ejecta) is called the proper time.\n# An observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer, \"dilated\" time.\n\n# Step 1: Define the given physical quantities.\n# Velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy in km/s.\nv = 60000.0\n# Proper time, which is the time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame in seconds.\ndt_prime = 50.0\n# Speed of light in km/s.\nc = 300000.0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the dilated time (dt) in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n# The formula for time dilation is dt = gamma * dt_prime,\n# where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).\nbeta_squared = (v / c)**2\ngamma = 1.0 / math.sqrt(1.0 - beta_squared)\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n# The distance is the velocity multiplied by the dilated time.\ndistance = v * dt\n\n# Step 4: Print the results and compare with the options.\nprint(\"Given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 2 940 000 km\")\nprint(\"B) 2 880 000 km\")\nprint(\"C) 3 060 000 km\")\nprint(\"D) 3 000 000 km\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"Calculated time in Galaxy frame (Δt): {dt:.4f} s\")\nprint(f\"Calculated distance in Galaxy frame (d = v * Δt): {distance:.0f} km\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(\"The calculated distance is closest to option C.\")\nprint(\"The final answer is C\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
