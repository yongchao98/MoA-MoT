    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The core principle here is the normalization of the wave function. The probability of finding a particle somewhere in the space it can exist must be 1 (or 100%).\n2.  **Calculate Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a position `x` is not given by the wave function `ψ(x)` itself, but by its probability density, which is the square of the magnitude of the wave function, `|ψ(x)|²`.\n3.  **Handle Complex Numbers:** The wave function `ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i` is a complex number. For a complex number `z = R + Ii`, its magnitude squared is `|z|² = R² + I²`.\n    *   Real part `R = a / sqrt(1 + x)`\n    *   Imaginary part `I = -0.5`\n    *   So, `|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25`.\n4.  **Set up the Normalization Integral:** The problem states the particle is only found between `x=1` and `x=3`. Therefore, the integral of the probability density over this interval must equal 1.\n    ∫ [from 1 to 3] `(a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1`\n5.  **Solve the Integral:** I will solve this definite integral to find an equation for `a`.\n    *   The integral of `a² / (1 + x)` is `a² * ln(1 + x)`.\n    *   The integral of `0.25` is `0.25 * x`.\n    *   Evaluating the definite integral gives: `[a² * ln(1+x) + 0.25x]` from 1 to 3.\n    *   This becomes `(a² * ln(4) + 0.25*3) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25*1) = 1`.\n    *   Simplifying this equation will allow me to solve for `a`.\n6.  **Code the Solution:** I will use Python to perform the final calculation for `a` and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The normalization condition is that the integral of the probability density from x=1 to x=3 is equal to 1.\n# Probability density |ψ(x)|² = a²/(1+x) + 0.25\n# ∫[from 1 to 3] (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n# This integral evaluates to: [a²*ln(1+x) + 0.25*x] from 1 to 3 = 1\n# (a²*ln(4) + 0.25*3) - (a²*ln(2) + 0.25*1) = 1\n# a²*(ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.75 - 0.25 = 1\n# a²*ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\n# a²*ln(2) = 0.5\n# a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n# a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n# Calculate the value of ln(2)\nln_2 = math.log(2)\n\n# Calculate a squared\na_squared = 0.5 / ln_2\n\n# Calculate a\na = math.sqrt(a_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated value of 'a' is: {a:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 1.1\")\nprint(\"B) 0.85\")\nprint(\"C) 0.35\")\nprint(\"D) 0.6\")\nprint(\"\\nThe value a ≈ 0.8493 is closest to 0.85.\")\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
