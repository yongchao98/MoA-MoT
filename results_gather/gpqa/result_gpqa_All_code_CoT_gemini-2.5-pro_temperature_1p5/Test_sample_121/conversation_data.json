    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2) and a catalyst system (pyridine/acetic anhydride). This is an alpha-halogenation reaction, where one of the alpha-hydrogens on the methyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   *Product 1 is Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).*\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid group is converted into an ethyl ester.\n    *   *Product 2 is Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).*\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and will replace the bromine atom via an SN2 reaction.\n    *   *Product 3 is Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).*\n\n4.  **Product 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   First, the strong base (NaH) deprotonates the acidic alpha-carbon (the CH2 between the CN and COOEt groups) to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   This enolate attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n    *   This creates an intermediate that still has an acidic alpha-hydrogen. The excess NaH deprotonates it again, forming a new anion.\n    *   This new anion undergoes a rapid, intramolecular SN2 reaction (a Thorpe-Ziegler condensation), where it attacks the bromine atom at the other end of the pentyl chain. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   *The final product, 4, is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.*\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane):**\n\nTo count the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   The molecule has a chiral center at C1 (the carbon bonded to both the -CN and -COOEt groups). This lack of symmetry means that corresponding positions on opposite sides of the ring (e.g., C2 and C6) are not equivalent.\n*   We will assume rapid chair-flipping, which is typical for unsubstituted or lightly substituted cyclohexanes at room temperature. This simplifies the spectrum by averaging the axial and equatorial environments for each carbon.\n\nLet's count the signals:\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-CH2-) are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to the C1 chiral center. They are chemically non-equivalent. **(2 signals)**\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   Because C1 is a stereocenter, all five methylene groups on the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are in chemically distinct environments.\n    *   With rapid chair-flipping, the two protons on each of these carbons become chemically equivalent (their environments are averaged).\n    *   Therefore, we get one signal for the C2-protons, one for C3, one for C4, one for C5, and one for C6. **(5 signals)**\n\n**Total number of signals:** 1 (ethyl CH3) + 2 (ethyl CH2) + 5 (ring CH2 groups) = 8 signals.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the initial reactants\nacetic_acid = \"CH3COOH\"\nreagents_1 = [\"Br2\", \"pyridine\", \"acetic anhydride\", \"heat\"]\n\n# Product 1: Alpha-bromination\nproduct_1 = \"Br-CH2-COOH\" # Bromoacetic acid\n\n# Step 2: Fischer Esterification\nethanol = \"CH3CH2OH\"\nacid_catalyst = \"H2SO4\"\nproduct_2 = \"Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3\" # Ethyl bromoacetate\n\n# Step 3: Nucleophilic Substitution with Cyanide\nsodium_cyanide = \"NaCN\"\nproduct_3 = \"NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3\" # Ethyl cyanoacetate\n\n# Step 4: Cyclization\n# Reaction with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane leads to intramolecular cyclization.\nfinal_product_4_name = \"1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane\"\n\n# 1H NMR Analysis of the Final Product 4\n# The molecule has a chiral center at C1. There is no plane of symmetry.\n# We assume rapid chair inversion at room temperature, which averages axial and equatorial protons on each ring carbon.\n\n# Signal counting:\n# 1. Ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3)\n# The three methyl (CH3) protons are equivalent.\nethyl_ch3_signals = 1\n# The two methylene (CH2) protons are diastereotopic due to the adjacent C1 chiral center.\nethyl_ch2_signals = 2\n\n# 2. Cyclohexane ring\n# The C1 carbon is a chiral center.\n# This makes all 5 CH2 groups of the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) chemically distinct.\n# With rapid chair flipping, the 2 protons on each distinct carbon are averaged into a single signal.\n# So, we have one signal for each unique CH2 group.\nring_signals = 5 # (one each for C2, C3, C4, C5, C6)\n\n# 3.
