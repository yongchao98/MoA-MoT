    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the forbidden transition:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State (NN):** `1S0`. This term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us:\n        *   Spin `S_i = 0`\n        *   Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`\n        *   Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`\n        *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   **Final State (NN + X):** This consists of a new two-nucleon state `NN_f` and an emitted particle `X`.\n        *   `NN_f` is described by the term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n        *   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1` (given).\n        *   The orbital angular momentum of `X` relative to the `NN_f` system is `l_f` (given by the lowercase letter: s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws and Principles:** A transition is only permitted if it obeys all relevant physical laws. We must check the following for each option:\n    *   **Possibility of the NN State:** A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles (proton, neutron). Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state requiring another value of `S` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem gives the rule for the final two-nucleon state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are told to assume the final state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`. The rule thus becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which means `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number. Any final `NN_f` state where `S_f + L_f` is even is forbidden.\n    *   **Parity Conservation:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n        *   `P_initial = P_final`\n        *   `P_i = +1`\n        *   `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X_orbital) * P(X_intrinsic) = (-1)^L_f * (-1)^l_f * (-1)`\n        *   So, we must have `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_f + 1)`. This means the exponent `L_f + l_f + 1` must be even, which implies `L_f + l_f` must be **odd**.\n    *   **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum must be conserved (`J_i = J_f`). Since `J_i = 0`, the total angular momentum of the final state must be 0. The final angular momentum is a vector sum of the `NN_f` total angular momentum `J_f` and the angular momentum of particle X (its orbital `l_f` and spin `s_X`). It is always possible to find a suitable spin `s_X` to make this conservation work as long as the other rules are satisfied, so this rule is less restrictive than the others for this problem.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Option:** We will apply these checks sequentially. A failure at any step means the transition is not permitted. The most fundamental check is whether the state can exist at all.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_transition(option, name, s_nn, l_nn_char, l_x_char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a nuclear transition based on physical principles.\n    Prints the step-by-step analysis.\n    Returns \"Permitted\" or \"Forbidden\".\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"--- Analyzing Option {option}: {name} ---\")\n\n    # Map character notation to integer quantum numbers\n    L_MAP = {'S': 0, 'P': 1, 'D': 2, 'F': 3}\n    l_map = {'s': 0, 'p': 1, 'd': 2, 'f': 3}\n    l_nn = L_MAP[l_nn_char]\n    l_x = l_map[l_x_char]\n\n    # 1.
