    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the relationship between the number of stars and parallax.\n\n1.  **Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, `n` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:** The number of stars `N` within a given volume `V` is `N = n * V`.\n\n3.  **Stars up to a distance `d`:** Consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer. The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3) * pi * d^3`. The number of stars within this distance is `N(d) = n * (4/3) * pi * d^3`.\n\n4.  **Stars in a thin shell:** Now, let's find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`. The volume of this shell, `dV`, is the surface area of the sphere (`4 * pi * d^2`) times the thickness of the shell (`dd`). So, `dV = 4 * pi * d^2 * dd`.\n    The number of stars in this shell is `dN = n * dV = n * 4 * pi * d^2 * dd`.\n\n5.  **Introduce Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`d`), i.e., `plx = 1/d`. This also means `d = 1/plx`.\n\n6.  **Relate `dd` to `d(plx)`:** We need to express the thickness of the shell `dd` in terms of a change in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd / d(plx) = -1 / plx^2`.\n    Therefore, `dd = -(1 / plx^2) * d(plx)`. The negative sign simply means that as distance increases, parallax decreases. When we are counting stars in a range (a magnitude), we can ignore the sign. So, `dd = (1 / plx^2) * d(plx)`.\n\n7.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx`:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = n * 4 * pi * (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = n * 4 * pi * (1/plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n8.  **Find the number of stars per unit parallax:** The question asks for how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with `plx`. This is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`.\n    `dN / d(plx) = n * 4 * pi * (1 / plx^4)`\n\nSince `n`, `4`, and `pi` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_star_distribution():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step derivation for how the number of stars\n    per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming a uniform\n    distribution of stars.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define symbols for clarity\n    n = sympy.Symbol('n')       # Constant number density of stars\n    d = sympy.Symbol('d')       # Distance\n    plx = sympy.Symbol('plx')   # Parallax\n\n    # Step 1: Number of stars (N) in a spherical shell of radius d and thickness dd\n    # N is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is surface_area * thickness\n    # dN ~ d^2 * dd\n    print(\"Step 1: The number of stars (dN) in a thin spherical shell is proportional to the volume of the shell.\")\n    print(f\"The volume of a shell at distance 'd' with thickness 'dd' is proportional to d^2 * dd.\")\n    print(\"So, dN ∝ d^2 * dd\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Relate distance (d) to parallax (plx)\n    # d = 1 / plx\n    print(\"Step 2: Distance 'd' is inversely proportional to parallax 'plx'.\")\n    print(\"d = 1 / plx\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Relate the differential dd to d(plx)\n    # Differentiate d with respect to plx to find the relationship between their differentials.\n    # d(d)/d(plx) = -1 / plx^2 => |dd| = (1 / plx^2) * |d(plx)|\n    d_expr = 1 / plx\n    dd_dplx = sympy.diff(d_expr, plx)\n    print(\"Step 3: Find the relationship between the differentials dd and d(plx).\")\n    print(f\"Taking the derivative of d = 1/plx with respect to plx gives: {dd_dplx}\")\n    print(\"Ignoring the negative sign (as we're interested in magnitudes), we get: dd ∝ (1/plx^2) * d(plx)\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Substitute expressions for d and dd back into the proportionality for dN\n    # dN ∝ d^2 * dd\n    # dN ∝ (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) * d(plx)\n    # dN ∝ (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) * d(plx)\n    # dN ∝ (1/plx^4) * d(plx)\n    print(\"Step 4: Substitute the expressions for 'd' and 'dd' back into the relation for dN.\")\n    print(\"dN ∝ d^2 * dd\")\n    print(\"dN ∝ (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) * d(plx)\")\n    print(\"dN ∝ 1/plx^4 * d(plx)\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Determine the number of stars per unit parallax, dN/d(plx)\n    # dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4\n    print(\"Step 5: The number of stars per unit parallax range is dN/d(plx).\")\n    print(\"From the previous step, we can see:\")\n    print(\"dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 6: Compare with the given choices\n    print(\"The available choices are:\")\n    print(\"A) ~ 1/plx^3\")\n    print(\"B) ~ 1/plx^1\")\n    print(\"C) ~ 1/plx^2\")\n    print(\"D) ~ 1/plx^4\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on the derivation, the correct choice is D.\")\n\nsolve_star_distribution()\n<<<D>>>\n```"
