    "Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing formula:** The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction ($\\theta=0$) is given by the partial wave series formula:\n    $$ \\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l) $$\n    where $k$ is the wave number and $\\delta_l$ are the phase shifts for each partial wave $l$. We will sum over the given phase shifts from $l=0$ to $l=4$ and assume the rest are zero.\n\n2.  **Calculate the wave number ($k$):** The wave number is related to the kinetic energy ($T$) of the electron. Although the electron's energy (50 MeV) is relativistic, standard textbook problems in this context often use the non-relativistic formula for simplicity, which we will assume to match one of the given options. The non-relativistic formula is:\n    $$ k = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m_e T}}{\\hbar} $$\n    We can calculate this using the well-known physics constants in convenient units: kinetic energy $T = 50$ MeV, electron rest mass energy $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511$ MeV, and $\\hbar c \\approx 197.3$ MeV fm. The formula can be rewritten as:\n    $$ k = \\frac{\\sqrt{2(m_e c^2)T}}{\\hbar c} $$\n\n3.  **Compute the sum:** We will calculate the summation term $\\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l)$ using the provided phase shifts. Remember to convert the phase shifts from degrees to radians for use in the `sin` function.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final result:** Finally, we will divide the sum calculated in step 3 by the wave number $k$ from step 2 to find $\\text{Im}[f(0)]$. The final code will print this result alongside the given options for comparison.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and given phase shifts.\n# Phase shifts in degrees\nphase_shifts_deg = {\n    0: 90.0,\n    1: 67.0,\n    2: 55.0,\n    3: 30.0,\n    4: 13.0\n}\n# Kinetic energy in MeV\nT = 50.0\n# Electron rest mass energy in MeV\nm_e_c2 = 0.511\n# h-bar * c in MeV fm\nhbar_c = 197.3\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the wave number k using the non-relativistic formula.\n# k = sqrt(2 * m_e * T) / hbar = sqrt(2 * (m_e*c^2) * T) / (hbar*c)\nk = math.sqrt(2 * m_e_c2 * T) / hbar_c\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the summation term.\n# The sum is over l from 0 to 4.\nsum_term = 0.0\nfor l, delta_deg in phase_shifts_deg.items():\n    # Convert phase shift from degrees to radians\n    delta_rad = math.radians(delta_deg)\n    # Add the contribution of this partial wave to the sum\n    sum_term += (2 * l + 1) * (math.sin(delta_rad))**2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude.\n# Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * sum_term\nim_f0 = sum_term / k\n\n# Step 5: Print the calculated result and the choices for comparison.\nprint(f\"Calculated imaginary part of the scattering amplitude: {im_f0:.3f} fm\\n\")\nprint(\"Choices:\")\nprint(f\"A) 87163.4 fm\")\nprint(f\"B) 355.351 fm\")\nprint(f\"C) 251.271 fm\")\nprint(f\"D) 177.675 fm\")\n\n<<<C>>>"
