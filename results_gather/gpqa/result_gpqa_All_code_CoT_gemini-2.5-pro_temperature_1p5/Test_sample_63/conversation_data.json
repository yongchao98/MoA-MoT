    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** I will first determine the composition and molar quantities of the gaseous products based on the experimental data provided.\n    *   The mass increase in tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂) corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced. I'll calculate the moles of H₂O.\n    *   The weight of tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂) did not change, which means no acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ were formed.\n    *   The mass increase in tube №3 (hot copper) corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms from an oxidizing gas (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ -> 2CuO. I'll calculate the moles of O₂.\n    *   The remaining gas C (2.24 L at STP) passed through all tubes, indicating it's unreactive. Given the likely elements, this gas must be nitrogen (N₂). I'll calculate its moles.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Reactants (Salts A and B):**\n    *   The products (H₂O, N₂, O₂) are composed of hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. This strongly suggests that salts A and B are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions.\n    *   I'll consider the decomposition reactions of common salts that fit this profile. Specifically, ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂), which decompose as follows:\n        *   `2 NH₄NO₃(s) → 2 N₂(g) + 4 H₂O(g) + O₂(g)`\n        *   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2 H₂O(g)`\n    *   This pair of reactions produces all the observed gases and no others.\n\n3.  **Solve for Quantities:**\n    *   The mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n    *   Oxygen (O₂) is only produced by the decomposition of ammonium nitrate. Using the moles of O₂ calculated in step 1, I can determine the moles of ammonium nitrate (`n`) in the initial mixture.\n    *   Since the mixture is equimolar, the moles of ammonium nitrite will also be `n`.\n\n4.  **Verify the Hypothesis:**\n    *   Using the calculated value of `n`, I will verify that the decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ produces the exact amounts of N₂ and H₂O calculated in step 1.\n    *   I will also calculate the total initial mass of the mixture (`n` * M(NH₄NO₃) + `n` * M(NH₄NO₂)) and check if it equals the given 7.20 g.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Once salts A and B are confirmed to be NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂, I will count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n    *   The final answer will be the sum of the atoms in NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses of relevant atoms and molecules (in g/mol)\nM_H = 1.0\nM_N = 14.0\nM_O = 16.0\nM_H2O = 2 * M_H + M_O\nM_N2 = 2 * M_N\nM_O2 = 2 * M_O\n\n# --- Step 1: Analyze the gaseous products ---\nprint(\"Step 1: Determining the moles of each gaseous product.\")\n\n# Water (H2O) absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2\nmass_H2O = 3.60  # g\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\nprint(f\"The mass of water produced is {mass_H2O} g, which is {moles_H2O:.3f} moles of H2O.\")\n\n# Oxygen (O2) reacted with hot copper.
