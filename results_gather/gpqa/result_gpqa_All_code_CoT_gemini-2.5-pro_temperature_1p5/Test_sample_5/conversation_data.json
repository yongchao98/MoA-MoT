    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation followed by the Python code to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\nMy plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Transform Coordinates:** The potential `V(r, θ)` is given in polar coordinates. I will first convert it to Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)` using the standard transformations `x = r cos(θ)` and `r² = x² + y²`.\n2.  **Separate the Potential:** Once transformed, the potential `V(x, y)` will separate into a sum of two independent potentials, `V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`, where one part depends only on `x` and the other only on `y`.\n3.  **Identify Harmonic Oscillators:** I will recognize that `V_x(x)` and `V_y(y)` are the potentials of two independent 1D simple harmonic oscillators (SHOs). The standard SHO potential is `V(q) = 1/2 k_eff * q²`.\n4.  **Find Frequencies:** For each oscillator, I will find its effective spring constant `k_eff` and then its angular frequency `ω` using the relation `ω = sqrt(k_eff / m)`.\n5.  **Calculate Energy Spectrum:** The total energy of the 2D system is the sum of the energies of the two independent SHOs. The energy eigenvalue for a 1D SHO is given by the formula `E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω`. I will sum the energies for the x and y directions (`E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}`) to find the total energy spectrum.\n6.  **Select the Correct Option:** Finally, I will simplify the resulting expression for the total energy `E` and use a Python script to compare it with the given options and select the correct one.\n\n#### Execution of the Plan:\n\n1.  **Transform Coordinates:**\n    The potential is `V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)`.\n    We can rewrite this as `V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 k (r cos(θ))²`.\n    Substituting `x = r cos(θ)` and `r² = x² + y²`:\n    `V(x, y) = 1/2 k (x² + y²) + 3/2 k x²`\n\n2.  **Separate the Potential:**\n    Combine the terms:\n    `V(x, y) = (1/2 kx² + 3/2 kx²) + 1/2 ky²`\n    `V(x, y) = (4/2 kx²) + 1/2 ky²`\n    `V(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²`\n    This potential is now separated: `V_x(x) = 2kx²` and `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky²`.\n\n3.  **Identify Harmonic Oscillators:**\n    We match these to the standard form `V(q) = 1/2 k_eff * q²`.\n    For the x-direction: `1/2 k_x * x² = 2kx²`  =>  `k_x = 4k`.\n    For the y-direction: `1/2 k_y * y² = 1/2 ky²` => `k_y = k`.\n\n4.  **Find Frequencies:**\n    The angular frequency for each oscillator is `ω = sqrt(k_eff / m)`.\n    `ω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)`.\n    `ω_y = sqrt(k_y / m) = sqrt(k / m)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy is `E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}`.\n    `E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`.\n    `E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`.\n\n    Summing the energies:\n    `E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} = (2n_x + 1)ħ*sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m)`\n    `E = [(2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ*sqrt(k/m)`\n    `E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ*sqrt(k/m)`\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Option:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is `E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m)`. This matches option B. The following python code will programmatically verify this choice.\n\n```python\ndef find_correct_energy_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function programmatically selects the correct energy spectrum\n    based on the coefficients derived from the physical system.\n\n    The derived energy expression is of the form:\n    E = (coeff_nx * n_x + coeff_ny * n_y + constant) * hbar * sqrt(k/m)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Coefficients from our physics derivation: E = (2*n_x + 1*n_y + 1.5) * ...\n    derived_coeffs = {'nx': 2, 'ny': 1, 'const': 1.5}\n\n    # The choices provided in the problem, represented by their coefficients.\n    options = {\n        'A': {'nx': 3, 'ny': 2, 'const': 0.5, 'str': \"E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\"},\n        'B': {'nx': 2, 'ny': 1, 'const': 1.5, 'str': \"E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\"},\n        'C': {'nx': 1, 'ny': 3, 'const': 1.5, 'str': \"E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\"},\n        'D': {'nx': 2, 'ny': 3, 'const': 0.5, 'str': \"E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\"}\n    }\n\n    # Find the option that matches the derived coefficients\n    correct_choice = None\n    for choice, values in options.items():\n        if (values['nx'] == derived_coeffs['nx'] and\n            values['ny'] == derived_coeffs['ny'] and\n            values['const'] == derived_coeffs['const']):\n            correct_choice = choice\n            break\n\n    if correct_choice:\n        print(f\"The derivation shows the energy spectrum is E = ({derived_coeffs['nx']}n_x + {derived_coeffs['ny']}n_y + {derived_coeffs['const']}) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m).\")\n        print(f\"\\nThis matches option {correct_choice}.\")\n        print(\"The correct answer is:\")\n        print(f\"{correct_choice}) {options[correct_choice]['str']}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No matching option found based on the derivation.\")\n\nfind_correct_energy_spectrum()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
