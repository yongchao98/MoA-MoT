    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core of the problem is to calculate the time experienced by an astronaut traveling at a relativistic speed. This phenomenon is known as time dilation in Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Identify Given and Required Information:**\n    *   **Given:** The spacecraft's velocity ($v$) is 0.99999987 times the speed of light (c). The astronaut is 22 years old, and their species' average lifetime is 150 years.\n    *   **Missing:** The distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to Earth is not specified. I will use the commonly accepted approximate distance of 160,000 light-years, as this value aligns well with one of the provided answers.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Calculation Plan:**\n    a.  **Calculate Time from Earth's Perspective ($t$):** I will first determine the journey's duration as measured by an observer on Earth. This is calculated using the formula: `Time = Distance / Speed`.\n    b.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The time dilation effect is quantified by the Lorentz factor, which is calculated with the formula: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))`.\n    c.  **Calculate Time from Astronaut's Perspective ($t'$):** The time the astronaut experiences (known as proper time) is found by dividing the Earth-frame time by the Lorentz factor: `t' = t / γ`. This value represents the length of the journey for the astronaut.\n    d.  **Check for Survival:** I'll calculate the astronaut's age upon arrival by adding the journey time ($t'$) to their initial age. This will confirm whether they survive the trip, thereby evaluating the viability of option B.\n    e.  **Select the Final Answer:** I will compare the calculated astronaut-frame time ($t'$) with the given options (A, C, D) to find the closest match.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will now write a Python script to execute these calculations. The script will print the steps and the result to clearly demonstrate how the answer is derived.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_relativity_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the time experienced by an astronaut traveling at relativistic speeds\n    and determines the correct option among the choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define constants and assumptions ---\n    # Velocity as a fraction of the speed of light (c)\n    v_over_c = 0.99999987\n    # The distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is assumed to be 160,000 light-years.\n    # This is a standard astronomical estimate that fits the problem's options.\n    distance_light_years = 160000\n    # Astronaut's initial age and species' average lifespan\n    astronaut_initial_age = 22\n    alien_lifespan = 150\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate the journey time in Earth's reference frame ---\n    # t = Distance / Speed.
