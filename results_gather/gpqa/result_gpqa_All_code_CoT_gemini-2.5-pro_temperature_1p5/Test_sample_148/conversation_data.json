    "Here is my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I'll break down the provided analytical data into key points.\n    *   **Compound:** A small synthetic peptide. Peptides are made of amino acids linked by amide bonds. Amino acids (except glycine) are chiral.\n    *   **Â¹H NMR Data:**\n        *   Two peaks for a single alpha-proton. This means the proton exists in two distinct chemical environments.\n        *   Similar chemical shifts: The two environments are structurally very similar.\n        *   Roughly equal integrals (summing to 1H): The two species are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n        *   Not spin-spin coupling: The splitting is not due to adjacent protons.\n    *   **LC-MS Data:**\n        *   Elevated temperature: This is a hint that the two species might be interconverting at room temperature (like rotamers), but the higher temperature either allows separation or \"freezes\" the conformations for the duration of the chromatography run.\n        *   Two clearly defined peaks: There are two distinct chemical compounds that can be separated by liquid chromatography (LC).\n        *   Equal intensities: Confirms the ~1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n        *   Same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule: This is a crucial piece of information. Both compounds have the same molecular formula and mass. This rules out impurities like precursors or side-products that would have a different mass.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Evidence:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. For example, if you are synthesizing a dipeptide from an L-amino acid and another L-amino acid, racemization during synthesis could lead to a mixture of the L-L dipeptide and the L-D dipeptide. These two are diastereomers.\n        *   **Fit with NMR:** Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties, so they would produce distinct NMR spectra. A 1:1 mixture would show two sets of peaks with equal integrals. This fits perfectly.\n        *   **Fit with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. They have the same molecular formula, so they would have identical mass spectra. This also fits perfectly. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   **Definition:** A precursor is a starting material from an earlier step.\n        *   **Fit with Evidence:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. The data explicitly states both peaks have the *same mass spectrum* as the final product. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   **Definition:** This is a synthesis side-reaction creating a new molecule. For example, an amine reacting with two activated carboxylic acids.\n        *   **Fit with Evidence:** This side-product would have a different molecular formula and a significantly different mass. Again, this is contradicted by the MS data showing both peaks have the expected mass. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n        *   **Fit with NMR:** Enantiomers have identical NMR spectra in a standard (achiral) solvent. You would see only a single set of peaks, not two.\n        *   **Fit with LC-MS:** Enantiomers behave identically in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated by standard LC; a special chiral column is required. The problem implies a standard LC-MS setup that achieves separation. This option is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The only explanation that is consistent with all the provided data (distinct NMR signals, separability by LC, and identical mass) is that the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers. The synthesis process likely caused racemization at one of the chiral centers, leading to a ~1:1 mixture.\n\n4.  **Plan for the Python Code:** The code will not perform calculations but will instead lay out the logical deduction step-by-step.\n    *   It will state the key evidence points from the prompt.\n    *   It will evaluate each option (A, B, C, D) against the evidence.\n    *   It will print why options B, C, and D are incorrect based on the evidence.\n    *   It will print why option A is the correct explanation.\n    *   Finally, it will print the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_synthesis_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided analytical chemistry data to determine the most likely\n    explanation for the observed phenomena.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Summary of key evidence\n    print(\"Analyzing the evidence:\")\n    print(\"1.
