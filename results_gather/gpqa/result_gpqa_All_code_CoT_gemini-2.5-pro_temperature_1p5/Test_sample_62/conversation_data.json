    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics:** The problem involves a diatomic molecule in its fundamental quantum state (`vibrational quantum number v=0`, `rotational quantum number J=0`). It absorbs a photon and transitions to a higher energy state. The energy of the absorbed photon, `ΔE`, determines its momentum, `p`, via the relation `p = ΔE / c`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n2.  **Identify Possible Transitions:** From the fundamental state (`v=0, J=0`), a single-photon absorption allows transitions where `ΔJ = +1`. The two lowest-energy possibilities are:\n    *   **Pure Rotational Transition:** `(v=0, J=0) → (v=0, J=1)`. The energy required is `ΔE_rot = 2B`, where `B` is the rotational constant.\n    *   **Rovibrational Transition:** `(v=0, J=0) → (v=1, J=1)`. The energy required is `ΔE_rovib = ħw + 2B`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `w` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n3.  **Interpret the Question:** The phrase \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" literally refers to the pure rotational transition, as `ΔE_rot` is much smaller than `ΔE_rovib`. However, we will calculate the momentum for both cases and compare them with the given options. This will help determine the intended transition.\n4.  **Perform Calculations:**\n    *   Convert all given units (amu to kg, angstroms to meters) to the SI system.\n    *   Calculate the reduced mass (`μ`) of the molecule.\n    *   Calculate the moment of inertia (`I = μR²`).\n    *   Calculate the rotational constant (`B = ħ² / (2I)`).\n    *   Calculate the energy change `ΔE` for the rovibrational transition (`ΔE = ħw + 2B`).\n    *   Calculate the corresponding photon momentum (`p = ΔE / c`).\n5.  **Select the Answer:** Compare the calculated momentum with the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the correct choice. The magnitude of the options strongly suggests that a vibrational transition is involved.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define given values and physical constants in SI units.\n# Given values for the diatomic molecule X-Y\nMx_amu = 20.0  # Mass of atom X in amu\nMy_amu = 2.0   # Mass of atom Y in amu\nR_angstrom = 2.0  # Molecular bond length in angstroms\nw = 4.0e14     # Angular frequency of vibration in rad/s\n\n# Physical constants\namu_to_kg = 1.660539e-27  # Conversion factor from amu to kg\nangstrom_to_m = 1.0e-10    # Conversion factor from angstroms to meters\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34    # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\nc = 2.99792458e8         # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 2: Calculate properties of the molecule.\n# Convert mass and bond length to SI units\nMx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\nR_m = R_angstrom * angstrom_to_m\n\n# Calculate the reduced mass (mu)\nmu = (Mx_kg * My_kg) / (Mx_kg + My_kg)\n\n# Calculate the moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu * R_m**2\n\n# Calculate the rotational constant (B)\nB = h_bar**2 / (2 * I)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the energy of the transition.\n# The question is ambiguous. The \"next state with the lowest possible energy\"\n# reachable via photon absorption is the purely rotational (v=0, J=1) state.\n# However, the momentum options are too large for a purely rotational transition.\n# This indicates the question is likely asking for the lowest-energy *rovibrational*\n# transition, which is (v=0, J=0) -> (v=1, J=1).\n# The energy for this transition is the sum of the vibrational and rotational energy changes.\nDelta_E_vibrational = h_bar * w\nDelta_E_rotational = 2 * B\nDelta_E_total = Delta_E_vibrational + Delta_E_rotational\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the momentum of the absorbed photon.\n# The momentum of a photon is its energy divided by the speed of light.\np = Delta_E_total / c\n\n# Step 5: Print the result and compare with the given options.\nprint(f\"Calculated momentum p = {p:.3e} N*s\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s\")\nprint(\"B) p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s\")\nprint(\"C) p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s\")\nprint(\"D) p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated momentum most closely matches option C.\")\n\n<<<C>>>\n```"
