    "This is a classic problem in quantum mechanics known as Larmor precession. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the oscillation frequency.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\nThe particle is spin-1/2 and is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the \"spin up\" state corresponding to the Z-axis. In quantum mechanics notation, the initial state vector `|ψ(0)>` is the eigenstate of the spin-Z operator `S_z` with a positive eigenvalue, which we denote as `|+z>`.\n\n**2. New Hamiltonian:**\nAt time `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction. The interaction energy of a magnetic moment `μ` with a magnetic field `B` is given by the Hamiltonian `H = -μ · B`. Since the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin (`μ = γS`), the new Hamiltonian governing the system's time evolution is `H = -γ * B * S_y`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio, `B` is the magnetic field magnitude, and `S_y` is the spin operator for the Y-direction.\n\n**3. Time Evolution of Expectation Value:**\nWe are interested in the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is given by `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t)`. To find this, we need to calculate how the expectation value of the spin operator `S_z` evolves in time, i.e., `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n\nUsing the laws of quantum mechanics (either the Schrödinger picture by evolving the state vector or the Heisenberg picture by evolving the operator), one can derive the time dependence of `<S_z>(t)`. The result of this calculation is:\n`<S_z>(t) = <S_z>(0) * cos(γBt)`\n\n**4. Identifying the Frequency:**\nFrom the result above, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(0) * cos(γBt)`\n\nThis equation describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is `cos(ωt)`, where `ω` (omega) is the angular frequency. By comparing this general form to our result, we can see that the oscillation frequency `ω` is equal to `γB`.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this conclusion to select the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_spin_precession():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the oscillation frequency of a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment.\n    \n    The problem describes Larmor precession. The evolution of the expectation value\n    of the spin component <S_z> under the influence of a Hamiltonian H = -gamma * B * S_y,\n    starting from an initial state aligned with the Z-axis, is given by:\n    \n    <S_z>(t) = <S_z>(0) * cos(omega * t)\n    \n    The angular frequency omega of this precession (the Larmor frequency) is\n    calculated to be gamma * B.\n    \n    The expectation value of the magnetic moment <mu_z> is proportional to <S_z>,\n    so it oscillates with the same frequency.\n    \n    omega = gamma * B\n    \n    We now match this result with the provided options.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Represent the derived frequency symbolically\n    # Let g represent gamma and B0 represent B\n    derived_frequency = \"gamma*B\"\n    \n    # Define the given options\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"gamma*B\",\n        \"B\": \"sqrt(2)*gamma*B\",\n        \"C\": \"gamma*B/sqrt(2)\",\n        \"D\": \"gamma*B/2\"\n    }\n    \n    # Find which option matches the derived frequency\n    correct_choice = \"\"\n    for choice, value in options.items():\n        if value == derived_frequency:\n            correct_choice = choice\n            break\n            \n    print(f\"The oscillation frequency omega is derived from the time evolution of the system's quantum state.\")\n    print(f\"The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates as cos(omega*t).\")\n    print(f\"The calculation shows that omega = gamma * B.\")\n    print(f\"Comparing this result to the options:\")\n    print(f\"A) gamma*B\")\n    print(f\"B) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\")\n    print(f\"C) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\")\n    print(f\"D) gamma*B/2\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe correct choice is {correct_choice}.\")\n\nsolve_spin_precession()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
