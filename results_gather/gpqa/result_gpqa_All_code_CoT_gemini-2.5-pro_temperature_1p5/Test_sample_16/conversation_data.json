    "To determine the concentration of calcium ions, we need to analyze the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Write the dissociation reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex dissociates into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($EDTA^{4-}$). The reaction is:\n    $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n2.  **Use the formation constant (K_f) to find the dissociation constant (K_d):** The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    $K_d = 1 / K_f$\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume it dissociates by an amount 'x'. This means the equilibrium concentrations of $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$ will both be 'x', and the concentration of the complex will be `0.02 - x`.\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression for K_d:**\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x:** Since the formation constant is very large, the complex is very stable, meaning very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than 0.02. We can approximate `(0.02 - x)` as `0.02`. This simplifies the equation to:\n    $K_d \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n    We can then rearrange this to solve for 'x', which represents the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # M\nK_formation = 5e10  # Formation constant K_f\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the dissociation constant (K_d)\nK_dissociation = 1 / K_formation\n\n# Step 3 & 4: Set up and solve the simplified equilibrium expression.\n# K_d = x^2 / (initial_conc - x)\n# Since K_f is very large, K_d is very small, so x << initial_conc.\n# We can approximate (initial_conc - x) as initial_conc.\n# K_d ≈ x^2 / initial_conc\n# x^2 ≈ K_d * initial_conc\n# x = sqrt(K_d * initial_conc)\n# x represents the concentration of Ca2+ ions at equilibrium.\n\n# Calculate x^2\nx_squared = K_dissociation * initial_complex_conc\n\n# Calculate x\nca_ion_conc = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# Print the result and the choices\nprint(f\"The dissociation constant (Kd) is: {K_dissociation:.2e} M\")\nprint(f\"The initial concentration of the complex is: {initial_complex_conc} M\")\nprint(f\"The equilibrium concentration of Calcium ions ([Ca2+]) is calculated to be: {ca_ion_conc:.2e} M\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 5.0x10^-3 M\")\nprint(f\"B) 6.3x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"C) 1.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(f\"D) 2.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches option B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```"
