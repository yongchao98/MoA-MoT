    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Principle:** The key to this problem is understanding the geometry of a transit and the definition of the impact parameter, `b`. The impact parameter is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at mid-transit, normalized by the star's radius. A transit event, by a common definition, occurs when the center of the planet passes over the stellar disk, which means `b <= 1`.\n2.  **Determine the Limiting Condition:** We are looking for the *maximum* orbital period for the second planet. According to Kepler's Third Law (`P² ∝ a³`), a larger period (`P`) means a larger orbital distance (`a`, the semi-major axis). The largest possible orbital distance for a transit to occur corresponds to the largest possible impact parameter, which is `b = 1` (a grazing transit of the planet's center). So, for Planet 2, we will use `b₂ = 1`.\n3.  **Relate the Two Planets:** The problem states that both planets share the same orbital plane. This means their orbital inclination (`i`) is the same. The relationship for the impact parameter is `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_star`. We can write this for both planets:\n    *   Planet 1: `b₁ = (a₁ * cos(i)) / R_star`\n    *   Planet 2 (at max period): `b₂ = (a₂ * cos(i)) / R_star`\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Distances:** Since `cos(i)` and `R_star` are the same for both setups, we can create a ratio by dividing the two equations:\n    `b₂ / b₁ = a₂ / a₁`\n    This gives us the ratio of their orbital distances: `a₂ / a₁ = b₂ / b₁`.\n5.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Now we can relate the periods. From Kepler's Third Law, we know:\n    `(P₂ / P₁)² = (a₂ / a₁ )³`\n    Substituting our result from the previous step:\n    `(P₂ / P₁)² = (b₂ / b₁ )³`\n6.  **Calculate the Final Period:** We can now solve for `P₂` using the given values: `P₁ = 3` days, `b₁ = 0.2`, and our limiting condition `b₂ = 1`.\n\nThe provided information about the radii of the star and the planets is not needed for this solution, as those terms cancel out when we establish the ratio.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the known parameters based on the problem description.\n# P1 is the orbital period of the first planet.\nP1 = 3.0  # days\n# b1 is the transit impact parameter of the first planet.\nb1 = 0.2  # dimensionless\n\n# The maximum orbital period for the second planet (P2) occurs at the largest\n# possible orbital distance (a2) that still allows for a transit.\n# A transit is defined as the planet's center passing in front of the star's disk,\n# which corresponds to an impact parameter b <= 1.\n# Therefore, the limiting case for the second planet is an impact parameter b2 = 1.\nb2_max = 1.0\n\n# The impact parameter b is given by b = (a * cos(i)) / R_star, where 'a' is the\n# semi-major axis, 'i' is the inclination, and 'R_star' is the star's radius.\n# Since both planets share the same orbital plane, 'i' is the same for both.\n# We can set up a ratio: (a2 / a1) = (b2 / b1).\n# This gives us the ratio of their semi-major axes.\na_ratio = b2_max / b1\n\n# According to Kepler's Third Law, (P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3.\n# We can solve for P2: P2 = P1 * (a2 / a1)^(3/2).\nP2_max = P1 * math.pow(a_ratio, 1.5)\n\n# Print the final calculated period and the choices to help the user compare.\nprint(f\"The calculated maximum orbital period is: {P2_max:.1f} days\")\nprint(\"\\nAvailable options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~ 33.5\")\nprint(f\"B) ~ 12.5\")\nprint(f\"C) ~ 7.5\")\nprint(f\"D) ~ 37.5\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
