    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) --> A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. The reaction involves a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor), and a strong base (t-BuOK).\n2.  **Michael Donor Formation:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates an α-carbon of the ketone to form an enolate (the Michael donor). The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons:\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    Therefore, the enolate can only form at the C6 position.\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product A Structure & Name:**\n    *   The resulting product has an `-(CH₂-CH₂-COOEt)` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring.\n    *   To name this product, we follow IUPAC rules. The ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. Thus, the molecule is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent on the C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We must number the cyclohexyl ring substituent, starting with C1 at the point of attachment to the propanoate chain.\n        *   The point of attachment is the original C6 of the ketone. This is the **new C1**. It has a methyl group.\n        *   The adjacent carbonyl carbon (original C1) is the **new C2**. It has an oxo group.\n        *   The next carbon (original C2) is the **new C3**. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This narrows down the correct option to either A or D.\n\n**Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) --> B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. It involves a nitroalkane (which has acidic α-protons), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (a Michael acceptor), and a base (KOH).\n2.  **Michael Donor Formation:** The base, KOH, deprotonates the acidic α-proton of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form a nucleophilic nitronate anion.\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN, also known as crotononitrile).\n4.  **Product B Structure & Name:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane moiety and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile moiety.\n    *   The resulting structure is `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`.\n    *   To name this product, the nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group. The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is a six-carbon chain (hexanenitrile).\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This narrows down the correct option to either C or D.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, product A is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`, and product B is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`. This unique combination corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\n# Final evaluation of the options based on the analysis.\n\n# Analysis of Product A:\n# The reaction is a Michael addition at the C6 position of the ketone.\n# Naming the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate gives:\n# ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n# This eliminates options B and C.\n\n# Analysis of Product B:\n# The reaction is a Michael addition between the alpha-carbon of 1-nitropropane\n# and the beta-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n# Naming the product as a substituted hexanenitrile gives:\n# 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n# This eliminates options A and B.\n\n# The only option consistent with both analyses is D.\n\nfinal_choice = \"D\"\n\nprint(\"Step-by-step derivation leads to the following products:\")\nprint(\"Product A: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\")\nprint(\"Product B: 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {final_choice}.\")\nprint(\"<<<D>>>\")\n```"
