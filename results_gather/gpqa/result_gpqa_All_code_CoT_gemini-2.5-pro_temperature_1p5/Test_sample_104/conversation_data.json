    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics**: The problem compares two phenomena that cause a dip in a star's observed brightness: starspots rotating into view and an exoplanet transiting.\n    *   **Starspots**: The spotted hemisphere is cooler than the rest of the star. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the energy radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`F ∝ T⁴`). When the spotted hemisphere rotates into view, the total emitted flux decreases, causing a dip in brightness.\n    *   **Exoplanet Transit**: An exoplanet passing in front of its star blocks a fraction of the star's light. The amount of light blocked is equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area, which simplifies to `(R_planet / R_star)²`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Flux Drop from Spots**: We need to find the relative change in flux between the unspotted hemisphere facing the observer (maximum flux, `F_max`) and the spotted hemisphere facing the observer (minimum flux, `F_min`).\n    *   Let the star's temperature be `T_star` and the spots' temperature be `T_spot`.\n    *   The flux is proportional to `Area * T⁴`. We can ignore constants as they will cancel out.\n    *   `F_max` is proportional to `T_star⁴`.\n    *   The spotted hemisphere has a fraction `f` of its area covered by spots. So, `F_min` is proportional to `(1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n    *   The relative flux drop is `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`. This simplifies to `f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`.\n\n3.  **Equate the Effects**: The problem states that the amplitude of the signal from the spots should be the same as that from a hypothetical exoplanet. Therefore, we set the two expressions for the brightness dip equal to each other:\n    `(R_planet / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n\n4.  **Solve for R_planet / R_star**: We can solve for the relative planet radius by taking the square root of the expression for the spot-induced flux drop.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to perform the calculations using the given values:\n    *   `T_star` = 6000 K\n    *   Spot temperature difference = 1000 K, so `T_spot` = 5000 K\n    *   Spot filling factor `f` = 0.20\n\nThe script will calculate the final ratio `R_planet / R_star` and print it.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Step 1: Define the given parameters ---\n# Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_star = 6000.0\n\n# Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin\nT_diff = 1000.0\n\n# Filling factor of the spots on one hemisphere\nf = 0.20\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the temperature of the spots ---\nT_spot = T_star - T_diff\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the relative flux drop caused by the spots ---\n# The brightness of a star is proportional to T^4 (Stefan-Boltzmann law).\n# The maximum flux (unspotted side) is proportional to T_star^4.\n# The minimum flux (spotted side) is proportional to (1-f)*T_star^4 + f*T_spot^4.\n# The relative flux drop (amplitude) is (F_max - F_min) / F_max.\n# This simplifies to: f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4)\nflux_drop_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\n\n# --- Step 4: Relate the flux drop to an exoplanet transit ---\n# The flux drop from an exoplanet transit is (R_planet / R_star)^2.\n# We set this equal to the flux drop from the spots.\n# (Rpl / Rstar)^2 = flux_drop_spots\n\n# --- Step 5: Solve for the relative radius of the planet (Rpl / Rstar) ---\n# We take the square root of the flux drop.\nrpl_rstar = math.sqrt(flux_drop_spots)\n\n# --- Step 6: Print the final result and compare with the options ---\nprint(\"The physical parameters are:\")\nprint(f\"Star Temperature (T_star): {T_star} K\")\nprint(f\"Spot Temperature (T_spot): {T_spot} K\")\nprint(f\"Spot Filling Factor (f): {f}\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the equivalent exoplanet size...\")\nprint(f\"The relative flux drop caused by the spots is: {flux_drop_spots:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The required planet-to-star radius ratio (R_pl/R_star) is the square root of this value.\")\nprint(f\"Calculated R_pl/R_star = {rpl_rstar:.4f}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing the result to the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) ~0.11\")\nprint(\"B) ~0.39\")\nprint(\"C) ~0.32\")\nprint(\"D) ~0.07\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {rpl_rstar:.2f} is closest to option C.\")\n\n<<<C>>>\n```"
