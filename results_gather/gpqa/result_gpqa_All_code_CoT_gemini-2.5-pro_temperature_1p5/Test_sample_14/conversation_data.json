    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star on a circular orbit is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_star`) to the planet's semi-major axis (`a`).\n    *   `Probability ∝ R_star / a`\n\n2.  **Relate semi-major axis to known quantities:** The semi-major axis (`a`) is not directly given. However, we can use Kepler's Third Law, which relates `a` to the orbital period (`P`) and the host star's mass (`M_star`). The simplified law states:\n    *   `P² ∝ a³ / M_star`\n    *   Rearranging for `a`, we get: `a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n3.  **Combine the formulas:** Substitute the expression for `a` into the probability formula.\n    *   `Probability ∝ R_star / (M_star * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the ratio of probabilities:** We need to find the ratio of the probability for Planet_1 (`Prob_1`) to that of Planet_2 (`Prob_2`).\n    *   `Ratio = Prob_1 / Prob_2 = [R_star_1 / (M_star_1 * P_1²)^(1/3)] / [R_star_2 / (M_star_2 * P_2²)^(1/3)]`\n\n5.  **Substitute the given relationships:**\n    *   Host star radii are equal: `R_star_1 = R_star_2`\n    *   Host star mass relationship: `M_star_1 = 2 * M_star_2`\n    *   Orbital period relationship: `P_2 = 3 * P_1`\n\n6.  **Simplify and compute:** By substituting these relationships into the ratio formula, we can calculate the numerical factor by which one planet's transit probability is higher than the other. The Python code below will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Step 1: Define the relationships based on the problem statement ---\n# Let's set the parameters for Planet_2's system as our baseline.\n# The exact values don't matter, only their ratios.\nM_star_2 = 1.0  # Mass of Planet_2's host star\nR_star_2 = 1.0  # Radius of Planet_2's host star\nP_2 = 3.0       # Orbital period of Planet_2\n\n# Now, define the parameters for Planet_1's system based on the given ratios.\nM_star_1 = 2 * M_star_2\nR_star_1 = R_star_2  # Radii are the same\nP_1 = P_2 / 3\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the term proportional to the semi-major axis 'a' for each planet ---\n# From Kepler's Third Law, a is proportional to (M_star * P^2)^(1/3).\n# We calculate the term inside the parenthesis first: (M_star * P^2)\na_prop_term_1 = M_star_1 * (P_1**2)\na_prop_term_2 = M_star_2 * (P_2**2)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the term proportional to the transit probability for each planet ---\n# Probability is proportional to R_star / a, which is R_star / (M_star * P^2)^(1/3).\nprob_prop_1 = R_star_1 / (a_prop_term_1**(1/3))\nprob_prop_2 = R_star_2 / (a_prop_term_2**(1/3))\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the ratio of the probabilities ---\n# This tells us how many times more likely Planet_1 is to transit than Planet_2.\nprobability_ratio = prob_prop_1 / prob_prop_2\n\n# --- Step 5: Print the results and the correct choice ---\nprint(f\"The ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to Planet_2 is: {probability_ratio:.2f}\")\nprint(\"This means Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\")\nprint(\"The correct option is B.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
