    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between peak wavelength and temperature:** The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. According to Wien's Displacement Law for black bodies (λ_max = b/T, where λ_max is the peak wavelength, b is a constant, and T is the surface temperature), if the peak wavelengths are equal, their surface temperatures (T1 and T2) must also be equal.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between luminosity, radius, and temperature:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature.\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio of luminosities:** We need to find the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, which is the ratio L1 / L2.\n    *   L1 = 4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴\n    *   L2 = 4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴\n    *   The ratio is (4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴) / (4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴).\n\n4.  **Simplify the ratio:** Since the constants (4, π, σ) cancel out and we've established that T1 = T2, the temperature terms (T1⁴ and T2⁴) also cancel out. The equation simplifies to:\n    *   L1 / L2 = R1² / R2² = (R1 / R2)²\n\n5.  **Substitute the given values:** We are given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2, so R1 / R2 = 1.5.\n\n6.  **Compute the final result:** Calculate (1.5)², which will give the luminosity ratio. The information about mass and radial velocity is not needed for this calculation and can be considered extra detail.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the given ratio of the radii.\n# R1 is the radius of Star_1 and R2 is the radius of Star_2.\n# We are given R1 = 1.5 * R2.\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n\n# Step 2: Understand the implications of the given information.\n# The problem states the stars' peak emission wavelengths are the same.\n# According to Wien's Displacement Law (λ_max = b/T), if the peak wavelengths (λ_max)\n# are equal, the surface temperatures (T) must also be equal. So, T1 = T2.\n# The information about mass and radial velocity is not relevant to the luminosity calculation\n# based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a black body.\n\n# Step 3: Use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law to find the luminosity ratio.\n# The luminosity (L) of a star is given by L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴.\n# We want to find the ratio L1 / L2.\n# L1 / L2 = (4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴) / (4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴)\n# Since T1 = T2, the T⁴ terms cancel out. The constants (4, π, σ) also cancel.\n# The ratio simplifies to L1 / L2 = R1² / R2² = (R1 / R2)².\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final luminosity ratio.\nluminosity_ratio = radius_ratio ** 2\n\n# Print the result and the available choices to determine the correct answer.\nprint(f\"The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of: {luminosity_ratio}\")\nprint(\"\\nChoices:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~2.23\")\nprint(f\"B) ~2.32\")\nprint(f\"C) ~2.25\")\nprint(f\"D) ~2.35\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches choice C.\")\n\n<<<C>>>\n```"
