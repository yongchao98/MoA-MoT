    "My plan is to determine the correct transition route and its probability based on the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions in a Hydrogen atom.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Selection Rules**: First, I will state the E1 selection rules, which govern which transitions are allowed. These rules are $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. The principal quantum number $n$ must also change.\n2.  **Verify the Transition Routes**: I will apply these rules to the proposed two-step decay: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. I will confirm that both steps in the routes listed in the options are allowed by the selection rules.\n3.  **Calculate the Probabilities**: The core of the problem is to determine the probability of each route. For a cascade decay, the probability of a specific path is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, assuming the second step is guaranteed (which it is, as the $2p$ state can only decay to the $1s$ state). The branching ratio depends on the transition rates.\n4.  **Evaluate Transition Rates**: I will use the fact that the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). For spontaneous emission from such a state, the transition rates to each of the possible magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the final $l'=1$ state are identical.\n5.  **Determine Branching Ratios**: Since there are three equally probable intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$), the probability of branching into any single one of them is $1/3$.\n6.  **Select the Correct Option**: Finally, I will compare this result with the given options to find the one that correctly pairs a valid route with the calculated probability of $1/3$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_h_atom_decay():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of H-atom cascade decay from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0>.\n\n    The function applies the selection rules for electric dipole transitions and\n    calculates the probability of the specified decay routes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the problem and selection rules\n    initial_state = \"|3,0,0>\"\n    final_state = \"|1,0,0>\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing the two-step dipole transition from {initial_state} to {final_state}.\")\n    print(\"The selection rules for an electric dipole (E1) transition are:\")\n    print(\"Δl = ±1\")\n    print(\"Δm = 0, ±1\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the proposed transition routes\n    print(\"The decay proceeds through an intermediate state, specified in the options as |2,1,m'>.\")\n\n    # First transition: |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m'>\n    # l=0 -> l'=1 satisfies Δl = +1.\n    # m=0 -> m' can be -1, 0, or 1, which satisfies Δm = -1, 0, +1.\n    # n=3 -> n'=2 means energy is released.\n    # This step is valid.\n\n    # Second transition: |2,1,m'> -> |1,0,0>\n    # l'=1 -> l''=0 satisfies Δl = -1.\n    # m' -> m''=0 implies Δm = -m'.
