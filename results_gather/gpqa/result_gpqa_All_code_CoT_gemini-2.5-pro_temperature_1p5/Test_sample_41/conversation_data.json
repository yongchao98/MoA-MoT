    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Radius**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is related to its orbital radius ($a$) by the formula $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$, assuming the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo. This means that the ratio of two planets' temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their orbital radii: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Orbital Radius Ratios**: We can rearrange the formula from Step 1 to solve for the ratio of the orbital radii: $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^2$. We will apply this to find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ and $\\frac{a_3}{a_2}$ using the given temperature ratios. Note that the mass ratios and specific albedo value are not needed for this calculation, as the albedo is constant for all planets.\n\n3.  **Find the Overall Radius Ratio**: To find the ratio of the orbital radius of Planet3 to Planet1 ($\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$), we will multiply the individual ratios calculated in the previous step: $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$.\n\n4.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law**: Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of its orbital radius ($a$), or $P^2 \\propto a^3$. This implies $P \\propto a^{3/2}$. Therefore, the ratio of the periods can be found from the ratio of the radii: $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{a_3}{a_1}\\right)^{3/2}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Factor**: We will substitute the overall radius ratio from Step 3 into the formula from Step 4 to compute the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Define given temperature ratios and calculate orbital radius ratios.\n# The equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), where 'a' is the orbital radius.\n# So, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1), which means a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2.\nT_ratio_12 = 1.4  # T1 / T2\nT_ratio_23 = 2.3  # T2 / T3\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital radii (a2/a1) and (a3/a2).\na_ratio_21 = T_ratio_12 ** 2\na_ratio_32 = T_ratio_23 ** 2\n\n# Step 3: Find the overall radius ratio (a3/a1).\n# a3/a1 = (a3/a2) * (a2/a1)\na_ratio_31 = a_ratio_32 * a_ratio_21\n\n# Step 4: Apply Kepler's Third Law to find the period ratio (P3/P1).\n# P is proportional to a^(3/2), so P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2).\nperiod_ratio_31 = a_ratio_31 ** (3/2)\n\n# Step 5: Print the final result and the options for comparison.\nprint(f\"The calculated factor is: {period_ratio_31:.1f}\")\nprint(\"Which corresponds to option:\")\nprint(\"A) ~ 33.4\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 10.4\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 4.4\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 3.2\")\n<<<A>>>\n```"
