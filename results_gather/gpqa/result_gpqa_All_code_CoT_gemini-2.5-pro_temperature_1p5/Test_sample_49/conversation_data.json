    "In quantum field theory, particularly when using dimensional regularization, each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor to the overall amplitude. In a four-dimensional spacetime (D=4), each loop integral introduces a factor of `1/(4π)^(D/2)`, which simplifies to `1/(4π)^2`.\n\nThe problem is to determine the number of loops, which we'll call `L`. The total loop factor in the expression will be `(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nBy inspecting the provided expression, `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`, we can see the term `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\nWe can set up an equation to solve for `L`:\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving this simple equation will give us the number of loops in the diagram.\n\n```python\n# The expression for a Feynman diagram's amplitude contains clues about its structure.\n# One of the most direct clues for the number of loops is the power of the (4pi) term\n# that arises from loop integrals in dimensional regularization.\n\n# In D-dimensional spacetime, each loop contributes a factor of 1 / (4pi)^(D/2).\n# The problem states the theory is on four-dimensional spacetime.\nspacetime_dimensions = 4\n\n# The power of the (4pi) term from one loop is therefore D/2.\npower_per_loop = spacetime_dimensions / 2\n\n# From the given expression, we identify the term 1/(4pi)^6.\n# This means the total power of the (4pi) term in the denominator is 6.\ntotal_power_of_4pi = 6\n\n# The total number of loops (L) can be found by the relation:\n# L * power_per_loop = total_power_of_4pi\n# L * 2 = 6\nnumber_of_loops = total_power_of_4pi / power_per_loop\n\n# The choices are:\n# A) 2\n# B) 6\n# C) 3\n# D) 1\n\n# We print the calculated number of loops and determine the corresponding choice.\nprint(f\"The number of loops in the Feynman diagram is: {int(number_of_loops)}\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to choice C.\")\n\n# Final answer selection\nfinal_choice = \"C\"\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer Code: <<<{final_choice}>>>\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
