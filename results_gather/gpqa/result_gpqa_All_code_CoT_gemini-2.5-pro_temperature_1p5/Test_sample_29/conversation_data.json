    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we first need to find the color of the light it emits. The color we see is the color of emitted light, and the color absorbed is its complementary color.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  **Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light:** We are given the energy (E) of the emitted light, which is 2.3393 eV. We can calculate the corresponding wavelength (λ) using the formula λ = hc/E. A simplified version of this formula uses the constant hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm, making the calculation straightforward: λ (nm) = 1240 / E (eV).\n2.  **Determine the Color of Emitted Light:** We'll use the calculated wavelength to find the corresponding color in the visible spectrum. For reference, the visible spectrum ranges from approximately 380 nm (violet) to 750 nm (red).\n3.  **Find the Absorbed (Complementary) Color:** The color of light absorbed by a substance is complementary to the color it emits. For example, the complementary color of green is red.\n4.  **Select the Correct Option:** We will match the absorbed color to the given choices to find the correct answer.\n\nThe following Python code will execute these steps to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Capture original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = buffer = io.StringIO()\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and given energy\nE_eV = 2.3393  # Energy of emitted light in eV\nhc_eV_nm = 1240  # Planck's constant * speed of light in eV·nm\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light\nlambda_emitted_nm = hc_eV_nm / E_eV\n\n# Step 3: Determine the color of the emitted light based on its wavelength\n# Visible Spectrum (approximate ranges in nm):\n# Violet: 380-450\n# Blue:   450-495\n# Green:  495-570\n# Yellow: 570-590\n# Orange: 590-620\n# Red:    620-750\nemitted_color = \"\"\nif 380 <= lambda_emitted_nm < 450:\n    emitted_color = \"Violet\"\nelif 450 <= lambda_emitted_nm < 495:\n    emitted_color = \"Blue\"\nelif 495 <= lambda_emitted_nm < 570:\n    emitted_color = \"Green\"\nelif 570 <= lambda_emitted_nm < 590:\n    emitted_color = \"Yellow\"\nelif 590 <= lambda_emitted_nm < 620:\n    emitted_color = \"Orange\"\nelif 620 <= lambda_emitted_nm <= 750:\n    emitted_color = \"Red\"\n\n# Step 4: Determine the absorbed color (complementary color)\n# A simplified color wheel shows these pairs:\n# Red <-> Green\n# Blue <-> Orange\n# Violet <-> Yellow\ncomplementary_colors = {\n    \"Red\": \"Green\",\n    \"Orange\": \"Blue\",\n    \"Yellow\": \"Violet\",\n    \"Green\": \"Red\",\n    \"Blue\": \"Orange\",\n    \"Violet\": \"Yellow\"\n}\nabsorbed_color = complementary_colors.get(emitted_color, \"Unknown\")\n\n# Step 5: Match the absorbed color with the given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"Yellow\",\n    \"B\": \"Blue\",\n    \"C\": \"Violet\",\n    \"D\": \"Red\"\n}\nfinal_answer_letter = \"\"\nfor letter, color in options.items():\n    if color == absorbed_color:\n        final_answer_letter = letter\n        break\n\n# The emitted wavelength is ~530 nm (Green).\n# The complementary/absorbed color is Red.\n# The option for Red is D.\nprint(final_answer_letter)\n\n# Restore original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Get the output from the buffer\noutput = buffer.getvalue()\n\n# Final print to the user\nprint(output)\n```\n<<<D>>>"
