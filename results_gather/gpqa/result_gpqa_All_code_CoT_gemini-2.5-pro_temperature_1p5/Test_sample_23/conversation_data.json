    "Of course, I can help you solve this chemistry puzzle. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** The first step is to determine the chemical formula of substance Z.\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, meaning it only contains Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7 (~0.142857).\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons, using approximate atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1).\n        *   For an acyclic alkane (CnH(2n+2)): Mass % H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). This doesn't simplify to 1/7 for any integer n.\n        *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): Mass % H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7. This is a perfect match.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z. This implies all compounds involved have the same carbon skeleton. Since Z is a common solvent and a cycloalkane, it is almost certainly **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids and does not decolorize bromine water (meaning it's saturated or aromatic).\n    *   Substance Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a component of Y.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. Disproportionation is a redox reaction. In this catalytic context, it means some molecules are hydrogenated (reduced) and some are dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   The fully dehydrogenated, stable C6 ring compound that doesn't react with bromine water is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mix of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   We can check this: Hydrogenating this mixture (benzene + cyclohexane) would convert the benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only one substance: cyclohexane (Z). This fits the problem description.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X and Find the Answer:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that is converted to mixture Y. The overall reaction is a hydrogen transfer.\n    *   `Mixture X (X1 + X2) -> Mixture Y (Benzene + Cyclohexane)`\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which means the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2.\n    *   Total H atoms in Mixture Y = (H atoms in one molecule of benzene) + (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane)\n    *   Total H atoms = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n    (For completeness, the two liquids in mixture X must be C6 cycloalkenes that add up to C12H18. The logical candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), as 10 + 8 = 18. Both have non-conjugated double bonds and would hydrogenate to cyclohexane).\n\nNow, I will provide the Python code to formalize the final calculation.\n\n```python\n# The solution is based on logical deduction from the problem's chemical principles.\n# The code below formalizes the final calculation step based on these deductions.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the components of mixture Y.\n# From the problem analysis, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene.\n# We define the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\n# Component 1 of Y: Cyclohexane (C6H12). This is substance Z.\nh_atoms_in_cyclohexane = 12\n\n# Component 2 of Y: Benzene (C6H6). This is the dehydrogenated product.\nh_atoms_in_benzene = 6\n\n# Step 2: Apply the law of conservation of atoms.\n# The conversion of mixture X to mixture Y is a disproportionation (hydrogen transfer) reaction.\n# Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms is conserved between the reactants (X) and products (Y).\n# Total H in (X1 + X2) = Total H in (Y1 + Y2)\ntotal_hydrogen_atoms = h_atoms_in_cyclohexane + h_atoms_in_benzene\n\n# Step 3: Print the result.\n# The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\nprint(\"The analysis leads to the conclusion that mixture Y consists of Cyclohexane (12 H atoms) and Benzene (6 H atoms).\")\nprint(\"Due to the conservation of atoms in the reaction, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must be the same.\")\nprint(f\"Total hydrogen atoms = {h_atoms_in_cyclohexane} + {h_atoms_in_benzene} = {total_hydrogen_atoms}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the given choices:\")\nprint(\"A) 16\")\nprint(\"B) 18\")\nprint(\"C) 22\")\nprint(\"D) 12\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches choice B.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
