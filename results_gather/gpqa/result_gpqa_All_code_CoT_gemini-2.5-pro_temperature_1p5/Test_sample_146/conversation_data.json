    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The process is governed by the conservation of energy. Since the resulting particles are expected to move at high speeds, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n2.  **Calculate the initial energy ($E_{initial}$):** The system initially consists of a proton and an antiproton. The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. To conserve momentum (assuming the total momentum is initially zero), we can consider both particles to be effectively at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies.\n    *   Rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$): ~938.3 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of an antiproton is identical.\n    *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n3.  **Define the final energy ($E_{final}$):** The final state has four particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$). By symmetry, they will all move with the same speed, $v$. The total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Rest energy of one A particle ($m_A c^2$): 300 MeV\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:** Set $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n    *   $2 \\times m_p c^2 = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times m_A c^2$\n5.  **Solve for velocity:** I will first solve the equation for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$. Then, I will use the relationship $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$ to find the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = v/c$.\n6.  **Compare and conclude:** Finally, I'll compare the calculated value of $\\beta$ with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Define constants and calculate initial energy\n# Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.272\n# Total initial energy (proton + antiproton)\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Step 3: Define final state parameters\n# Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300.0\n# Number of final particles\nn_A = 4\n\n# Step 4: Apply energy conservation to find the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# E_initial = E_final  =>  2 * m_p_c2 = n_A * gamma * m_A_c2\n# gamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (n_A * m_A_c2)\ngamma = E_initial / (n_A * m_A_c2)\n\n# Step 5: Solve for velocity (beta = v/c) from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma**2))\n\n# Step 6: Print the results and options\nprint(f\"The calculated Lorentz factor (gamma) is: {gamma:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated velocity of particle A (as a fraction of c) is: {beta:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 0.77c\")\nprint(f\"B) 0.86c\")\nprint(f\"C) 0.96c\")\nprint(f\"D) 0.91c\")\n\n# Determine the closest choice\noptions = {'A': 0.77, 'B': 0.86, 'C': 0.96, 'D': 0.91}\nclosest_choice = min(options, key=lambda x: abs(options[x] - beta))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {beta:.2f}c is closest to option {closest_choice}.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
