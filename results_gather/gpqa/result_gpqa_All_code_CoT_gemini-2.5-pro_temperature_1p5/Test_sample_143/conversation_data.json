    "To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Constants and Given Values**: We need the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar$), the speed of light (c), and the given energy ($E_X$), mass ($m_X$), and decay width ($\\Gamma_X$). It's most convenient to use the combined constant $\\hbar c$. We will convert all energy units to a consistent unit (MeV).\n    *   $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV}\\cdot\\text{fm} = 197.327 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ MeV}\\cdot\\text{m}$\n\n2.  **Use the appropriate formula**: The mean decay distance ($L$) in the lab frame is given by the particle's speed multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame ($L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$). This can be expressed in a more convenient form using energy, momentum, and decay width:\n    $L = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $p$ is the momentum of the particle.\n\n3.  **Calculate the momentum ($pc$)**: We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\n\n4.  **Substitute and Solve**: We will plug the values into the formula to calculate the final distance $L$.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated distance will be compared to the given multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define physical constants and input parameters.\n# The value of hbar*c is approximately 197.327 MeV*fm, where 1 fm = 1e-15 m.\nhbar_c = 197.327e-15  # in units of MeV*m\n\n# Given values for the meson X.\nE_X_GeV = 8.0     # Production energy in GeV\nm_X_GeV = 1.2     # Mass in GeV (implies m*c^2)\nGamma_X_MeV = 320.0 # Decay width in MeV\n\n# Convert all energy-related values to MeV for consistency.\nE_X = E_X_GeV * 1000      # Total energy in MeV\nm_X_c2 = m_X_GeV * 1000   # Rest mass energy in MeV\nGamma_X = Gamma_X_MeV   # Decay width in MeV\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the momentum term (pc) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n# E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2  =>  pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m*c^2)^2)\ntry:\n    pc = math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X_c2**2)\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Error: Energy must be greater than mass for a moving particle.\")\n    exit()\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance (L) using the derived formula.\n# L = (pc / m_X_c2) * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\nmean_decay_distance = (pc / m_X_c2) * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\n\n# Step 4: Present the final result and compare with the given options.\nprint(f\"The calculated mean decay distance is: {mean_decay_distance:.4e} m\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe options are:\")\nprint(\"A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\")\nprint(\"B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\")\nprint(\"C) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\")\nprint(\"D) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\")\n\n# The calculated value corresponds to option B.\nprint(\"\\nThe correct option is B.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
