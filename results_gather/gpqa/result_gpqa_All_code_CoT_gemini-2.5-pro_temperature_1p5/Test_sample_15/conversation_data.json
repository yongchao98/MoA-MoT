    "To determine which of the given compounds are optically active, we need to assess the chirality of each molecule. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The presence of stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), or a specific named enantiomer is a strong indicator of optical activity, unless the compound is meso.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze each compound for chirality:**\n    *   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a double bond. There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms with four different substituents). The molecule is planar and thus superimposable on its mirror image (achiral). It is optically **inactive**.\n    *   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name itself specifies a single, complex stereoisomer with (R) and (S) configurations. Such a molecule is a single enantiomer, which is by definition chiral and optically **active**. The structure is too complex and asymmetric to be a meso compound.\n    *   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric (HOOC- and -COOH at the ends). The (R,S) configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers. It is optically **inactive**.\n    *   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. Both chiral centers have the same (R) configuration. It lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image, (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Therefore, it is chiral and optically **active**.\n    *   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at C1. The carbon atom C1 is bonded to -OH, -H, -CH2-CH=, and -CH=CH-CH2- groups, which are four different groups. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the compound is chiral and optically **active**.\n    *   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This molecule possesses three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and bisecting the opposite C-C bond. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral. It is optically **inactive**.\n    *   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** Let's look for a chiral center. The structure is (cyclopentyl)-CO-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups, so it's not a chiral center. No other carbon is chiral. The molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **Count the optically active compounds:**\n    Based on the analysis, three compounds are optically active:\n    *   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    *   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, the correct count is 3.\n\n```python\ndef solve_optical_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are optically active.\n    \"\"\"\n    compounds = {\n        \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\": {\n            \"active\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"This molecule is planar and has no chiral centers, making it achiral.\"\n        },\n        \"(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\": {\n            \"active\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"The name specifies a single enantiomer with R and S configurations.
