    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan to Solve the Problem\n\n1.  **Identify the Physics:** The problem describes pair production, where two photons annihilate to create an electron-positron pair: $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$. We need to find the minimum energy (the threshold energy) of the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) for this process to occur.\n\n2.  **Use Relativistic Invariants:** The key principle is the conservation of four-momentum. The square of the total four-momentum, known as the Mandelstam variable 's', is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it's the same in all inertial reference frames. We can calculate 's' in the laboratory frame and the center-of-mass frame and equate them.\n\n3.  **Calculation in the Center-of-Mass (CM) Frame:** At the threshold energy, the electron and positron are created with zero kinetic energy in the CM frame. Therefore, the total energy in the CM frame is simply the sum of the rest mass energies of the electron and positron, which is $E_{CM} = 2 m_e c^2$. The squared invariant mass is $s = (E_{CM})^2 = (2 m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n4.  **Calculation in the Laboratory Frame:** In the lab frame, we have a high-energy photon with energy $E_\\gamma$ and a CMB photon with energy $\\epsilon_{CMB}$. The threshold for $E_\\gamma$ is lowest when the two photons have a head-on collision. In this case, the squared invariant mass is $s = 4 E_\\gamma \\epsilon_{CMB}$.\n\n5.  **Derive the Threshold Energy Formula:** By equating the expressions for 's' from both frames, we get:\n    $4 E_\\gamma \\epsilon_{CMB} = (2 m_e c^2)^2 = 4 (m_e c^2)^2$\n    Solving for $E_\\gamma$, we find the threshold energy:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\\epsilon_{CMB}}$\n\n6.  **Execute the Calculation:** I will write a Python script to plug in the known values and calculate the result.\n    *   Electron rest mass energy, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Average CMB photon energy, $\\epsilon_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$ (as given in the problem).\n\nThe script will calculate $E_\\gamma$ in electron-volts (eV) and then convert it to Giga-electron-volts (GeV) to compare with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_gamma_ray_threshold():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray to annihilate\n    with a CMB photon, producing an electron-positron pair.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define physical constants ---\n    # Electron rest mass energy in electron-volts (eV). 0.511 MeV = 0.511 * 1e6 eV.\n    m_e_c2_ev = 0.511e6\n    \n    # Average energy of a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon in eV, as given.\n    epsilon_cmb_ev = 1e-3\n\n    # Conversion factor from eV to GeV\n    EV_PER_GEV = 1e9\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate the threshold energy using the derived formula ---\n    # The formula for the threshold energy (E_gamma) is: E_gamma = (m_e*c^2)^2 / epsilon_cmb\n    # This is derived by equating the invariant mass in the lab frame (for a head-on collision)\n    # and the center-of-mass frame (at rest).\n    e_gamma_ev = (m_e_c2_ev ** 2) / epsilon_cmb_ev\n\n    # --- Step 3: Convert the result to Giga-electron-volts (GeV) ---\n    e_gamma_gev = e_gamma_ev / EV_PER_GEV\n\n    # --- Step 4: Print the results and compare with options ---\n    print(\"Calculation of the gamma-ray energy threshold for pair production with CMB photons.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"Electron rest mass energy (m_e*c^2): {m_e_c2_ev:.3e} eV\")\n    print(f\"CMB photon energy (epsilon_cmb): {epsilon_cmb_ev:.3e} eV\")\n    print(f\"\\nDerived threshold energy (E_gamma) = (m_e*c^2)^2 / epsilon_cmb\")\n    print(f\"Calculated threshold energy: {e_gamma_ev:.3e} eV\")\n    print(f\"Calculated threshold energy: {e_gamma_gev:.3e} GeV\")\n    \n    # The options provided in the problem\n    options = {\n        \"A\": 3.9e5,\n        \"B\": 9.5e4,\n        \"C\": 2.6e5,\n        \"D\": 1.8e5\n    }\n    \n    print(\"\\nComparing the result with the given options:\")\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{key}) {value:.1e} GeV\")\n    \n    # Find the closest option\n    closest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - e_gamma_gev))\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated value of {e_gamma_gev:.2e} GeV is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\n\n# Run the calculation\nsolve_gamma_ray_threshold()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
