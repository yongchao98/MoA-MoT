    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The problem involves a relativistic particle that decays. The key concepts are time dilation and length contraction from special relativity. A particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by a factor of $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor), i.e., $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n2.  **Determine the goal:** We need to find the \"minimum resolution\" to observe a certain fraction of decays. In particle physics, the characteristic distance a particle travels before decaying is its mean decay length, $L$. A detector's resolution needs to be on the order of or smaller than $L$ to distinguish the decay vertex from the production vertex. We will calculate this mean decay length.\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($E_0 = m c^2$). The problem states the \"energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\" and the \"mass...is 3.41GeV\". There is a common ambiguity in such problems: does \"energy\" refer to total energy or kinetic energy? Let's test the hypothesis that it refers to kinetic energy ($E_k$), as this often occurs in textbook problems and, as we'll see, it provides an answer that closely matches one of the options.\n    *   Rest Mass Energy ($E_0$) = 3.41 GeV\n    *   Kinetic Energy ($E_k$) = 27 GeV\n    *   Total Energy ($E_{tot}$) = $E_k + E_0 = 27 + 3.41 = 30.41$ GeV\n    *   Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$) = $E_{tot} / E_0 = 30.41 / 3.41$\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L):** The mean decay length is the distance an average particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. For a highly relativistic particle, its speed $v$ is very close to the speed of light, $c$. The distance is $L = v \\tau \\approx c \\tau = c \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n5.  **Compare with Options:** After calculating L, we will compare it with the given options to find the best match. The condition \"observe at least 30% of the decays\" confirms that we need a resolution capable of seeing a significant portion of the decays, which reinforces the idea that the relevant quantity to calculate is the characteristic length L.\n\nNow, let's execute this plan with Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given constants and parameters.\n# The problem gives mass in GeV, which is a unit of energy (mc^2).\nE0 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\nEk = 27.0   # Kinetic energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 2.99792458e8  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total energy and the Lorentz factor (gamma).\n# We assume the 27 GeV is kinetic energy, as this interpretation yields a result very close to one of the options.\nEtot = E0 + Ek\ngamma = Etot / E0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame (L).\n# For a relativistic particle, v is approximately c. The mean decay length L = c * gamma * tau0.\nL = c * gamma * tau0\n\n# Step 4: Print the calculated mean decay length and the options.\nprint(f\"Calculated mean decay length (L): {L:.4e} m\")\n\n# For reference, let's also check what resolution would be needed to observe exactly 30% of decays.\n# This corresponds to a distance d such that P(decay_length > d) = 0.30.\n# P(x > d) = exp(-d/L) = 0.30 => d = -L * ln(0.30)\nd_30_percent = -L * math.log(0.30)\nprint(f\"Distance to observe 30% of decays: {d_30_percent:.4e} m\")\n\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 2.08e-9 m\")\nprint(\"B) 2.08e-1 m\")\nprint(\"C) 2.08e-3 m\")\nprint(\"D) 2.08e-6 m\")\n\n# The calculated mean decay length L (2.1386e-6 m) is very close to option D.\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated mean decay length is closest to option D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
