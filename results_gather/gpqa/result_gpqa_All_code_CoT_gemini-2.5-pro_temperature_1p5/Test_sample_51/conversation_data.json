    "Here is my plan to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical law:** The question asks for the ratio of the population of two energy levels in a system assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n2.  **Formulate the ratios:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms `N_j/N_i` in two energy levels `j` and `i`:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))`\n    where `g` is the statistical weight, `E` is the energy, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n3.  **Set up the problem:** We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. Let `Ratio_unspotted` be the population ratio at `T_unspotted = 6000 K` and `Ratio_spotted` be the ratio at `T_spotted = 5500 K`. The problem asks for the factor `F = Ratio_unspotted / Ratio_spotted`.\n4.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `F = [ (g_2/g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_unspotted)) ] / [ (g_2/g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_spotted)) ]`\n    The statistical weights `(g_2/g_1)` cancel out, leaving:\n    `F = exp(-ΔE / (k*T_unspotted)) / exp(-ΔE / (k*T_spotted))`\n    This simplifies using the properties of exponents to:\n    `F = exp( - (ΔE/k) * (1/T_unspotted - 1/T_spotted) )`\n5.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE):** The energy difference `ΔE` is related to the transition wavelength `λ` by the formula `ΔE = h * c / λ`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n6.  **Code the solution:** I will write a Python script to:\n    *   Define the physical constants (`h`, `c`, `k`).\n    *   Define the given parameters (`T_unspotted`, `T_spotted`, `λ`).\n    *   Calculate `ΔE`.\n    *   Calculate the final factor `F`.\n    *   Print the result along with the options for comparison.\n\nNote that the star's radius and mass are extra information not needed for this specific calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_population_ratio_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the factor by which the ratio of two energy level populations\n    of Ti I changes when a star's photosphere cools due to starspots.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical constants in SI units\n    h = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J*s\n    c = 2.99792458e8     # Speed of light in m/s\n    k = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n    # Given parameters\n    T_unspotted = 6000.0  # Temperature without spots in K\n    T_spotted = 5500.0    # Temperature with spots in K\n    lambda_A = 1448.0     # Wavelength in Angstroms\n\n    # Convert wavelength from Angstroms to meters\n    lambda_m = lambda_A * 1e-10\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the energy difference (delta_E) between the two levels\n    # delta_E = h * c / lambda\n    delta_E = h * c / lambda_m\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the exponent for the unspotted star case\n    # exponent_unspotted = -delta_E / (k * T_unspotted)\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the exponent for the spotted star case\n    # exponent_spotted = -delta_E / (k * T_spotted)\n    \n    # Step 4: The factor is the ratio of the Boltzmann factors, which simplifies to:\n    # Factor = exp(exponent_unspotted) / exp(exponent_spotted)\n    # Factor = exp(exponent_unspotted - exponent_spotted)\n    # Factor = exp( -delta_E/k * (1/T_unspotted - 1/T_spotted) )\n    \n    factor = math.exp(-(delta_E / k) * (1 / T_unspotted - 1 / T_spotted))\n\n    print(\"This problem is solved using the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms in various energy states at a specific temperature.\")\n    print(f\"The temperature of the star without spots is {T_unspotted} K.\")\n    print(f\"The temperature of the star with spots is {T_spotted} K.\")\n    print(f\"The transition wavelength is {lambda_A} Å, which corresponds to an energy difference of {delta_E:.4e} J.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe factor by which the ratio of the number of atoms in the two energetic levels changes is calculated.\")\n    print(f\"Factor = {factor:.2f}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\n    print(\"A) ~1.1\")\n    print(\"B) ~4.5\")\n    print(\"C) ~2.9\")\n    print(\"D) ~7.8\")\n\ncalculate_population_ratio_factor()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
