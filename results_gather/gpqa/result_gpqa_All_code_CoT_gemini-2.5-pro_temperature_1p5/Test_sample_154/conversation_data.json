    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the uncertainty of the operator $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a system in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula:** The uncertainty of an operator $A$ is given by the standard deviation formula from quantum mechanics:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    For our case, this becomes:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n3.  **Define the Quantities:**\n    *   The matrix for the operator $P_z$ is given: $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The state of the system (a column vector) is given: $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The corresponding \"bra\" vector is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all components are real, it's just the transpose: $\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation Plan:**\n    *   **Step 4a: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.**\n        The expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$. I will perform this matrix multiplication.\n    *   **Step 4b: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.**\n        First, I'll find the matrix for $P_z^2$ by squaring the matrix for $P_z$. Then, I'll calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    *   **Step 4c: Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.**\n        I will substitute the values of $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ into the uncertainty formula.\n\n5.  **Finalize the Answer:** I will compare the calculated value of $\\Delta P_z$ with the given options (A, B, C, D) and select the correct one. For calculation purposes, I will set $\\hbar=1$ and reintroduce it in the final result.\n\nI will use the `numpy` library in Python to handle the matrix and vector operations efficiently.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_uncertainty():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the uncertainty Delta P_z for the given quantum state and operator.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For calculation, we can set hbar = 1 and add it back at the end.\n    # The matrix P_z (with hbar=1)\n    P_z = np.array([[1, 0, 0],\n                    [0, 0, 0],\n                    [0, 0, -1]], dtype=float)\n\n    # The state vector |psi>\n    psi = np.array([[-1/2],\n                    [1/np.sqrt(2)],\n                    [-1/2]], dtype=float)\n\n    # The bra vector <psi| is the conjugate transpose of |psi>.\n    # Since the elements are real, it's just the transpose.\n    psi_bra = psi.T\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the expectation value <P_z> = <psi|P_z|psi>\n    # Note: The result of matrix multiplication will be a 1x1 matrix, so we extract the scalar value.\n    exp_Pz = (psi_bra @ P_z @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the expectation value <P_z^2>\n    # First, find the matrix for P_z^2\n    P_z_squared = P_z @ P_z\n    # Then calculate <P_z^2> = <psi|P_z^2|psi>\n    exp_Pz_squared = (psi_bra @ P_z_squared @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the uncertainty (Delta P_z)^2 = <P_z^2> - <P_z>^2\n    # Remember our results are in units of hbar.\n    # So, <P_z> is actually exp_Pz * hbar\n    # And <P_z^2> is actually exp_Pz_squared * hbar^2\n    # (Delta P_z)^2 = (exp_Pz_squared * hbar^2) - (exp_Pz * hbar)^2\n    # (Delta P_z)^2 = (exp_Pz_squared - exp_Pz**2) * hbar^2\n    variance_Pz = exp_Pz_squared - exp_Pz**2\n    \n    # Delta P_z = sqrt(variance) * hbar\n    uncertainty_Pz_coeff = np.sqrt(variance_Pz)\n\n    # Step 4: Compare with the options\n    # A) hbar / sqrt(2)  -> coefficient is 1/sqrt(2)\n    # B) hbar              -> coefficient is 1\n    # C) hbar / 2           -> coefficient is 1/2\n    # D) sqrt(2) * hbar   -> coefficient is sqrt(2)\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': 1/np.sqrt(2),\n        'B': 1.0,\n        'C': 0.5,\n        'D': np.sqrt(2)\n    }\n\n    print(f\"The state vector |psi> is:\\n{psi}\\n\")\n    print(f\"The operator P_z (with hbar=1) is:\\n{P_z}\\n\")\n    print(f\"The expectation value <P_z> (in units of hbar) is: {exp_Pz:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"The expectation value <P_z^2> (in units of hbar^2) is: {exp_Pz_squared:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"The variance (Delta P_z)^2 (in units of hbar^2) is: {variance_Pz:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"The uncertainty Delta P_z (in units of hbar) is: sqrt({variance_Pz:.4f}) = {uncertainty_Pz_coeff:.4f}\\n\")\n    \n    for choice, value in options.items():\n        # Using np.isclose for robust floating-point comparison\n        if np.isclose(uncertainty_Pz_coeff, value):\n            print(f\"The calculated coefficient {uncertainty_Pz_coeff:.4f} matches the coefficient for option {choice} ({value:.4f}).\")\n            print(f\"Therefore, the uncertainty Delta P_z is hbar/sqrt(2).\")\n            print(f\"The correct option is {choice}.\")\n            # The final required output format\n            print(f'<<<{choice}>>>')\n            return\n\nsolve_uncertainty()\n```"
