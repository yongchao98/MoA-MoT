    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Model Particle Decay:** The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after a time `t_lab` in the detector's reference frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n    where `τ_lab` is the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab.\n\n2.  **Incorporate Relativity:** Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than its proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame). The relationship is:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate Travel Time:** The time it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall of radius `R` is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\n4.  **Combine Equations:** Substituting these into the decay law, we get:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n    The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for a given particle type and detector size.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Unknown:**\n    *   First, we use the initial data (`γ₁ = 20`, `N/N₀ = 1/3`) to find this constant. Rearranging the formula gives: `ln(N/N₀) = -R / (γ * c * τ)`.\n    *   Then, we use this constant and the desired new fraction (`N/N₀ = 2/3`) to solve for the required new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the required Lorentz factor.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_lorentz_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the required Lorentz factor for a given particle survival fraction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Scenario 1: Given data\n    gamma1 = 20.0\n    frac1 = 1.0 / 3.0\n\n    # Scenario 2: Desired outcome\n    frac2 = 2.0 / 3.0\n\n    # The survival fraction formula is frac = exp(-k / gamma), where k is a constant\n    # representing R / (c * tau).\n    # From the formula, we can write k = -gamma * ln(frac).\n    \n    # Step 1: Use Scenario 1 to find the constant 'k'.\n    # k = -gamma1 * ln(frac1) = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)\n    constant_k = -gamma1 * math.log(frac1)\n\n    # Step 2: Use the constant 'k' and Scenario 2 to find the new gamma (gamma2).\n    # frac2 = exp(-k / gamma2)  =>  ln(frac2) = -k / gamma2  =>  gamma2 = -k / ln(frac2)\n    gamma2 = -constant_k / math.log(frac2)\n    \n    print(\"This problem is solved using the principles of special relativity and particle decay.\")\n    print(\"The survival probability of a particle is related to its Lorentz factor (γ).\")\n    print(\"\\nInitial conditions:\")\n    print(f\"  - Lorentz factor (γ₁): {gamma1}\")\n    print(f\"  - Survival fraction: {frac1:.3f} (1/3)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nDesired conditions:\")\n    print(f\"  - Desired survival fraction: {frac2:.3f} (2/3)\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated Lorentz factor (γ₂) required to achieve this is: {gamma2:.2f}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nComparing this result with the given choices:\")\n    print(\"A) 54\")\n    print(\"B) 68\")\n    print(\"C) 40\")\n    print(\"D) 28\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option A.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution\nsolve_lorentz_factor()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
