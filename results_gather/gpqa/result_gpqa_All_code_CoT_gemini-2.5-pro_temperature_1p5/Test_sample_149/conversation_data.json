    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula is C8H9NO. The DBE is calculated as `C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5`. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE).\n    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   `9.72 ppm (t, 1H)`: This is the chemical shift for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting is a triplet (t), which means it's coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-). This confirms the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n        *   `6.98 ppm (d, 2H)` and `6.51 ppm (d, 2H)`: These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   `6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for 2 protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2).\n        *   `3.66 ppm (d, 2H)`: A doublet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. It's split into a doublet by the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The fragments are a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group. Assembling these gives **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 (amine) = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. This matches perfectly.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n    *   **Step 1 & 2: `1. NaNO2 + HCl` followed by `2. H2O`**: This is a standard two-step process for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine followed by hydrolysis. The aromatic amine group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is then replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) upon warming with water. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n        *   Intermediate Product: The -NH2 group on 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde is converted to an -OH group, yielding **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Step 3: `aq. KOH, Heat`**: This step involves reacting the intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde, with a base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** One molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde forms an enolate (by the base removing an α-hydrogen). This enolate then attacks the aldehyde carbonyl of a second molecule. This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this addition product would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (which corresponds to option D).\n        *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. Heat provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the β-hydroxy aldehyde. This dehydration is highly favorable as it results in a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is more stable. The hydroxyl group at the β-position (C3) and a hydrogen from the α-position (C2) are eliminated.\n        *   **Final Product:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal leads to the formation of a double bond between C2 and C3, resulting in **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This structure matches option B.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**\n    The question asks for the *final product*. Given the condition \"Heat\", the reaction will proceed to the more stable condensation product rather than stopping at the addition product. Therefore, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the final product.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the starting material from the provided molecular formula and NMR data.\n# Molecular Formula: C8H9NO\n# NMR Data:\n# 9.72 (t, 1H): Aldehyde proton (-CHO) next to a CH2.\n# 6.98 (d, 2H) & 6.51 (d, 2H): Para-substituted benzene ring.\n# 6.27 (bs, 2H): Primary amine (-NH2).\n# 3.66 (d, 2H): CH2 group next to the aldehyde.\n# Conclusion for Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.\n# Reaction 1 & 2: NaNO2/HCl followed by H2O converts a primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) into a phenol (Ar-OH).\n# So, 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde becomes 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n# Reaction 3: aq.
