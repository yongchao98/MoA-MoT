Synthesis of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\n*   **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1.** The reaction of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction). This replaces an α-hydrogen with a bromine atom.\n    *   Product 1 is **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2.** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted to an ethyl ester.\n    *   Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3.** The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4.** The reaction of ethyl cyanoacetate with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane is a tandem alkylation-cyclization.\n    1.  NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon (the CH₂ between the -CN and -COOEt groups).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    3.  The excess NaH deprotonates the α-carbon again.\n    4.  The new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   Product 4 is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**2. ¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1). To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This creates a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Chemical Equivalence:** Protons that can be interchanged by this plane of symmetry are chemically equivalent. Protons that are not interchangeable are distinct. We must also consider diastereotopicity.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial in a given snapshot) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The same is true for C6. Due to the symmetry plane, the two axial protons (at C2 and C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals** for the four protons at these positions.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, the axial and equatorial protons are distinct. The two axial protons (at C3 and C5) are equivalent, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent. This gives **2 signals** for the four protons at these positions.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons attached to it (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are not interchangeable. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n**3. Total Number of Signals**\n\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring:\nTotal Signals = 2 (from ethyl group) + 6 (from ring) = **8**\n\nTherefore, there are 8 chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n1.  **Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) + Br₂/Pyridine/Acetic Anhydride → Product 1:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction). The product is **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n\n2.  **Product 1 + Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) / H₂SO₄ → Product 2:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted to an ester. The product is **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n3.  **Product 2 + Sodium Cyanide (NaCN) → Product 3:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion displaces the bromide. The product is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess Sodium Hydride (NaH) + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction.\n    *   NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon (the CH₂ between the -CN and -COOEt groups).\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   The excess NaH deprotonates the α-carbon again.\n    *   The new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   The final product (4) is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe key to this problem is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry at room temperature, the standard condition for NMR unless otherwise specified.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, the two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:** We must count the sets of protons that are not interchangeable by this symmetry operation or by rapid bond rotation.\n\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the molecule's plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The plane of symmetry makes the carbons (and their protons) on one side of the ring equivalent to those on the other (C2 is equivalent to C6; C3 is equivalent to C5).\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two protons on any single carbon of the ring (e.g., C2) are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral environment and are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. The axial and equatorial protons are distinct. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent, the two axial protons (at C2 and C6) form one set, and the two equatorial protons form another. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give **2 signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n        *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   *Total from the ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n*   **Total Number of Distinct Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring: 2 + 6 = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\nThis analysis is the most rigorous for a standard room-temperature NMR spectrum and is a common topic in university-level organic chemistry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe reaction sequence is as follows:\n*   **Step 1:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) undergoes an alpha-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction) to form **Product 1: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n*   **Step 2:** Bromoacetic acid undergoes Fischer esterification with ethanol to form **Product 2: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Step 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate undergoes an Sₙ2 reaction with sodium cyanide (NaCN) to form **Product 3: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Step 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated twice by excess sodium hydride (NaH) and undergoes a tandem alkylation-cyclization with 1,5-dibromopentane. This forms a six-membered ring. The final product is **Product 4: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify this reaction sequence and the final product.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This creates a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the C1 and C4 carbons of the ring, as well as the two substituents on C1.\n*   **Counting Distinct Protons:** We count the sets of protons that are not interchangeable by this symmetry plane or by rapid rotation.\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** In any given chair conformation, the axial and equatorial protons on C2 are in different environments (they are diastereotopic). The same is true for C6. Because of the symmetry plane, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The two axial protons are equivalent, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent. This gives another **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two attached protons (one axial, one equatorial in a chair form) are diastereotopic. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are not interchangeable. Therefore, they give **2 distinct signals**.\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 + 1 = 2 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 6 signals\n    *   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 signals.**\n\nThis analysis is the most common and pedagogically sound approach for this type of molecule, balancing the concepts of time-averaged symmetry and diastereotopicity. It is also the conclusion reached by the majority of the provided candidate answers.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. The final product is Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n# 2.

This is an α-bromination reaction (a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction). The product is bromoacetic acid.\n    *   **Product 1:** BrCH₂COOH\n\n2.  **Reaction 2:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).

This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n4.  **Reaction 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n    *   NaH is a strong base that removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon (the CH₂ group between the -CN and -COOEt groups).\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   Because excess NaH is used, the second α-proton is also removed, forming a new carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** The final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product.**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1). To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Symmetry and Conformation:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group.\n\n*   **Counting Distinct Proton Environments:** We need to count the sets of protons that are not interchangeable by this symmetry plane or by rapid rotation. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires us to consider diastereotopicity.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation.

C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial in any given chair conformation) are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The same is true for C6. Since the plane of symmetry makes C2 and C6 equivalent, the two axial protons (H₂ₐₓ and H₆ₐₓ) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons (H₂ₑq and H₆ₑq) are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** for the four protons at these positions.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** By the same logic, the four protons on these two carbons are divided into two sets (axial and equatorial), giving **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C4 (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are not interchangeable.

Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. To find the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry and identify all chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, the two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4.\n*   **Counting Distinct Proton Environments:** Protons that can be interchanged by this symmetry operation are chemically equivalent.

They are not interchangeable by symmetry. The same is true for C6. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent positions, the two axial protons (at C2 and C6) form one set, and the two equatorial protons form another. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, the positions C3 and C5 are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons on these carbons are diastereotopic. This gives another **2 signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** Carbon C4 lies on the plane of symmetry.

The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane. The use of excess base ensures the removal of the second α-proton, and the resulting carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, closing a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the final product. The core of the problem is the analysis of its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹H NMR Analysis of Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires careful consideration of stereochemistry and conformational dynamics.\n\nThere are two primary models for analyzing the NMR of this molecule:\n\n*   **Model A: Locked Conformation (Low Temperature or Rigorous \"Distinct Proton\" Counting)**\n    The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different, making the molecule chiral. It lacks any plane of symmetry. In a single, fixed chair conformation, all ten protons on the cyclohexane ring are in chemically distinct environments (5 axial, 5 equatorial, none equivalent by symmetry). The ethyl group would have 2 or 3 signals (the -OCH₂- protons are diastereotopic). This would lead to 10 (ring) + 2 (ethyl, simplified) = 12 signals, or 13 signals (rigorously). This matches option C (12).\n\n*   **Model B: Rapid Flipping Conformation (Room Temperature)**\n    At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This creates a *time-averaged* plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, and the two substituents. This is the standard assumption for analyzing NMR spectra unless low temperature is specified.\n    Let's count the signals based on this model:\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the time-averaged plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5. C4 is unique.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic. Because C2 and C6 are equivalent, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **2 distinct signals** for the four protons at these positions.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons at these positions give **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic and are not interchanged by the symmetry plane. They are in different chemical environments (one is *cis* to the cyano group, the other is *cis* to the ester, on average). This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n\n    **Total Signal Count (Model B):**\n    *   From ethyl group: 1 + 1 = 2 signals\n    *   From cyclohexane ring: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals\n    *   **Total = 8 signals**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis based on the standard room-temperature, rapidly-flipping model (Model B) yields 8 distinct signals. This is a chemically sound and standard interpretation. The analysis based on a locked, asymmetric conformation (Model A) yields 12 signals. Given that \"observable\" signals are requested, the room-temperature model is the most appropriate. The reasoning laid out in several of the candidate answers (e.g., 1, 5, 7, 13) correctly leads to 8 signals, even if some of them selected the wrong final option. The consensus of sound chemical reasoning points to 8.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis proceeds through four sequential reactions. All candidate answers correctly identify the reaction sequence and the final product.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid):** The first step is an alpha-bromination of acetic acid, a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) type reaction, which yields bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate):** The second step is a Fischer esterification of bromoacetic acid with ethanol, yielding ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate):** The third step is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) where sodium cyanide replaces the bromine atom, yielding ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate):** The final step is a tandem reaction. The acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated by the strong base sodium hydride (NaH). The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. Since excess NaH is used, the α-carbon is deprotonated again, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the other end of the pentane chain. This cyclization forms a stable six-membered ring.\n\nThe final product, **Product 4**, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry and Chemical Equivalence:** The key to solving this problem is choosing the correct model for analyzing the symmetry of a 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane. There are several levels of analysis, but the most common and logical for a problem of this type is as follows:\n    *   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This creates a time-averaged \"effective\" plane of symmetry that passes through C1, the two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4.\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes the two sides of the ring equivalent. Therefore, carbon C2 is equivalent to C6, and carbon C3 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens. In a substituted ring, geminal protons (the two protons on the same CH₂ group) are often diastereotopic, meaning they are in different chemical environments and give separate signals.\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** These positions are equivalent due to the symmetry plane. However, on any single one of these carbons, the axial and equatorial protons are in different chemical environments (they are diastereotopic). Therefore, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. These positions are equivalent. The axial protons are equivalent to each other, and the equatorial protons are equivalent to each other, but the axial and equatorial protons are distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (axial and equatorial) are in different environments relative to the substituents on C1. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   *Total from the ring = 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 6 signals.*\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    Summing the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring:\n    Total Signals = 2 (from ethyl group) + 6 (from ring) = **8**\n\nThis analysis is the most consistent and commonly applied model for this type of molecule in an academic setting, and it leads directly to one of the provided answers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe reaction sequence described is a standard multi-step organic synthesis.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride → Product 1:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H₂SO₄ → Product 2:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid group of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is a tandem deprotonation-alkylation-cyclization reaction.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes an acidic proton from the carbon between the cyano and ester groups.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures that the second acidic proton on the same carbon is also removed.\n    *   The new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry and the chemical equivalence of its protons. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires careful consideration of stereochemistry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This symmetry plane dictates which protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6.\n    *   It also makes the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   The protons on C4 are unique and lie on the symmetry plane.\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are related by the molecule's plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR experiment, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** These positions are equivalent due to the symmetry plane. However, on any single carbon (like C2), the two attached protons (one axial and one equatorial in a given chair conformation) are not interchangeable by symmetry. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. Therefore, the two axial protons (at C2 and C6) form one set, and the two equatorial protons (at C2 and C6) form another. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** These positions are also equivalent. By the same logic as C2/C6, the four protons on these two carbons give **2 signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n        *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the symmetry plane. The two protons attached to it are diastereotopic because replacing one versus the other with a different group would create diastereomers. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    Summing the signals from both parts of the molecule:\n    Total Signals = 2 (from ethyl group) + 6 (from cyclohexane ring) = **8**\n\nTherefore, there are 8 chemically distinct hydrogen signals observable in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis proceeds through four well-defined steps:\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride → Product 1:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction).\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H₂SO₄ → Product 2:** This is a Fischer esterification.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) where cyanide displaces bromide.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is a tandem reaction.\n    *   First, NaH (a strong base) deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   The excess NaH deprotonates the α-carbon again.\n    *   The new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, closing a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Structure of Product 4 for ¹H NMR Spectroscopy**\n\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. The key is to count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n*   **Model for Analysis:** The most appropriate model for analyzing such a molecule at room temperature (unless otherwise specified) is to consider the time-averaged conformation due to rapid chair-flipping. This creates an effective plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, and the two substituents.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments based on this model:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂-:** The two protons of the methylene group are related by the molecule's plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent. It also makes C3 and C5 equivalent. C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** While the C2 and C6 positions are equivalent, the two protons on any single one of these carbons (one axial, one equatorial in a given conformation) are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic. Therefore, the two axial protons (at C2 and C6) form one set, and the two equatorial protons form another. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give **2 signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic because replacing one versus the other leads to different diastereomers. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Signals**\n\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring:\nTotal Signals = (Signals from ethyl group) + (Signals from ring)\nTotal Signals = 2 + 6 = **8**\n\nThis analysis, which balances the concepts of conformational averaging and diastereotopicity, is the standard approach for such problems and is the most chemically sound interpretation that leads to one of the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Determine the Final Product Structure**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the four-step reaction sequence and the final product.\n*   **Step 1: Alpha-bromination.** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is converted to bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH). This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) type reaction.\n*   **Step 2: Fischer Esterification.** Bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) to form ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Step 3: Nucleophilic Substitution (Sₙ2).** Ethyl bromoacetate reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) to form ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Step 4: Tandem Alkylation and Cyclization.** Ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated by the strong base sodium hydride (NaH). The resulting carbanion attacks 1,5-dibromopentane. The use of excess NaH ensures a second deprotonation, followed by an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction to form a stable six-membered ring.\n\nThe final product, **Product 4**, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Structure for ¹H NMR Spectroscopy**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon, C1.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to choose the correct model for analyzing the molecule's symmetry and the resulting chemical equivalence of its protons.\n\n*   **Model 1: Oversimplified Model (Leads to 5 signals)**\n    This model assumes rapid chair-flipping, creating a plane of symmetry. It then incorrectly simplifies by treating all protons on symmetrically equivalent carbons (e.g., C2 and C6) as a single group. This gives 3 signals for the ring and 2 for the ethyl group, totaling 5. This is a common simplification in introductory courses but is not rigorous enough for a question asking for *chemically distinct* hydrogens.\n\n*   **Model 2: Locked Conformation Model (Leads to 12 or 13 signals)**\n    This model assumes the bulky groups on C1 prevent ring-flipping, locking the molecule into a single, asymmetric chair conformation. In this case, all 10 ring protons would be distinct. The ethyl group would add 2 or 3 more signals. This leads to 12 or 13 signals, but the assumption of a completely locked conformation and the inconsistent simplification of the ethyl group make this model less likely to be the intended one.\n\n*   **Model 3: Rigorous Rapid-Flipping Model (Leads to 8 signals)**\n    This is the most chemically accurate model for this molecule at room temperature.\n    1.  **Symmetry:** The rapid interconversion between chair forms creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n    2.  **Consequences of Symmetry:** This plane makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    3.  **Counting the Signals:**\n        *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n            *   The three -CH₃ protons are equivalent by rotation. **(1 signal)**\n            *   The two -OCH₂- protons are related by the plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n        *   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n            *   **C2/C6 Protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic (not interchangeable by symmetry). The same is true for C6. The plane of symmetry makes the two axial protons (on C2 and C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n            *   **C3/C5 Protons:** The same logic applies. The two axial protons are one set, and the two equatorial protons are another. This gives **2 signals**.\n            *   **C4 Protons:** The two protons on C4 lie on the plane of symmetry but are diastereotopic relative to the rest of the molecule. They are in different chemical environments (one is cis to the ester, the other is trans, in a planar projection). They are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n    **Total Count:** 1 (CH₃) + 1 (OCH₂) + 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe most accurate and consistent chemical reasoning leads to the conclusion that there are 8 distinct hydrogen signals. This result matches option A. The majority of the provided candidate answers, despite some flaws in their reasoning or final letter choices, also converge on the number 8.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction sequence is a standard multi-step organic synthesis.\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction). This replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (`BrCH₂COOH`)\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid is a Fischer esterification.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (`BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃`)\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2), where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (`NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃`)\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** The reaction of ethyl cyanoacetate with excess sodium hydride (a strong base) and 1,5-dibromopentane is a tandem alkylation-cyclization. The acidic α-carbon is deprotonated twice, reacting first with one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane and then intramolecularly with the other end to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This depends on the molecule's symmetry and conformational dynamics.\n\n*   **Symmetry and Conformation:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through C1 (the carbon with the substituents), C4 (the opposite carbon), the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group.\n\n*   **Counting Distinct Proton Environments:** We must count the sets of protons that are not interchangeable by this symmetry plane or by rapid bond rotation. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires us to consider diastereotopicity.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (`-CH₃`) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (`-OCH₂-`) are rendered enantiotopic by the molecular plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5. C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** In any given chair conformation, the two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial) are in different environments. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The same is true for C6. Because of the symmetry plane, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** for the four protons at these positions.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The situation is identical to C2/C6. The four protons on these two carbons also give **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. They are diastereotopic and therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Signals**\n\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring:\nTotal Signals = 2 (from ethyl group) + 6 (from ring) = **8**\n\nThis analysis, which assumes rapid chair-flipping at room temperature and correctly identifies diastereotopic protons within the resulting time-averaged symmetric structure, is the standard and most accurate interpretation for this type of molecule. It leads to a total of 8 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\n*   **Step 1:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with Br₂, pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is an α-bromination reaction (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky variant).\n    *   Product 1: **Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n*   **Step 2:** Product 1 is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and H₂SO₄. This is a Fischer esterification.\n    *   Product 2: **Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Step 3:** Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). This is an Sₙ2 reaction where cyanide displaces bromide.\n    *   Product 3: **Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Step 4:** Product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization.\n    *   NaH deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   Excess NaH deprotonates the α-carbon again.\n    *   The new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction on the other end of the pentane chain, forming a 6-membered ring.\n    *   Product 4: **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify this final product. The discrepancy lies in the ¹H NMR analysis.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the final product. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The final product has a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry. C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral. In a chiral molecule, any protons not related by simple bond rotation are chemically non-equivalent (diastereotopic).\n\n*   **Conformation:** The cyclohexane ring has two bulky substituents on C1. This will create a high energy barrier for chair-flipping, and the molecule will exist almost exclusively in the conformation where the larger ethoxycarbonyl group is in the equatorial position. For the purpose of counting distinct protons, we should analyze this single, stable (\"locked\") conformation.\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Protons:**\n    1.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** Since the molecule is chiral and exists in a locked conformation, there is no symmetry to make any of the ring protons equivalent.\n        *   The five methylene groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all in unique chemical environments.\n        *   Within each methylene group, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n        *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct.\n        *   **Ring signals = 10**.\n\n    2.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃) Protons:**\n        *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **Methylene Protons (-OCH₂-):** These two protons are part of a side chain in a chiral molecule. This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent and should, in principle, give two separate signals.\n        *   **Rigorous Count:** 10 (ring) + 2 (-OCH₂-) + 1 (-CH₃) = 13 signals. This is not an option.\n\n*   **Applying a Common Simplification:** In many textbook problems, diastereotopic protons in a flexible acyclic side chain (like the -OCH₂- here) are often simplified and treated as a single signal, as their chemical shift difference can be small. Let's apply this common simplification.\n    *   **Simplified Count:** 10 (ring) + 1 (-OCH₂-) + 1 (-CH₃) = **12 signals**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** This result (12) matches option A. This line of reasoning is the most rigorous one that leads to one of the given answers. It correctly identifies the lack of symmetry in the molecule and only applies a single, very common simplification regarding the side chain. The hint in the question, \"some of them maybe very close in chemical shift,\" strongly supports this detailed analysis, which predicts many distinct signals (10 from the ring alone). The alternative models that yield 5 or 8 signals rely on assuming a plane of symmetry that does not exist, which is a less accurate approach.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction). This replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** Product 1 is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** Product 3 is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n    *   First, NaH, a strong base, removes one of the acidic protons from the carbon atom situated between the two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt).\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule, displacing a bromide ion.\n    *   Since excess NaH is used, the second acidic proton on the same carbon is also removed.\n    *   This new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to displace the second bromide ion. This cyclization forms a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must identify all chemically non-equivalent protons. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires careful consideration of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule has a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1). At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, and the two substituents.\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Proton Environments:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the molecule's time-averaged plane of symmetry. This makes them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** In any given chair conformation, the two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial) are in different environments. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The same is true for C6. Because the C2 and C6 positions are equivalent due to the symmetry plane, the two axial protons (at C2 and C6) form one set, and the two equatorial protons form another. This results in **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons at these two positions give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n        *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are not interchangeable by this symmetry operation. They are diastereotopic and therefore chemically distinct. This results in **2 distinct signals**.\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (-CH₃) + 1 (-OCH₂-) = 2 signals.\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals.\n    *   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThis analysis, which considers time-averaged symmetry while correctly identifying diastereotopic protons as distinct, is the standard approach for this type of molecule and leads to one of the given options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Final Product's Structure**\n\nThe reaction sequence described is a standard multi-step synthesis in organic chemistry.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride → Product 1:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction). The product is **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol + H₂SO₄ → Product 2:** This is a Fischer esterification. The product is **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) where cyanide displaces bromide. The product is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is a tandem alkylation/cyclization.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   The excess NaH removes the second α-proton, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, closing a six-membered ring.\n    *   The final product, **Product 4**, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify this reaction sequence and the final product. The core of the problem lies in the ¹H NMR analysis of this final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**\n\nThe question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogen signals. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the chemical environment of each proton.\n\nThe structure is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon, C1.\n\nThere are two main approaches to analyzing the NMR spectrum of such a molecule, and the correct choice depends on the assumptions made about its conformation and the level of detail required.\n\n**Analysis based on a Time-Averaged Conformation (Rapid Ring Flipping):**\n\nAt room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This creates a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two protons on C2 (one axial and one equatorial in any given snapshot) are diastereotopic. They are in different chemical environments and are not interchangeable by the symmetry operation. Therefore, the two axial protons (on C2 and C6) form one set, and the two equatorial protons form another. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The axial protons are one set, and the equatorial protons are another. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic because replacing one versus the other with a different atom would create diastereomers. They are in different chemical environments. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Signal Count:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 + 1 = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThis analysis is the most rigorous for a molecule undergoing rapid conformational averaging at room temperature and directly addresses the concept of \"chemically distinct\" protons, including diastereotopicity. Several of the provided answers (e.g., 5, 7, 13) correctly use this model to arrive at 8 signals.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe synthesis yields ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. A careful analysis of this molecule's symmetry and the chemical equivalence of its protons reveals 8 distinct sets of hydrogens. This corresponds to option A. Other answers, such as 5 or 12, arise from either oversimplifying the structure (ignoring diastereotopicity) or assuming a non-physical \"locked\" conformation with arbitrary simplifications. The most chemically sound interpretation leads to 8 signals.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Final Product's Structure**\n\nThe reaction sequence described is a standard multi-step organic synthesis. All candidate answers correctly identify the progression:\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Bromoacetic acid:** The first step is an α-bromination of acetic acid, a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) type reaction, yielding bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n2.  **Bromoacetic acid → Ethyl bromoacetate:** The second step is a Fischer esterification with ethanol, yielding ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  **Ethyl bromoacetate → Ethyl cyanoacetate:** The third step is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) with sodium cyanide, yielding ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n4.  **Ethyl cyanoacetate → Final Product 4:** The final step involves a double alkylation using excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. The acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated twice in sequence, first performing an intermolecular alkylation and then an intramolecular cyclization to form a stable six-membered ring.\n\nThe final product (4) is correctly identified by all agents as **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This symmetry dictates which protons are chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton signals based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the molecule's plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** In any given chair conformation, the two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial) are in different spatial environments. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The same is true for C6. Because the C2 and C6 positions are equivalent due to the symmetry plane, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) form one set, and the two equatorial protons form another. This results in **2 signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two attached protons (one axial, one equatorial) are not interchangeable by this symmetry. They are diastereotopic because replacing one versus the other with a different atom would create diastereomers. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. This results in **2 signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Signals**\n\nBy summing the signals from all parts of the molecule, we get:\nTotal Signals = (Signals from ethyl group) + (Signals from cyclohexane ring)\nTotal Signals = 2 + 6 = **8**\n\nThis analysis, which accounts for both the time-averaged symmetry of the flipping ring and the diastereotopicity of geminal protons, is the standard and most chemically accurate approach for this type of problem. It is also the conclusion reached by the majority of the provided candidate answers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe reaction sequence is as follows:\n*   **Step 1:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) undergoes an alpha-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction) to form **Product 1: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n*   **Step 2:** Bromoacetic acid undergoes Fischer esterification with ethanol to form **Product 2: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Step 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate undergoes an Sₙ2 reaction with sodium cyanide (NaCN) to form **Product 3: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Step 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated twice by excess sodium hydride (NaH) and undergoes a tandem alkylation-cyclization with 1,5-dibromopentane. This forms a six-membered ring. The final product is **Product 4: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify this reaction sequence and the final product.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This creates a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the C1 and C4 carbons of the ring, as well as the two substituents on C1.\n*   **Counting Distinct Protons:** We count the sets of protons that are not interchangeable by this symmetry plane or by rapid rotation.\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** In any given chair conformation, the axial and equatorial protons on C2 are in different environments (they are diastereotopic). The same is true for C6. Because of the symmetry plane, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The two axial protons are equivalent, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent. This gives another **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two attached protons (one axial, one equatorial in a chair form) are diastereotopic. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are not interchangeable. Therefore, they give **2 distinct signals**.\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 + 1 = 2 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 6 signals\n    *   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 signals.**\n\nThis analysis is the most common and pedagogically sound approach for this type of molecule, balancing the concepts of time-averaged symmetry and diastereotopicity.

They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The same is true for C6. Since the plane of symmetry makes C2 and C6 equivalent, the two axial protons (H₂ₐₓ and H₆ₐₓ) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons (H₂ₑq and H₆ₑq) are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** for the four protons at these positions.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** By the same logic, the four protons on these two carbons are divided into two sets (axial and equatorial), giving **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry.

They are not interchangeable by symmetry. The same is true for C6. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent positions, the two axial protons (at C2 and C6) form one set, and the two equatorial protons form another.

The core of the problem is the analysis of its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹H NMR Analysis of Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires careful consideration of stereochemistry and conformational dynamics.\n\nThere are two primary models for analyzing the NMR of this molecule:\n\n*   **Model A: Locked Conformation (Low Temperature or Rigorous \"Distinct Proton\" Counting)**\n    The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different, making the molecule chiral. It lacks any plane of symmetry. In a single, fixed chair conformation, all ten protons on the cyclohexane ring are in chemically distinct environments (5 axial, 5 equatorial, none equivalent by symmetry). The ethyl group would have 2 or 3 signals (the -OCH₂- protons are diastereotopic). This would lead to 10 (ring) + 2 (ethyl, simplified) = 12 signals, or 13 signals (rigorously). This matches option C (12).\n\n*   **Model B: Rapid Flipping Conformation (Room Temperature)**\n    At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This creates a *time-averaged* plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, and the two substituents. This is the standard assumption for analyzing NMR spectra unless low temperature is specified.\n    Let's count the signals based on this model:\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the time-averaged plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5. C4 is unique.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic. Because C2 and C6 are equivalent, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **2 distinct signals** for the four protons at these positions.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons at these positions give **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic and are not interchanged by the symmetry plane. They are in different chemical environments (one is *cis* to the cyano group, the other is *cis* to the ester, on average). This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n\n    **Total Signal Count (Model B):**\n    *   From ethyl group: 1 + 1 = 2 signals\n    *   From cyclohexane ring: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals\n    *   **Total = 8 signals**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis based on the standard room-temperature, rapidly-flipping model (Model B) yields 8 distinct signals. This is a chemically sound and standard interpretation. The analysis based on a locked, asymmetric conformation (Model A) yields 12 signals. Given that \"observable\" signals are requested, the room-temperature model is the most appropriate. The reasoning laid out in several of the candidate answers (e.g., 1, 5, 7, 13) correctly leads to 8 signals, even if some of them selected the wrong final option. The consensus of sound chemical reasoning points to 8.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis proceeds through four sequential reactions. All candidate answers correctly identify the reaction sequence and the final product.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid):** The first step is an alpha-bromination of acetic acid, a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) type reaction, which yields bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate):** The second step is a Fischer esterification of bromoacetic acid with ethanol, yielding ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate):** The third step is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) where sodium cyanide replaces the bromine atom, yielding ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate):** The final step is a tandem reaction. The acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated by the strong base sodium hydride (NaH). The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. Since excess NaH is used, the α-carbon is deprotonated again, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the other end of the pentane chain. This cyclization forms a stable six-membered ring.\n\nThe final product, **Product 4**, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry and Chemical Equivalence:** The key to solving this problem is choosing the correct model for analyzing the symmetry of a 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane. There are several levels of analysis, but the most common and logical for a problem of this type is as follows:\n    *   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This creates a time-averaged \"effective\" plane of symmetry that passes through C1, the two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4.\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes the two sides of the ring equivalent. Therefore, carbon C2 is equivalent to C6, and carbon C3 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens. In a substituted ring, geminal protons (the two protons on the same CH₂ group) are often diastereotopic, meaning they are in different chemical environments and give separate signals.\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** These positions are equivalent due to the symmetry plane. However, on any single one of these carbons, the axial and equatorial protons are in different chemical environments (they are diastereotopic). Therefore, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. These positions are equivalent. The axial protons are equivalent to each other, and the equatorial protons are equivalent to each other, but the axial and equatorial protons are distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (axial and equatorial) are in different environments relative to the substituents on C1. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   *Total from the ring = 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 6 signals.*\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    Summing the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring:\n    Total Signals = 2 (from ethyl group) + 6 (from ring) = **8**\n\nThis analysis is the most consistent and commonly applied model for this type of molecule in an academic setting, and it leads directly to one of the provided answers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe reaction sequence described is a standard multi-step organic synthesis.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride → Product 1:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.

The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires careful consideration of stereochemistry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This symmetry plane dictates which protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6.\n    *   It also makes the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   The protons on C4 are unique and lie on the symmetry plane.\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are related by the molecule's plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR experiment, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** These positions are equivalent due to the symmetry plane. However, on any single carbon (like C2), the two attached protons (one axial and one equatorial in a given chair conformation) are not interchangeable by symmetry. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. Therefore, the two axial protons (at C2 and C6) form one set, and the two equatorial protons (at C2 and C6) form another. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** These positions are also equivalent. By the same logic as C2/C6, the four protons on these two carbons give **2 signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n        *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the symmetry plane. The two protons attached to it are diastereotopic because replacing one versus the other with a different group would create diastereomers. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    Summing the signals from both parts of the molecule:\n    Total Signals = 2 (from ethyl group) + 6 (from cyclohexane ring) = **8**\n\nTherefore, there are 8 chemically distinct hydrogen signals observable in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis proceeds through four well-defined steps:\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride → Product 1:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction).\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H₂SO₄ → Product 2:** This is a Fischer esterification.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) where cyanide displaces bromide.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is a tandem reaction.\n    *   First, NaH (a strong base) deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   The excess NaH deprotonates the α-carbon again.\n    *   The new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, closing a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Structure of Product 4 for ¹H NMR Spectroscopy**\n\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. The key is to count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n*   **Model for Analysis:** The most appropriate model for analyzing such a molecule at room temperature (unless otherwise specified) is to consider the time-averaged conformation due to rapid chair-flipping. This creates an effective plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, and the two substituents.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments based on this model:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂-:** The two protons of the methylene group are related by the molecule's plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent. It also makes C3 and C5 equivalent. C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** While the C2 and C6 positions are equivalent, the two protons on any single one of these carbons (one axial, one equatorial in a given conformation) are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic. Therefore, the two axial protons (at C2 and C6) form one set, and the two equatorial protons form another. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give **2 signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic because replacing one versus the other leads to different diastereomers. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Signals**\n\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring:\nTotal Signals = (Signals from ethyl group) + (Signals from ring)\nTotal Signals = 2 + 6 = **8**\n\nThis analysis, which balances the concepts of conformational averaging and diastereotopicity, is the standard approach for such problems and is the most chemically sound interpretation that leads to one of the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Determine the Final Product Structure**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the four-step reaction sequence and the final product.\n*   **Step 1: Alpha-bromination.** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is converted to bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH). This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) type reaction.\n*   **Step 2: Fischer Esterification.** Bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) to form ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Step 3: Nucleophilic Substitution (Sₙ2).** Ethyl bromoacetate reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) to form ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Step 4: Tandem Alkylation and Cyclization.** Ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated by the strong base sodium hydride (NaH). The resulting carbanion attacks 1,5-dibromopentane. The use of excess NaH ensures a second deprotonation, followed by an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction to form a stable six-membered ring.\n\nThe final product, **Product 4**, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Structure for ¹H NMR Spectroscopy**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon, C1.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to choose the correct model for analyzing the molecule's symmetry and the resulting chemical equivalence of its protons.\n\n*   **Model 1: Oversimplified Model (Leads to 5 signals)**\n    This model assumes rapid chair-flipping, creating a plane of symmetry. It then incorrectly simplifies by treating all protons on symmetrically equivalent carbons (e.g., C2 and C6) as a single group. This gives 3 signals for the ring and 2 for the ethyl group, totaling 5. This is a common simplification in introductory courses but is not rigorous enough for a question asking for *chemically distinct* hydrogens.\n\n*   **Model 2: Locked Conformation Model (Leads to 12 or 13 signals)**\n    This model assumes the bulky groups on C1 prevent ring-flipping, locking the molecule into a single, asymmetric chair conformation. In this case, all 10 ring protons would be distinct. The ethyl group would add 2 or 3 more signals. This leads to 12 or 13 signals, but the assumption of a completely locked conformation and the inconsistent simplification of the ethyl group make this model less likely to be the intended one.\n\n*   **Model 3: Rigorous Rapid-Flipping Model (Leads to 8 signals)**\n    This is the most chemically accurate model for this molecule at room temperature.\n    1.  **Symmetry:** The rapid interconversion between chair forms creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n    2.  **Consequences of Symmetry:** This plane makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    3.  **Counting the Signals:**\n        *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n            *   The three -CH₃ protons are equivalent by rotation. **(1 signal)**\n            *   The two -OCH₂- protons are related by the plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n        *   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n            *   **C2/C6 Protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic (not interchangeable by symmetry). The same is true for C6. The plane of symmetry makes the two axial protons (on C2 and C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n            *   **C3/C5 Protons:** The same logic applies. The two axial protons are one set, and the two equatorial protons are another. This gives **2 signals**.\n            *   **C4 Protons:** The two protons on C4 lie on the plane of symmetry but are diastereotopic relative to the rest of the molecule. They are in different chemical environments (one is cis to the ester, the other is trans, in a planar projection). They are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n    **Total Count:** 1 (CH₃) + 1 (OCH₂) + 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe most accurate and consistent chemical reasoning leads to the conclusion that there are 8 distinct hydrogen signals. This result matches option A. The majority of the provided candidate answers, despite some flaws in their reasoning or final letter choices, also converge on the number 8.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction sequence is a standard multi-step organic synthesis.\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction). This replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (`BrCH₂COOH`)\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid is a Fischer esterification.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (`BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃`)\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2), where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (`NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃`)\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** The reaction of ethyl cyanoacetate with excess sodium hydride (a strong base) and 1,5-dibromopentane is a tandem alkylation-cyclization. The acidic α-carbon is deprotonated twice, reacting first with one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane and then intramolecularly with the other end to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This depends on the molecule's symmetry and conformational dynamics.\n\n*   **Symmetry and Conformation:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through C1 (the carbon with the substituents), C4 (the opposite carbon), the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group.\n\n*   **Counting Distinct Proton Environments:** We must count the sets of protons that are not interchangeable by this symmetry plane or by rapid bond rotation. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires us to consider diastereotopicity.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (`-CH₃`) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (`-OCH₂-`) are rendered enantiotopic by the molecular plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5. C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** In any given chair conformation, the two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial) are in different environments. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The same is true for C6. Because of the symmetry plane, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** for the four protons at these positions.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The situation is identical to C2/C6. The four protons on these two carbons also give **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. They are diastereotopic and therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Signals**\n\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring:\nTotal Signals = 2 (from ethyl group) + 6 (from ring) = **8**\n\nThis analysis, which assumes rapid chair-flipping at room temperature and correctly identifies diastereotopic protons within the resulting time-averaged symmetric structure, is the standard and most accurate interpretation for this type of molecule. It leads to a total of 8 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\n*   **Step 1:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with Br₂, pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is an α-bromination reaction (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky variant).\n    *   Product 1: **Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n*   **Step 2:** Product 1 is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and H₂SO₄. This is a Fischer esterification.\n    *   Product 2: **Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Step 3:** Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). This is an Sₙ2 reaction where cyanide displaces bromide.\n    *   Product 3: **Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Step 4:** Product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization.\n    *   NaH deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   Excess NaH deprotonates the α-carbon again.\n    *   The new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction on the other end of the pentane chain, forming a 6-membered ring.\n    *   Product 4: **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify this final product. The discrepancy lies in the ¹H NMR analysis.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the final product. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The final product has a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry. C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral. In a chiral molecule, any protons not related by simple bond rotation are chemically non-equivalent (diastereotopic).\n\n*   **Conformation:** The cyclohexane ring has two bulky substituents on C1. This will create a high energy barrier for chair-flipping, and the molecule will exist almost exclusively in the conformation where the larger ethoxycarbonyl group is in the equatorial position. For the purpose of counting distinct protons, we should analyze this single, stable (\"locked\") conformation.\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Protons:**\n    1.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** Since the molecule is chiral and exists in a locked conformation, there is no symmetry to make any of the ring protons equivalent.\n        *   The five methylene groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all in unique chemical environments.\n        *   Within each methylene group, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n        *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct.\n        *   **Ring signals = 10**.\n\n    2.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃) Protons:**\n        *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **Methylene Protons (-OCH₂-):** These two protons are part of a side chain in a chiral molecule. This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent and should, in principle, give two separate signals.\n        *   **Rigorous Count:** 10 (ring) + 2 (-OCH₂-) + 1 (-CH₃) = 13 signals. This is not an option.\n\n*   **Applying a Common Simplification:** In many textbook problems, diastereotopic protons in a flexible acyclic side chain (like the -OCH₂- here) are often simplified and treated as a single signal, as their chemical shift difference can be small. Let's apply this common simplification.\n    *   **Simplified Count:** 10 (ring) + 1 (-OCH₂-) + 1 (-CH₃) = **12 signals**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** This result (12) matches option A. This line of reasoning is the most rigorous one that leads to one of the given answers. It correctly identifies the lack of symmetry in the molecule and only applies a single, very common simplification regarding the side chain. The hint in the question, \"some of them maybe very close in chemical shift,\" strongly supports this detailed analysis, which predicts many distinct signals (10 from the ring alone). The alternative models that yield 5 or 8 signals rely on assuming a plane of symmetry that does not exist, which is a less accurate approach.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction). This replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** Product 1 is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** Product 3 is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n    *   First, NaH, a strong base, removes one of the acidic protons from the carbon atom situated between the two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt).\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule, displacing a bromide ion.\n    *   Since excess NaH is used, the second acidic proton on the same carbon is also removed.\n    *   This new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to displace the second bromide ion. This cyclization forms a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must identify all chemically non-equivalent protons. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires careful consideration of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule has a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1).

They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The same is true for C6. Because the C2 and C6 positions are equivalent due to the symmetry plane, the two axial protons (at C2 and C6) form one set, and the two equatorial protons form another. This results in **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons at these two positions give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n        *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry.

This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the chemical environment of each proton.\n\nThe structure is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon, C1.\n\nThere are two main approaches to analyzing the NMR spectrum of such a molecule, and the correct choice depends on the assumptions made about its conformation and the level of detail required.\n\n**Analysis based on a Time-Averaged Conformation (Rapid Ring Flipping):**\n\nAt room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This creates a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation.

They are in different chemical environments and are not interchangeable by the symmetry operation. Therefore, the two axial protons (on C2 and C6) form one set, and the two equatorial protons form another. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The axial protons are one set, and the equatorial protons are another. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic because replacing one versus the other with a different atom would create diastereomers. They are in different chemical environments. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Signal Count:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 + 1 = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThis analysis is the most rigorous for a molecule undergoing rapid conformational averaging at room temperature and directly addresses the concept of \"chemically distinct\" protons, including diastereotopicity. Several of the provided answers (e.g., 5, 7, 13) correctly use this model to arrive at 8 signals.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe synthesis yields ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. A careful analysis of this molecule's symmetry and the chemical equivalence of its protons reveals 8 distinct sets of hydrogens. This corresponds to option A. Other answers, such as 5 or 12, arise from either oversimplifying the structure (ignoring diastereotopicity) or assuming a non-physical \"locked\" conformation with arbitrary simplifications. The most chemically sound interpretation leads to 8 signals.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Final Product's Structure**\n\nThe reaction sequence described is a standard multi-step organic synthesis. All candidate answers correctly identify the progression:\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Bromoacetic acid:** The first step is an α-bromination of acetic acid, a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) type reaction, yielding bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n2.  **Bromoacetic acid → Ethyl bromoacetate:** The second step is a Fischer esterification with ethanol, yielding ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  **Ethyl bromoacetate → Ethyl cyanoacetate:** The third step is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) with sodium cyanide, yielding ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n4.  **Ethyl cyanoacetate → Final Product 4:** The final step involves a double alkylation using excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. The acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated twice in sequence, first performing an intermolecular alkylation and then an intramolecular cyclization to form a stable six-membered ring.\n\nThe final product (4) is correctly identified by all agents as **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This symmetry dictates which protons are chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton signals based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the molecule's plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** In any given chair conformation, the two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial) are in different spatial environments. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The same is true for C6. Because the C2 and C6 positions are equivalent due to the symmetry plane, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) form one set, and the two equatorial protons form another. This results in **2 signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two attached protons (one axial, one equatorial) are not interchangeable by this symmetry. They are diastereotopic because replacing one versus the other with a different atom would create diastereomers. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. This results in **2 signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Signals**\n\nBy summing the signals from all parts of the molecule, we get:\nTotal Signals = (Signals from ethyl group) + (Signals from cyclohexane ring)\nTotal Signals = 2 + 6 = **8**\n\nThis analysis, which accounts for both the time-averaged symmetry of the flipping ring and the diastereotopicity of geminal protons, is the standard and most chemically accurate approach for this type of problem. It is also the conclusion reached by the majority of the provided candidate answers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
