    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We need to find the relative radius of an exoplanet (`Rpl/Rstar`) that would cause the same dimming as the rotational modulation of a star with spots on one hemisphere.\n\n2.  **Model the Star's Brightness Variation:**\n    *   The brightness of a star (or a part of it) is related to its temperature by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the emitted flux (F) is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (Teff): `F ∝ Teff^4`.\n    *   The star has two distinct states as it rotates:\n        *   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk has a temperature of `Teff_star`. So, `F_max ∝ Teff_star^4`.\n        *   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the hemisphere with spots is facing the observer. A fraction `f` (the filling factor) of this hemisphere's area is covered by cooler spots, while the remaining fraction `(1-f)` has the star's normal temperature.\n        *   Assuming the filling factor `f` applies to the projected disk area, the total flux is a weighted average of the flux from the hot and cool parts: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * Teff_star^4 + f * Teff_spot^4`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Variation:**\n    *   The amplitude of the brightness variation is the fractional change in flux, which is `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    *   Let's substitute the expressions for flux (we can cancel out the proportionality constants and the star's area):\n        `Amplitude = (Teff_star^4 - [(1 - f) * Teff_star^4 + f * Teff_spot^4]) / Teff_star^4`\n    *   Simplify the numerator:\n        `Numerator = Teff_star^4 - Teff_star^4 + f * Teff_star^4 - f * Teff_spot^4`\n        `Numerator = f * (Teff_star^4 - Teff_spot^4)`\n    *   So, the amplitude is:\n        `Amplitude = [f * (Teff_star^4 - Teff_spot^4)] / Teff_star^4`\n        `Amplitude = f * (1 - (Teff_spot^4 / Teff_star^4))`\n        `Amplitude = f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)^4)`\n\n4.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit:**\n    *   When an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light.\n    *   The depth of the transit (the fractional drop in brightness) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n        `Transit Depth = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * Rpl^2) / (π * Rstar^2) = (Rpl / Rstar)^2`.\n\n5.  **Equate the two signals and Solve:**\n    *   We are looking for the case where the transit depth is equal to the amplitude of the spot modulation.\n        `(Rpl / Rstar)^2 = Amplitude`\n        `(Rpl / Rstar)^2 = f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)^4)`\n    *   Now, we can solve for the relative radius `Rpl / Rstar`:\n        `Rpl / Rstar = sqrt[ f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)^4) ]`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    *   Filling factor, `f = 20% = 0.20`\n    *   Star temperature, `Teff_star = 6000 K`\n    *   Spot temperature, `Teff_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n\n    We will use a Python script to perform the calculation precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem description\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere\nTeff_star = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\ndelta_T = 1000  # Temperature difference between the star and the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the temperature of the spots\nTeff_spot = Teff_star - delta_T\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the photometric variation due to spots.\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)**4)\namplitude = f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)**4)\n\n# The amplitude of the signal from the spots is equivalent to the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet.\n# Transit Depth = (Rpl / Rstar)**2\n# Therefore, Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(Amplitude)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 0.3218. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.3218 is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Source of Brightness Variation:** The star's brightness varies because of its rotation. When the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, the star is at its brightest. When the hemisphere with dark, cooler spots faces the observer, the star is at its dimmest. The amplitude of this variation is the signal we need to match.\n\n2.  **Model the Flux from the Star:** According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the energy flux (F) emitted by a star is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (Teff): `F ∝ Teff^4`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Brightness at Maximum and Minimum:**\n    *   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** Occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The flux is proportional to the star's normal temperature: `F_max ∝ Teff_star^4`.\n    *   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** Occurs when the spotted hemisphere is visible. This surface is a composite. A fraction `f` (the filling factor) has the spot temperature (`Teff_spot`), and the remaining fraction `(1-f)` has the star's normal temperature (`Teff_star`). The total flux is a weighted average: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * Teff_star^4 + f * Teff_spot^4`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Amplitude of the Spot Signal:** The amplitude is the fractional change in flux:\n    *   Amplitude = `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    *   Substituting the expressions from step 3 (the proportionality constants and area cancel out):\n        Amplitude = `(Teff_star^4 - [(1 - f) * Teff_star^4 + f * Teff_spot^4]) / Teff_star^4`\n    *   Simplifying the numerator gives: `f * (Teff_star^4 - Teff_spot^4)`\n    *   So, the full expression for the amplitude is:\n        Amplitude = `f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)^4)`\n\n5.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit Signal:** When a planet transits its star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area. This fractional drop in brightness is the transit depth.\n    *   Transit Depth = `Area_planet / Area_star` = `(π * Rpl^2) / (π * Rstar^2)` = `(Rpl / Rstar)^2`\n\n6.  **Equate the Signals and Solve:** We need the transit depth to equal the amplitude of the spot signal.\n    *   `(Rpl / Rstar)^2` = `f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)^4)`\n    *   Therefore, the relative radius of the planet is:\n        `Rpl / Rstar` = `sqrt[ f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)^4) ]`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   `f` = 0.20\n    *   `Teff_star` = 6000 K\n    *   `Teff_spot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Plugging these values into the equation:\n        `Rpl / Rstar` = `sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)^4) ]`\n        `Rpl / Rstar` = `sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) ]`\n        `Rpl / Rstar` = `sqrt[ 0.20 * 0.51775 ]`\n        `Rpl / Rstar` = `sqrt[ 0.10355 ]`\n        `Rpl / Rstar` ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
