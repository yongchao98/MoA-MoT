    "*   **Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the total number of protons:**\n    The problem provides signals corresponding to 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n    Let's check the molecular formula and proton count for the options:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3) has the formula C5H8O2. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8. This matches the data.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (e.g., CH3-CH2-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3) has the formula C6H10O2. The number of hydrogen atoms is 10. This does not match the data.\n    *   Therefore, we can immediately rule out Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate. The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n2.  **Analyze the signal at 2.1 ppm:**\n    *   The signal at `2.1 ppm (3H, s)` indicates three equivalent protons that are not coupled to any neighboring protons (a singlet). This is highly characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate ester (-O-C(=O)-**CH3**). Both propenyl acetate options contain this group.\n\n3.  **Analyze the signals for the propenyl group (CH3-CH=CH-):**\n    Let's label the protons: H3(a)-C-H(b)=C-H(c)-O-\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This represents the methyl group H(a). It is a doublet (d), which means it is coupled to a single adjacent proton, H(b). This is consistent with the `CH3-CH=` structure.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This represents a single proton, H(b). It is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three protons (giving the quartet). This proton is H(b), which is coupled to H(c) (1 proton) and the methyl group H(a) (3 protons). This perfectly matches the `CH3-CH=CH-` structure.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This represents the final proton, H(c). It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to a single adjacent proton, H(b). Its chemical shift is far downfield (7.0 ppm) because it is attached to the deshielding oxygen atom (-CH=CH-**O**-).\n\n4.  **Determine the stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n    *   The key piece of information is the coupling constant (J) for the vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c). The signal for H(c) at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant of `J = 16.0 Hz`.\n    *   For protons on a double bond:\n        *   A *trans* relationship results in a large coupling constant, typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   A *cis* relationship results in a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   Since the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, this indicates a **trans** configuration for the double bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data is consistent with a propenyl acetate structure with a trans double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
