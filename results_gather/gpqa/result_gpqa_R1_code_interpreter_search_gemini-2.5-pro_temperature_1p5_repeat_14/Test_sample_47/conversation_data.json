    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n\n*   This reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone has two alpha-carbons (C2 and C6) that are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. The reaction typically proceeds via an enol or enolate intermediate.\n*   One bromine atom will add to one of the alpha-carbons.\n*   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) → Product 2**\n\n*   This reaction involves an α-halo ketone with a strong base (NaOH). The conditions are classic for a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n*   **Mechanism of Favorskii rearrangement:**\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) abstracts the other acidic α-proton (from C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The ring opens to form a more stable intermediate. To achieve ring contraction from a 6-membered ring to a 5-membered ring, the bond between the original carbonyl carbon (now part of the cyclopropanolate) and an adjacent ring carbon breaks. This leads to the formation of a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylate group.\n    5.  Acidification (which occurs during workup, even from water in the solvent) protonates the carboxylate.\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.** The original 6-membered ring has contracted to a 5-membered ring.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine → Product 3**\n\n*   This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   The -COOH group is converted to a -COCl group.\n*   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) → Product 4**\n\n*   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is selective for the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. Unlike stronger reducing agents like LiAlH₄, it does not reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol. This is a well-known transformation.\n*   The -COCl group is reduced to a -CHO (aldehyde) group.\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n     \n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4 (cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\n*   To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n*   The structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon it's attached to, and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n*   Due to this symmetry, carbons and hydrogens are equivalent if they can be interchanged by reflection through this plane.\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C4.\n\n*   Let's count the distinct types of hydrogens:\n    1.  **Aldehyde H:** The hydrogen atom of the -CHO group. It is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **C1-H:** The hydrogen on the carbon atom to which the aldehyde is attached. This is a methine hydrogen (CH) and is unique. (1 type)\n    3.  **C2-H and C5-H:** Carbons C2 and C5 are equivalent. Each has two hydrogen atoms (a CH₂ group). Because C1 is a stereocenter, the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic (i.e., not equivalent). Similarly, the two hydrogens on C5 are diastereotopic. The plane of symmetry makes the \"upper\" hydrogen on C2 equivalent to the \"upper\" hydrogen on C5, and the \"lower\" hydrogen on C2 equivalent to the \"lower\" hydrogen on C5. Therefore, there are two distinct types of hydrogens at these positions. (2 types)\n    4.  **C3-H and C4-H:** Carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic, and the same for C4. The plane of symmetry makes them equivalent in pairs. Therefore, there are two distinct types of hydrogens at these positions. (2 types)\n\n*   **Total number of chemically distinct hydrogen types = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.**\n\n     \n\nThe six sets of chemically equivalent protons are: Hₐ, Hᵦ, H꜀, H꜀', HᏧ, HᏧ'.\n\n<<<D>>>"
