    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Model and Energy Levels**\n\nThe problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor) for a diatomic molecule. The total energy `E` of the molecule is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies, characterized by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe energy equation is:\nE(v, J) = E_vibrational + E_rotational\nE(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħw + [ħ² / (2I)] * J(J + 1)\n\nwhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   `w` is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n\n**2. Identify the Initial State**\n\nThe molecule is initially in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state. This is the state with the lowest possible energy, occurring when both quantum numbers are at their minimum values: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n\nThe energy of the ground state is:\nE_initial = E(0, 0) = (0 + 1/2)ħw + [ħ² / (2I)] * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħw\n\n**3. Identify the Final State**\n\nThe question asks for the momentum of a photon that causes a transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This phrasing can be interpreted in two ways:\n\n*   **Interpretation A: Absolute next energy level.** This would be the state with the smallest energy greater than E(0,0), which is typically the first rotational level (v=0, J=1).\n*   **Interpretation B: The lowest energy transition allowed by common spectroscopic selection rules.** For absorption in rovibrational spectroscopy, the selection rules are typically Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n\nFrom the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only allowed transition under these rules is to the state (v=1, J=1). Let's calculate the energy for this transition and see if it matches the provided options.\n\nThe final state is (v=1, J=1). Its energy is:\nE_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħw + [ħ² / (2I)] * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħw + ħ²/I\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon, `ΔE`, must be equal to the difference between the final and initial energy states.\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\nΔE = [ (3/2)ħw + ħ²/I ] - [ (1/2)ħw ]\nΔE = ħw + ħ²/I\n\nTo calculate this, we first need to find the moment of inertia, `I`.\n`I = μ * R²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass and `R` is the bond length.\n\nThe reduced mass `μ` is calculated as:\nμ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n\n**5.
