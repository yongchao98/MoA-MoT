    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    The core task is to compare two energy values:\n    *   **The paramagnetic coupling energy (`<H>`)**: This is the energy of interaction between the electron's orbital magnetic moment and an external magnetic field. It is a manifestation of the Zeeman effect.\n    *   **The transition energy (`ΔE`)**: This is the energy difference between two atomic levels in the Hydrogen atom, corresponding to a specific spectral line given by its wavelength ($\\lambda$).\n\n2.  **Formulate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy (`<H>`)**:\n    *   The Hamiltonian for the interaction between an orbital magnetic moment ($\\vec{\\mu}_L$) and an external magnetic field ($\\vec{B}$) is given by:\n        $H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n    *   The orbital magnetic moment of an electron is related to its orbital angular momentum ($\\vec{L}$) by:\n        $\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L}$\n        where `e` is the elementary charge and `m_e` is the electron mass.\n    *   Substituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n        $H = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n    *   The problem states the magnetic field is parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$. The dot product simplifies to:\n        $\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$\n    *   The expectation value of this energy, `<H>`, is what we need to calculate. The operator for the z-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, has eigenvalues of $m\\hbar$, where `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n        $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{e}{2m_e} L_z B \\right\\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} \\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} (m\\hbar)$\n    *   This expression can be simplified by introducing the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$.\n        $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\mu_B m B$\n    *   The problem provides `B = 1 T` and states `m` has small values. We will use `m = 1` for calculation, as it's the smallest non-zero integer value, representing a typical case for this interaction.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Transition Energy (`ΔE`)**:\n    *   The energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during an atomic transition is related to its wavelength ($\\lambda$) by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n        $\\Delta E = h\\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n    *   The problem provides the wavelength $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu m = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This corresponds to the blue-green H-beta line in the Balmer series of hydrogen (transition from n=4 to n=2).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Numerical Values**:\n    To compare the two energies, we will calculate their values using fundamental physical constants. We'll use a Python script for precision.\n\n    *   **Constants**:\n        *   Bohr magneton ($\\mu_B$) ≈ $9.274 \\times 10^{-24}$ J/T\n        *   Planck's constant (h) ≈ $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s\n        *   Speed of light (c) ≈ $3.00 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   **Given Values**:\n        *   Magnetic field (B) = 1 T\n        *   Orbital magnetic quantum number (m) = 1 (a small, representative value)\n        *   Wavelength ($\\lambda$) = $0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical constants in SI units\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant (J·s)\nc = 299792458       # Speed of light (m/s)\ne = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge (C)\nm_e = 9.1093837e-31   # Electron mass (kg)\nhbar = h / (2 * np.pi)\n\n# Bohr Magneton\nmu_B = (e * hbar) / (2 * m_e)\n\n# --- Problem Parameters ---\n# Paramagnetic coupling term\nB = 1.0  # Magnetic field in Tesla\nm = 1    # Small orbital magnetic quantum number\n\n# Transition energy\nlambda_val = 0.4861e-6  # Wavelength in meters\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# 1.

    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe goal is to compare the magnitude of two distinct energy values:\n*   The paramagnetic coupling energy, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$, which arises from the interaction of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field (a form of Zeeman effect).\n*   The transition energy, $\\Delta E$, which is the energy difference between two electronic levels in a Hydrogen atom, corresponding to a photon of a given wavelength.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the interaction of a magnetic dipole moment $\\vec{\\mu_L}$ with an external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is:\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu_L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu_L}$ is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu_L} = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field is parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The expression for the energy becomes:\n$H = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} L_z$\n\nThe expectation value $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$ depends on the expectation value of the z-component of angular momentum, $\\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle$. For an electron in a state with orbital magnetic quantum number $m$, the eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar$. Thus:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} m\\hbar$\n\nThis can be simplified by introducing the **Bohr magneton**, $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1\\text{ T}$\n*   $m$ is a small number. We will use $m=1$ as a representative value, as it's the smallest non-zero integer for this effect.\n*   The value of the Bohr magneton is $\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$.\n\nCalculating this energy:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = 1 \\cdot (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\cdot (1 \\text{ T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during an atomic transition is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n*   Planck's constant, $h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n*   The speed of light, $c \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nCalculating this energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}) \\cdot (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} \\approx 4.088 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\nThe more precise value from the code execution is $4.0865 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Magnitudes**\n\nNow, we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic Energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n*   Transition Energy: $\\Delta E = 4.0865 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\nBy looking at the powers of 10, we can immediately see that the transition energy $\\Delta E$ (order of $10^{-19}$) is much larger than the paramagnetic coupling energy $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$ (order of $10^{-24}$).\n\nTo quantify this, we can look at their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{4.0865 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nSince this ratio is extremely small, it confirms that the paramagnetic energy is negligible compared to the energy of the electronic transition. This is a general principle in atomic physics: the energy shifts due to external fields (Zeeman and Stark effects) are typically much smaller than the energy differences between the main electronic shells.\n\nTherefore, the relationship is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\n**2.
