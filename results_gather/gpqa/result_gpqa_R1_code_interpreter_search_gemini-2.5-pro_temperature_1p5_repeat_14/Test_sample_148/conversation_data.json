    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Observations:**\n    *   **Observation 1 (¹H NMR):** Two distinct peaks are observed for a single proton (an alpha-proton). They have similar chemical environments (similar chemical shifts) and are present in equal amounts (roughly equal integrals that sum to 1H). A key piece of information is that spin-spin coupling is *not* the cause. This means the two peaks represent two different, yet very similar, molecular species.\n    *   **Observation 2 (LC-MS):** The liquid chromatography (LC) trace shows two separate peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two distinct chemical compounds that can be physically separated. The mass spectrometry (MS) data shows that both of these compounds have the *same* mass, and this mass corresponds to the expected target molecule. The separation is maintained even at elevated temperatures, suggesting the two species are stable isomers and not just conformers that would rapidly interconvert and coalesce at high temperatures.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Possible Explanations:**\n\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** In peptide synthesis, \"double coupling\" is a strategy to ensure a reaction goes to completion by performing the coupling step twice. It is a process, not a final product state. If it resulted in an unwanted side product, like adding two amino acids instead of one, the mass would be different. This contradicts the MS data where both peaks have the *correct* mass. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror-image stereoisomers. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. This means they are indistinguishable by standard ¹H NMR (they would produce a single set of peaks) and by standard LC (they would elute at the same time, producing a single peak). To separate them, a chiral environment is required (e.g., a chiral NMR solvent or a chiral LC column), which is not mentioned. Since the observations clearly show two distinct species by both NMR and LC, this cannot be a mixture of enantiomers. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. This situation arises when a molecule has at least two chiral centers, and the configuration differs at one or more, but not all, of them.\n        *   **NMR Properties:** Diastereoisomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties. They will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers will have slightly different chemical shifts, which perfectly explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton. If they are formed in a 1:1 ratio, the peak integrals will be equal. This matches the NMR data.\n        *   **LC-MS Properties:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated using standard (achiral) chromatography. This explains the two peaks in the LC trace. Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass, which explains why both LC peaks give the identical, correct mass spectrum. This perfectly matches the LC-MS data.\n        *   **Chemical Context:** In peptide synthesis, a mixture of diastereomers can easily be formed if one of the chiral amino acid building blocks was not enantiomerically pure (i.e., it was a racemic D/L mixture), or if epimerization (racemization at a single chiral center) occurred at some point during the synthesis or workup. This is a very common scenario in peptide chemistry.\n        *   This explanation is fully consistent with all experimental observations.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate from an earlier step in the synthesis. It would almost certainly have a different chemical structure and therefore a different molecular mass than the final product. The MS data explicitly shows that both separated peaks have the same mass, which is that of the *final product*. This directly rules out contamination by a precursor. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the data (two NMR peaks for one proton, two separable LC peaks, and identical correct mass for both peaks) is that the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
