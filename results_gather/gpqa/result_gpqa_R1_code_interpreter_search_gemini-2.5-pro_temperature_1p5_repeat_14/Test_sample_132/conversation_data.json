    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species in the solution:**\n    *   KH2PO4 dissolves in water to give K+ ions and dihydrogen phosphate ions (H2PO4-).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissolves in water to give Na+ ions, hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO4^2-), and water molecules.\n    *   Therefore, the solution contains a weak acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). This pair forms a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of the buffer components:**\n    *   The molar mass (Mw) of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   The molar mass (Mw) of Na2HPO4●2H2O is 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 (which gives H2PO4-) = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O (which gives HPO4^2-) = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n    *   Concentration [H2PO4-] = Moles of H2PO4- / Volume.\n    *   Concentration [HPO4^2-] = Moles of HPO4^2- / Volume.\n\n4.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]**:\n    *   The pH of the solution is governed by the equilibrium of the H2PO4- / HPO4^2- buffer system, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\n    *   The equilibrium reaction is: H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\n    *   The acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8.\n    *   The expression for Ka2 is: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]: [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]).\n    *   For a buffer, we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations of the acid and base with their initial concentrations, as the extent of dissociation is small.\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]**:\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.\n    *   The equilibrium reaction is: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\n    *   The acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12.\n    *   The expression for Ka3 is: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]: [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+].\n    *   We use the [H+] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-] (as its dissociation into PO4^3- is negligible and doesn't significantly change its concentration).\n\nNow, we will perform the calculations using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem statement\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # in grams\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # in g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # in grams\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # in g/mol\nvolume = 0.20000  # in Liters\nka2 = 6.2e-8\nka3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Calculate moles and initial concentrations\n# Moles of H2PO4-\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\n# Concentration of H2PO4-\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume\n\n# Moles of HPO4^2-\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n# Concentration of HPO4^2-\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n# We assume the initial concentrations are good approximations for the equilibrium concentrations.\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nh_plus_concentration = ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n# Again, we use the initial concentration of HPO4^2- as a good approximation.\npo4_3minus_concentration = ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / h_plus_concentration)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation to match the options.\nprint(f\"{po4_3minus_concentration:.3e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.235e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.235x10^-7 M. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\nB) 5.48x10^-7 M\nC) 3.97x10^-7 M\nD) 2.81x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
