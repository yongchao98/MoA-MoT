    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Annihilation Process:**\n    The process is the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$).\n    $p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State:**\n    *   The initial state consists of a proton and an antiproton.\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. To conserve momentum (as we will see), this suggests we are in the center-of-momentum frame, where both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n    *   **Initial Energy ($E_i$):** The total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton. The kinetic energies are considered to be zero.\n        *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n        *   Rest mass energy of an antiproton is the same, $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2$.\n        *   Therefore, $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   **Initial Momentum ($P_i$):** Since both particles are at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. $P_i = 0$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   All four particles have the same mass, $m_A$, with a rest mass energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   **Final Momentum ($P_f$):** By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must equal the total initial momentum. So, $P_f = P_i = 0$. This means the four particles must move away from the annihilation point in such a way that their vector momenta sum to zero.\n    *   **Final Energy ($E_f$):** The total final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles. Since momentum is conserved, and the initial particles were identical (in mass), the final particles must share the energy equally to conserve momentum. Therefore, they will all have the same speed, $v$.\n        *   The relativistic energy of a single particle A is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n        *   The total final energy for the four particles is $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the reaction must equal the total energy after the reaction.\n    $E_i = E_f$\n    $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    We can now substitute the known values into the equation to solve for $\\gamma$.\n    $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    $1876.54 = 1200 \\gamma$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Velocity ($v$):**\n    Now that we have the Lorentz factor, we can solve for the velocity, $v$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n    Substitute the value of $\\gamma \\approx 1.5638$:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$. This corresponds to option B.\n\nTo ensure precision, the calculation can be performed using a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.27208816  # Proton rest mass energy in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300  # Particle A rest mass energy in MeV\n\n# Total initial energy (E_i)\nE_i = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Total final energy (E_f) = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# From conservation of energy, E_i = E_f\n# 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# Solve for gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Solve for v/c from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# (v/c)^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2\nv_over_c = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / gamma**2)\n\nprint(f\"v/c = {v_over_c:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\nv/c = 0.7688\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The annihilation process is given by $p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$.\nWe apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n1.  **Initial State:**\n    *   The problem states the antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. In the center-of-momentum frame, both the proton ($p$) and the antiproton are considered to be at rest.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n        $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n    *   Since a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass, $m_p = m_{\\bar{p}}$. The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n        $E_i = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The total initial momentum is zero since the particles are at rest.\n\n2.  **Final State:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$), all with the same mass $m_A$.\n    *   The rest mass energy of particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the total energy of the initial state will be distributed equally among the four final particles. Therefore, each particle A will have the same total energy, $E_A$, and the same speed, $v$.\n    *   The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula:\n        $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n        $E_f = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   We set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n        $E_i = E_f$\n        $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n4.  **Solve for Velocity (v):**\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV}}{4 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.563$\n    *   Now, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to solve for the velocity $v$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.443}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.409} = \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.769$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
