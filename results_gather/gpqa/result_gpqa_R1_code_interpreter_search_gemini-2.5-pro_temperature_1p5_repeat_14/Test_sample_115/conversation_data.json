    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound D.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   The proton NMR spectrum of Compound A shows two signals.\n*   A triplet at 0.9 ppm with an integration of 6H. A triplet (3 peaks) means the neighboring carbon has 2 protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). The 6H integration suggests two equivalent methyl groups (-CH3). So, we have two CH3 groups each adjacent to a CH2 group.\n*   A quartet at 1.3 ppm with an integration of 4H. A quartet (4 peaks) means the neighboring carbon has 3 protons (n+1 rule, 3+1=4). The 4H integration suggests two equivalent methylene groups (-CH2). So, we have two CH2 groups each adjacent to a CH3 group.\n*   Putting this together, we have two equivalent ethyl groups (CH3-CH2-).\n*   The chemical shifts (0.9 ppm and 1.3 ppm) are characteristic of a simple alkane. The only simple alkane with two equivalent ethyl groups is n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3). Although the inner CH2 groups should technically be a multiplet (sextet) from coupling to both the adjacent CH3 and CH2 groups, in many contexts, the major coupling to the CH3 is considered, leading to the simplified description of a quartet.\n*   Therefore, **Compound A is n-butane**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\n\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. This is a free-radical halogenation.\n*   Bromination of n-butane can occur at C1 (primary carbon) or C2 (secondary carbon).\n*   Radical bromination is selective, favoring the more stable secondary radical over the primary radical. Thus, the major product is 2-bromobutane.\n*   Therefore, **Compound B is 2-bromobutane** (CH3-CH(Br)-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\n\n*   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a strong base in a polar protic solvent, conditions that favor an E2 elimination reaction.\n*   According to Zaitsev's rule, elimination will preferentially form the more substituted (more stable) alkene.\n    *   Elimination of H from C1 gives but-1-ene (less substituted).\n    *   Elimination of H from C3 gives but-2-ene (more substituted).\n*   The major product is but-2-ene. The problem states that Compound C has two geometrical isomers. But-2-ene exists as *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene.\n*   Therefore, **Compound C is but-2-ene**. The specific reactant for the next step is the *cis*-isomer.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound D**\n\n*   The *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. This is a Diels-Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   **Dienophile**: *cis*-but-2-ene.\n    *   **Diene**: (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol (HO-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   The reaction forms a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative). Let's determine the structure and stereochemistry.\n\n**Structure:**\n*   The diene provides carbons for positions 1, 2, 3, and 6 of the new ring. It contributes an -OH group at C1 and a -CH3 group at C6.\n*   The dienophile provides carbons for positions 4 and 5, each contributing a -CH3 group.\n*   The resulting product is a **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This eliminates options A and C, which have a 4,6,6-trimethyl substitution pattern.\n\n**Stereochemistry:**\nWe must consider the stereochemical consequences of the Diels-Alder reaction.\n1.  **From the dienophile**: The reaction is stereospecific. Since we start with *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups (at C4 and C5 of the product) must be **cis** to each other.\n2.  **From the diene**: The stereochemistry of the diene's termini also translates to the product. For a diene with E,E-stereochemistry like (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol, the two outer substituents (the -OH group and the -CH3 group) will end up **cis** to each other in the cyclohexene product (at positions C1 and C6).\n3.  **Endo/Exo Selectivity**: This determines the relative orientation between the dienophile's substituents and the diene's substituents. The \"endo rule\" usually predicts the major product. However, the endo transition state can be sterically hindered. In the exo transition state, the dienophile's substituents point away from the diene. Given the steric bulk of the *cis*-methyl groups on the dienophile, the **exo** pathway is favored. In the exo product, the substituents from the diene {OH at C1, Me at C6} are **cis** to the substituents from the dienophile {Me at C4, Me at C5}.\n\n**Summary of Relative Stereochemistry (Exo Product):**\n*   {Me at C4, Me at C5} are cis.\n*   {OH at C1, Me at C6} are cis.\n*   The {C4, C5} pair is cis to the {C1, C6} pair.\n*   This means all four substituents (-OH at C1, -Me at C4, -Me at C5, -Me at C6) are on the **same face** of the cyclohexene ring.\n\n**Assigning R/S Configuration:**\nLet's analyze the enantiomer where all four substituents are \"up\" (wedged). We can then determine its R/S configuration and find its match in the options.\n*   The priorities for each chiral center are determined using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules.\n    *   C1: -OH > -C2=C > -C6 > -H\n    *   C4: -C3=C > -C5 > -CH3 > -H\n    *   C5: -C6 > -C4 > -CH3 > -H (C6 is attached to C1 with an -OH group, giving it priority over C4)\n    *   C6: -C1 > -C5 > -CH3 > -H (C1 has an -OH group, giving it priority)\n*   Assigning the configuration for the \"all-up\" enantiomer:\n    *   **C1**: 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise -> **R**\n    *   **C4**: 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise -> **S**\n    *   **C5**: 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise -> **R**\n    *   **C6**: 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise -> **S**\n*   This gives the (1R, 4S, 5R, 6S) enantiomer. The reaction produces a racemic mixture, so its enantiomer, **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)**, is also formed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing our result with the options:\nA) (1S,4S)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol (Incorrect structure)\nB) (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol (Incorrect stereochemistry at C6)\nC) (1S,4R)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol (Incorrect structure)\nD) (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol (Matches the enantiomer of our derived exo product)\n\nTherefore, compound D is (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<D>>>"
