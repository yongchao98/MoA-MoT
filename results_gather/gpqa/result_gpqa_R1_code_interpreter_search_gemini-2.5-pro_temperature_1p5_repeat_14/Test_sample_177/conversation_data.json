    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density\n\nIn a 4-dimensional spacetime, the action `S` is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density `L` over spacetime:\n`S = ∫ d⁴x L`\nThe action `S` must be a dimensionless quantity in natural units (where `ħ = c = 1`).\nThe spacetime volume element `d⁴x` has units of `(length)⁴`. In natural units, mass has dimensions of `(length)⁻¹`. Therefore, `d⁴x` has a mass dimension of `[d⁴x] = -4`.\nFor the action `S` to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension that compensates for `d⁴x`.\n`[S] = [d⁴x] [L] = -4 + [L] = 0`\nThis implies that the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density must be `[L] = 4`.\n\n### 2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields\n\nTo find the mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ`, we first need to determine the mass dimensions of the fields involved in the interaction term: the fermion field `ψ` and the electromagnetic field strength tensor `F`<sup>`μν`</sup>.\n\n*   **Fermion Field (ψ):**\n    The kinetic term for a fermion field is given by `L_ψ =  ψ̄(iγ`<sup>`μ`</sup>`∂_μ - m)ψ`. The entire term `L_ψ` must have a mass dimension of 4. Let's analyze the `ψ̄(iγ`<sup>`μ`</sup>`∂_μ)ψ` part.\n    *   The derivative `∂_μ` has a mass dimension of `[∂_μ] = 1`.\n    *   The gamma matrices `γ`<sup>`μ`</sup> are dimensionless.\n    *   The fields `ψ` and `ψ̄` have the same mass dimension, `[ψ] = [ψ̄]`.\n    *   So, for the kinetic term, we have `[ψ̄] + [∂_μ] + [ψ] = 4`.\n    *   `2[ψ] + 1 = 4`.\n    *   `2[ψ] = 3`.\n    *   `[ψ] = 3/2`.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic Field Strength (F<sup>μν</sup>):**\n    The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_A = -1/4 F_μν F`<sup>`μν`</sup>. This term must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n    *   `[F_μν F`<sup>`μν`</sup>`] = 4`.\n    *   Since `[F_μν] = [F`<sup>`μν`</sup>`]`, we have `2[F`<sup>`μν`</sup>`] = 4`.\n    *   `[F`<sup>`μν`</sup>`] = 2`.\n\n### 3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant κ\n\nNow we can analyze the interaction Lagrangian:\n`L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_μν ψ F`<sup>`μν`</sup>\nThe mass dimension of this entire term must be 4.\n`[L_int] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ_μν] + [ψ] + [F`<sup>`μν`</sup>`] = 4`\n\nLet's find the dimension of each component:\n*   `[ψ̄] = 3/2`\n*   `[ψ] = 3/2`\n*   `[F`<sup>`μν`</sup>`] = 2`\n*   `σ_μν = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]` is composed of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Thus, `[σ_μν] = 0`.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`[κ] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 3 + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 5 = 4`\n`[κ] = -1`\n\nSo, the mass dimension of `κ` is -1.\n\n### 4. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. This is known as power-counting renormalizability.\n\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension (`[g] > 0`), the interaction is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension (`[g] = 0`), the interaction is **renormalizable**. (e.g., the electric charge `e` in QED).\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension (`[g] < 0`), the interaction is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn this case, the coupling constant `κ` has a mass dimension of -1. Since the dimension is negative, the theory is **not renormalizable**. Higher-order corrections in perturbation theory would require an infinite number of counter-terms to cancel all the divergences, rendering the theory non-predictive at high energies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The mass dimension `[κ]_M = -1`.\n*   Because the mass dimension of the coupling constant is negative, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
