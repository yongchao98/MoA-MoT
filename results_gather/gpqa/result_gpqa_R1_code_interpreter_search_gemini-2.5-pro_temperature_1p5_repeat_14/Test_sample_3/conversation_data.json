    "This is a classic thought experiment in physics that explores the symmetry of electricity and magnetism. Let's break down Maxwell's equations and see how they would be affected by the existence of magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles).\n\n### Standard Maxwell's Equations\n\nIn our universe, without observed magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations are:\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** `∇ ⋅ E = ρ / ε₀`\n    *   **Meaning:** The divergence (`∇ ⋅`) of the electric field (`E`) is proportional to the electric charge density (`ρ`). This means electric field lines originate from positive charges and terminate on negative charges. It relates the **flux of the electric field** to the enclosed electric charge.\n\n2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** `∇ ⋅ B = 0`\n    *   **Meaning:** The divergence of the magnetic field (`B`) is zero. This is the mathematical statement that there are no magnetic monopoles. Magnetic field lines are always continuous loops; they never start or end at a point. It relates the **flux (and divergence) of the magnetic field**.\n\n3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** `∇ × E = -∂B/∂t`\n    *   **Meaning:** The curl (`∇ ×`) of the electric field describes its circulation. This equation states that a time-varying magnetic field (`∂B/∂t`) creates a circulating electric field. It relates the **circulation of the electric field**.\n\n4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law:** `∇ × B = μ₀(J + ε₀∂E/∂t)`\n    *   **Meaning:** The curl of the magnetic field is caused by an electric current (`J`) and/or a time-varying electric field (`∂E/∂t`). It relates the **circulation of the magnetic field**.\n\n### Introducing Magnetic Monopoles\n\nIf magnetic monopoles existed, they would be sources or sinks for the magnetic field, just as electric charges are for the electric field. This would require two key changes to create a symmetric set of equations:\n\n1.  **Change to Gauss's Law for Magnetism:**\n    *   The equation `∇ ⋅ B = 0` is a direct statement that there are *no* magnetic sources. If magnetic monopoles (with a magnetic charge density, let's call it `ρ_m`) existed, this law would have to be modified to be analogous to Gauss's Law for Electricity.\n    *   **New Equation:** `∇ ⋅ B = μ₀ρ_m` (The exact constant `μ₀` is a matter of convention, but the key is that the divergence is no longer zero).\n    *   **Impact:** The equation for the **divergence of the magnetic field** changes.\n\n2.  **Change to Faraday's Law of Induction:**\n    *   Symmetry is a powerful guide in physics. The Ampère-Maxwell law says an *electric current* creates a circulating magnetic field. Symmetrically, a *magnetic current* (moving magnetic monopoles, with current density `J_m`) should create a circulating electric field.\n    *   This new source term would be added to Faraday's Law.\n    *   **New Equation:** `∇ × E = - (∂B/∂t + μ₀J_m)`\n    *   **Impact:** The equation for the **circulation of the electric field** changes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe two equations that would be different are:\n*   Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the **divergence of the magnetic field**)\n*   Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the **circulation of the electric field**)\n\nThis corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
