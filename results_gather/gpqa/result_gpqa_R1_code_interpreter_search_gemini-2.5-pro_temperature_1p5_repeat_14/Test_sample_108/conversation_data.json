    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `1S0` means:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1`  =>  Total spin `S(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   `S` (spectroscopic notation) => Orbital angular momentum `L(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   `0` => Total angular momentum `J(NN_initial) = 0`.\n*   **Parity:** The parity of the initial state is given by `P = P_intrinsic * (-1)^L`. For a two-nucleon system, the intrinsic parity `P_intrinsic = (+1) * (+1) = +1`. Thus, the initial parity is `P_initial = (+1) * (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin:** According to the generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two nucleons, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition `L + S + T` must be an odd integer.\n    *   For the initial `1S0` state, `L=0` and `S=0`.\n    *   `0 + 0 + T(NN_initial)` must be odd, which implies `T(NN_initial) = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `J=0`, `P=+1`, `T=1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`. We are given several properties of the final state:\n*   The emitted particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n*   The final two-nucleon state `NN(final)` has isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n*   Let the quantum numbers of the final NN state be `S(NN_final)`, `L(NN_final)`, and `J(NN_final)`.\n*   Let the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle `X` be `l_X`. The lowercase letters `s, p, d, f` correspond to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nWe must apply three rules to check if a transition is permitted:\n\n**Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n*   The initial total angular momentum is `J(initial) = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum `J(final) = J(NN_final) + l_X`.\n*   For `J(final)` to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN_final) = l_X`.\n\n**Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n*   `P(initial) = P(final)`.\n*   `P(initial) = +1`.\n*   `P(final) = P(NN_final) * (-1)^L(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   Substituting the known parities: `+1 = (+1) * (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   This simplifies to `+1 = -(-1)^(L(NN_final) + l_X)`, which means `(-1)^(L(NN_final) + l_X) = -1`.\n*   Therefore, the sum `L(NN_final) + l_X` must be an odd integer.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n*   The problem explicitly gives the condition: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final state has `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n*   Substituting `T=0`: `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds only if `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` is an odd integer.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now check each of the proposed transitions against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it fails any one of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J Cons):** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. `1 = 1`. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity Cons):** `L+l_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. Odd. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S+L` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. Odd. **Pass.**\n*   Conclusion: **Permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X state (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J Cons):** `J=3`, `l_X=3`. `3 = 3`. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity Cons):** `L+l_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. Odd. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S+L` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. Odd. **Pass.**\n*   Conclusion: **Permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X state (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J Cons):** `J=0`, `l_X=0`. `0 = 0`. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity Cons):** `L+l_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. Odd. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S+L` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. Even. **Fail.**\n*   Conclusion: **Not Permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` => `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   Note: A two-nucleon system (each with spin 1/2) cannot have a total spin of S=3. The maximum possible spin is S=1. Therefore, this final state is unphysical for a two-nucleon system. However, the question asks to check the selection rules. We will proceed by mechanically applying the rules as instructed.\n*   **Rule 1 (J Cons):** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. `1 = 1`. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity Cons):** `L+l_X` odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. Odd. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S+L` odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. Odd. **Pass.**\n*   Conclusion: If we strictly follow the given rules, this transition is permitted. The issue lies in the physical existence of the final state, which is external to the selection rules being tested.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the options, the transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the only one that violates one of the explicit selection rules given in the problem (specifically, the Pauli statistics condition for the final T=0 state). Therefore, this is the partial wave that is not permitted.\n\n<<<C>>>"
