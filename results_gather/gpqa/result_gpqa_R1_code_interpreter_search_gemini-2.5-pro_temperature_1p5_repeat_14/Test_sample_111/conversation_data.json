    "This is a quantum mechanics problem involving a two-level system (spin-1/2 electron). We need to find probabilities of measurement outcomes and the expectation value of a given operator.\n\n### 1. Normalize the initial state |α⟩\nThe state is given as `|α⟩ ∝ (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩`.\nLet `|α⟩ = N * [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]`, where N is the normalization constant.\nThe normalization condition is `⟨α|α⟩ = 1`.\n\nThe bra vector is `⟨α| = N* * [(1-i)⟨up| + (2+i)⟨down|]`.\nThe inner product `⟨α|α⟩` is:\n`|N|^2 * [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) ] = 1`\n`|N|^2 * [ (1^2 - i^2) + (2^2 - i^2) ] = 1`\n`|N|^2 * [ (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) ] = 1`\n`|N|^2 * [ 2 + 5 ] = 1`\n`|N|^2 * 7 = 1`\n`|N|^2 = 1/7`, so we can choose `N = 1/√7`.\n\nThe normalized state is:\n`|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [ (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩ ]`\nIn vector notation, where `|up⟩ = [1, 0]^T` and `|down⟩ = [0, 1]^T`, the state is:\n`|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [ 1+i, 2-i ]^T`\n\n### 2. Define the operator A and find its eigenstates and eigenvalues\nThe operator `A` has matrix elements `Aij = ħ/2` if `i ≠ j` and `0` otherwise. For a 2x2 system, this is:\n`A = [ A11 A12 ] = [ 0   ħ/2 ]`\n    `[ A21 A22 ]   [ ħ/2  0  ]`\n`A = (ħ/2) * [ 0 1 ] = (ħ/2)σ_x`, where `σ_x` is the Pauli-X matrix.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`λ`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([ -λ   ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2  -λ ]) = 0`\n`(-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = 0`\n`λ^2 - (ħ/2)^2 = 0`\n`λ^2 = (ħ^2)/4`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +ħ/2` and `λ₂ = -ħ/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates (`|v⟩`).\n\n**For λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n`(A - λ₁I)|v₁⟩ = 0`\n`[ -ħ/2  ħ/2 ] [x] = [0]`\n`[  ħ/2 -ħ/2 ] [y]   [0]`\nThis gives the equation `(-ħ/2)x + (ħ/2)y = 0`, which simplifies to `x = y`.\nAn unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]^T`.\nNormalizing it: `(1/√(1²+1²)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/√2) * [1, 1]^T`.\nSo, `|v₁⟩ = (1/√2) * (|up⟩ + |down⟩)`.\n\n**For λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n`(A - λ₂I)|v₂⟩ = 0`\n`[ ħ/2  ħ/2 ] [x] = [0]`\n`[ ħ/2  ħ/2 ] [y]   [0]`\nThis gives the equation `(ħ/2)x + (ħ/2)y = 0`, which simplifies to `x = -y`.\nAn unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]^T`.\nNormalizing it: `(1/√(1²+(-1)²)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/√2) * [1, -1]^T`.\nSo, `|v₂⟩ = (1/√2) * (|up⟩ - |down⟩)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the probabilities\nThe probability of measuring the eigenvalue `λi` is `P(λi) = |⟨vi|α⟩|²`.\n\n**Probability P₁ for eigenvalue λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n`⟨v₁| = (1/√2) * [1, 1]`\n`⟨v₁|α⟩ = (1/√2)[1, 1] * (1/√7)[1+i, 2-i]^T`\n`⟨v₁|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]`\n`⟨v₁|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [1 + i + 2 - i] = 3/√14`\n`P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n**Probability P₂ for eigenvalue λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n`⟨v₂| = (1/√2) * [1, -1]`\n`⟨v₂|α⟩ = (1/√2)[1, -1] * (1/√7)[1+i, 2-i]^T`\n`⟨v₂|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]`\n`⟨v₂|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [1 + i - 2 + i] = (-1 + 2i)/√14`\n`P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nAs a check, `P₁ + P₂ = 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`.\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Find the average (expectation) value ⟨A⟩\nThe expectation value `⟨A⟩` can be calculated as `⟨α|A|α⟩`.\n\n`A|α⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ 0 1 ] * (1/√7) * [ 1+i ] = (ħ/(2√7)) * [ 2-i ]`\n             `[ 1 0 ]            [ 2-i ]            [ 1+i ]`\n\n`⟨A⟩ = ⟨α| (A|α⟩) = (1/√7) * [1-i, 2+i] * (ħ/(2√7)) * [ 2-i ]`\n                                                       `[ 1+i ]`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ/14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ/14) * [ (2 - i - 2i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²) ]`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ/14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ/14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ]`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ/14) * [ 2 ] = ħ/7`\n\nAlternatively, using the probabilities:\n`⟨A⟩ = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂ = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7`\n\n### Conclusion\nThe probabilities are `9/14 ≈ 0.64` and `5/14 ≈ 0.36`.\nThe average value is `ħ/7`.\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
