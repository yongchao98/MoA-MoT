    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem involves the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows us to use the **Boltzmann equation** to describe this population distribution.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states, an excited state `j` and a lower state `i`:\n    (N_j / N_i) = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   N_j, N_i are the number of atoms in states j and i.\n    *   g_j, g_i are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   ΔE = E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to both stars:**\n    *   For star_1 with temperature T_1, the excitation ratio is:\n        `(N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n    *   For star_2 with temperature T_2, the excitation ratio is:\n        `(N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n4.  **Incorporate the condition from the problem:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Mathematically, this means:\n    `(N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the condition:**\n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for the statistical weights, (g_j / g_i), is a property of the specific iron transition and is the same for both stars. Therefore, it cancels out from both sides:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n7.  **Solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2:** To isolate the temperatures from the exponents, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + [-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n8.  **Rearrange the equation to match the options:** We want to find an expression for `ln(2)`.\n    `ln(2) = -ΔE / (k * T_1) + ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\n    Now, combine the fractions in the parenthesis by finding a common denominator (T_1 * T_2):\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n9.  **Substitute the given physical constants:** The problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n    Let's calculate the ratio ΔE / k:\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K`\n\n10. **Finalize the equation:** Substituting `ΔE / k = 1` into our derived relationship:\n    `ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n11. **Compare with the given options:** This final equation matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
