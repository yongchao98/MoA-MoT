    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone. Let's identify the chiral center. The name indicates the stereochemistry at carbon 5 is (S).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The chiral center is C5.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol group (CH-OH).\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged during the reaction.\n    *   The ketone at C3 is prochiral. The incoming hydride ion can attack from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new stereocenter C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements at one (but not all) stereocenters. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is symmetric and achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The term \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n    *   Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. The reaction is expected to produce them in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has a plane of symmetry passing through C3. It is a **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same molecule as (2R, 4S)).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces a total of **three stereoisomers**: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Separation on Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Key principle:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated (they co-elute, appearing as a single peak).\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R) + (2S,4S)) and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomeric pair will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomers, so it will elute at a different time, giving another **1 peak**.\n    *   Total from Reaction II is 1 + 1 = **2 peaks**.\n*   **Combined Mixture:** We need to consider if peaks from Reaction I products might accidentally overlap with peaks from Reaction II products.\n    *   Reaction I products: C₇H₁₆O₂ (ether-alcohols)\n    *   Reaction II products: C₅H₁₂O₂ (diols)\n    *   The compounds have different molecular formulas, molecular weights, and functionalities (one ether and one alcohol vs. two alcohols). Their polarities will be significantly different. It is a standard and safe assumption in such problems that they will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Separation on Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. It is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Key principle:** A chiral column can distinguish between all unique stereoisomers (both enantiomers and diastereomers), assuming the column is suitable for the compounds.\n*   We simply need to count the total number of unique stereoisomeric products formed.\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have 2 unique diastereomers. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have 3 unique stereoisomers (the two enantiomers and the meso compound). A chiral column will resolve the enantiomers from each other, and both from the meso compound. This gives **3 peaks**.\n*   **Combined Mixture:** Again, we assume no accidental co-elution between the products of the two different reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 3 peaks (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
