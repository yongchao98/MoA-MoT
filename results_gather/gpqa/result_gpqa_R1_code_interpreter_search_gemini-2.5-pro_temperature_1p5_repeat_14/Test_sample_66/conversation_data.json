    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state of the system.**\n    The system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    This notation tells us:\n    -   Orbital angular momentum quantum number for electron 1: $l_1 = 1$ (since it's in a p orbital).\n    -   Orbital angular momentum quantum number for electron 2: $l_2 = 1$ (also in a p orbital).\n    -   Total orbital angular momentum quantum number for the system: $l = 2$.\n    -   The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number: $m = -1$.\n\n2.  **Understand the measurement being performed.**\n    A measurement is made of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The possible results of such a measurement are the eigenvalues of these operators. The state of the system after the measurement would be an eigenstate of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, which is represented in the uncoupled basis as $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>$.\n\n3.  **Identify the target final state.**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    -   The eigenvalue of $L_{z}$ is $m_l \\hbar$.\n    -   For $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$, the magnetic quantum number for electron 1 must be $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    -   For $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$, the magnetic quantum number for electron 2 must be $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    So, the target final state after the measurement is $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n4.  **Relate the initial and final states using the principles of quantum mechanics.**\n    The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\Psi_{initial}>$, to be in a specific final state $|\\Psi_{final}>$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the two states:\n    $P = |\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    In our case:\n    -   $|\\Psi_{initial}> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$\n    -   $|\\Psi_{final}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$\n\n    So we need to calculate $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n5.  **Use conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.**\n    The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The corresponding quantum number relationship is $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\n    -   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with a well-defined eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    -   The final state we are considering, $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$. Its eigenvalue is $(m_{l1} + m_{l2})\\hbar = (-1 + (-1))\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n\n    According to the principles of quantum mechanics, a system in an eigenstate of an operator (like $L_z$) with a specific eigenvalue can only transition to a final state that is also an eigenstate of that same operator if the eigenvalues are the same. Otherwise, the transition probability is zero. This is because eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n\n    Since the initial state has $m=-1$ and the final state has $m_{total} = -2$, the states are orthogonal.\n    $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    The probability is the square of the magnitude of this inner product:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n    This means that it is impossible to measure the system in the state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ if it started in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion.**\n    The joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
