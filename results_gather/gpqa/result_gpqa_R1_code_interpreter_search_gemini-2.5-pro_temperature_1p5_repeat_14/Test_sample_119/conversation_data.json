    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the initial assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere in space.\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars to volume and distance:** The number of stars (`N`) in a given volume (`V`) is `N = ρ * V`. If we consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer, the total number of stars within this distance is:\n    `N(d) = ρ * (4/3) * π * d^3`\n\n3.  **Find the number of stars in a thin shell:** We are interested in how the number of stars changes with a property (parallax), so we should look at a differential quantity. Let's find the number of stars (`dN`) in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    The volume of this shell (`dV`) is the surface area of the sphere times its thickness: `dV = 4 * π * d^2 * dd`.\n    Therefore, the number of stars in this shell is:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4 * π * d^2 * dd`\n\n4.  **Introduce Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`plx`), not distance. Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds):\n    `plx = 1 / d`  or `d = 1 / plx`\n\n5.  **Connect the differentials:** We need to relate the differential of distance (`dd`) to the differential of parallax (`d(plx)`). We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1 / plx] = -1 / plx^2`\n    The negative sign simply means that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For number counts, we are interested in the magnitude of the relationship:\n    `|dd| = (1 / plx^2) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Substitute to find the final relationship:** Now we can substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d^2 * dd`\n    Substitute `d = 1/plx`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)^2 * dd`\n    Substitute `dd = (1/plx^2) * d(plx)` (using the magnitude):\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4 * π * ρ / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the number of stars per unit parallax:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the last equation:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4 * π * ρ / plx^4`\n\n8.  **Determine the proportionality:** Since `4`, `π`, and the stellar density `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^4`\n\nThis means that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`. Comparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1/plx^3\nB) ~ 1/plx^4\nC) ~ 1/plx^2\nD) ~ 1/plx^1\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
