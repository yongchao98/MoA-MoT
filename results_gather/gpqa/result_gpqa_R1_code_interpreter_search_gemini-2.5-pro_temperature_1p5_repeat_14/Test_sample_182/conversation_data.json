    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\nLet's break down its structure to understand the functional groups and degrees of unsaturation present:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. This contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO). This also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group. This contains another carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nTo calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant, we count the number of rings and pi (π) bonds:\n*   1 ring = 1 IHD\n*   1 C=C in the cyclohexene ring = 1 IHD\n*   1 C=C in the vinyl group = 1 IHD\n*   1 C=O in the carboxylic acid group = 1 IHD\n*   1 C=O in the formyl (aldehyde) group = 1 IHD\n**Total IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.**\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula and use the IHD formula.\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (in ring) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 2 (in vinyl) = 10 carbons (C₁₀).\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** Let's count them on the structure:\n    *   C1 (with COOH): 1H\n    *   C2 (with CHO): 1H\n    *   C3 (double bond): 1H\n    *   C4 (double bond): 1H\n    *   C5 (with vinyl): 1H\n    *   C6: 2H\n    *   -COOH: 1H\n    *   -CHO: 1H\n    *   -CH=CH₂: 3H\n    *   Total H = 1+1+1+1+1+2 + 1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens (H₁₂).\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) = 3 oxygens (O₃).\n*   **Reactant Molecular Formula:** C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nUsing the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\nThis confirms the IHD of the reactant is 5.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**.\nThis is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. Its function is to perform a complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and to saturate multiple bonds.\n\nThe following transformations will occur:\n1.  **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n2.  **Aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n3.  **Alkene (C=C)** bonds are reduced (hydrogenated) to alkane (C-C) single bonds.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product\nApplying the transformations from Step 2 to our reactant:\n*   The cyclohex-3-ene ring becomes a **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The carboxylic acid group at C1 is replaced by a **methyl group**.\n*   The formyl group at C2 is replaced by a **methyl group**.\n*   The vinyl group at C5 is saturated to become an **ethyl group**.\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane: **5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\nThis is a saturated cycloalkane. Let's find its molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** The number of carbons does not change during this reduction. The product still has 10 carbons (C₁₀).\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** The product is a saturated cycloalkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. For n=10, the formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** All oxygen atoms are removed during the reduction.\n*   **Product Molecular Formula:** C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe IHD represents the number of rings and/or π bonds in a molecule.\n\n**Method 1: Using the product structure**\n*   The product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, has one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   It has no double or triple bonds (no π bonds).\n*   Therefore, IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**Method 2: Using the product's molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀)**\n*   IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n*   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\n*   IHD = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1. This single degree of unsaturation corresponds to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 5\nD) 3\n\nThe calculated IHD is 1, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
