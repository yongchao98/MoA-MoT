    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzene ring:** The core structure.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Relative positions (substitution pattern):**\n    *   The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   The tert-butyl and nitro groups are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   The ethoxy and nitro groups are *meta* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern requires careful control of the regiochemistry during the synthesis.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added is critical, as existing groups on the ring direct new incoming groups.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho-, para-director. It's very bulky, which can sterically hinder substitution at the ortho position.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director. In strong acid, it becomes the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step by step. A common synthetic strategy involves converting a nitro group into an amine, then a diazonium salt, which can then be converted into a hydroxyl group (-OH) and subsequently an ether (-OEt). This sequence (`-NO2 -> -NH2 -> -N2+ -> -OH -> -OEt`) is present in some form in all options. The key is to assemble the other groups correctly around this functional group transformation.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   Step (i) makes tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Step (ii) nitrates it.\n    *   Step (iii) sulfonates the result.\n    *   Step (iv) calls for `NaNO2/HCl`, which is used for diazotization of an primary aromatic amine (-NH2). At step (iii), the molecule is `nitro-tert-butyl-benzenesulfonic acid`. There is no amine group present. Therefore, this sequence is impossible as written. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Step (i) makes nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) performs a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. The strongly activating -NH2 group directs the incoming tert-butyl group primarily to the *para* position, yielding `4-tert-butylaniline`.\n    *   The subsequent steps would build upon a 1,4-disubstituted ring. It is not possible to achieve the required 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern from this intermediate. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence uses a sulfonic acid group as a blocking group.\n    *   i) -> tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (the bulky t-Bu group directs the -SO3H to the para position).\n    *   iii) -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (the t-Bu and -SO3H groups both direct the nitro group to position 2).\n    *   iv) -> 4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   This sequence successfully creates an ortho relationship between an amino group (the future -OEt) and the t-Bu group. However, the final product requires the nitro group to be ortho to the t-Bu group as well. Step (vi) is a second nitration, which is highly unlikely on such a substituted ring, and other subsequent steps don't lead to the correct final structure. If we try to convert the amino group to the ethoxy group and keep the nitro group from step iii, we would end up with a 1,2,4-substituted product, not the desired 1,2,3-product. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   **i) t-BuCl/AlCl3:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. To get the required 1,2,3-pattern, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer, **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. High-yield synthesis often involves isomer separation.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group gives **2-tert-butylaniline**. We now have the t-Bu and the future OEt group precursor (-NH2) ortho to each other, which is correct for the final product (t-Bu at C2, OEt at C1).\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial and most complex step. Under these strong acid conditions, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-Bu group is an o,p-director. The desired product requires nitration at position 3. While analysis of directing effects suggests other positions might be favored, this is the only path among the options that can lead to the correct substitution pattern. For this sequence to work, we must assume that nitration occurs at the 3-position, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amine group of `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline` is converted to a diazonium salt (`-NH2 -> -N2+`).\n    *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol (`-N2+ -> -OH`), yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis (`-OH -> -OEt`), yielding the final target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   Steps (i) through (vii) represent a coherent, albeit challenging, synthesis of the target molecule. The final two steps listed in option C, `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4`, are redundant as they would sulfonate and then immediately desulfonate the final product. This is likely an error in the question's construction. However, the core of the synthesis (i-vii) is the only one among the choices that produces the correct molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, Sequence C is the only one that provides a plausible (though non-trivial) route to the desired 1,2,3-substituted product skeleton. The other options fail due to impossible reactions or incorrect regiochemistry that cannot be rectified. Therefore, Option C is the best answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
