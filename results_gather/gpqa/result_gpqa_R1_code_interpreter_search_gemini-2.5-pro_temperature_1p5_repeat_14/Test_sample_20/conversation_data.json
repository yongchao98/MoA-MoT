    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n    Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen on an sp3 hybridized carbon).\n\n    1.  **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):**\n        *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n        *   The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds.\n        *   These α-carbons are sp2 hybridized and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached that can participate in tautomerization. For tautomerization to occur, an alpha-hydrogen needs to be removed from an sp3 carbon.\n        *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.**\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH2- groups.\n        *   Each carbonyl group is adjacent to two -CH2- groups. These -CH2- groups contain α-hydrogens on sp3 hybridized carbons.\n        *   The presence of these α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It tautomerizes to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and thus very stable compound. The equilibrium strongly favors the aromatic enol form.\n        *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does exhibit tautomerism.**\n\n    *Conclusion for A:* The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n    Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A common feature of a chiral molecule is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   Let's analyze the central carbon atom (carbon-2). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since carbon-2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center.\n        *   The molecule is chiral and will have two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n        *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.**\n\n    2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   This is an alkene with the formula CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 (trans configuration).\n        *   The molecule is planar around the carbon-carbon double bond. It has no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. A molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral.\n        *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism.**\n\n    *Conclusion for B:* The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination:**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
