    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **The Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n        *   ¹H NMR of the anhydride: a single peak at 7 ppm.\n        *   ¹³C NMR of the anhydride: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride.\n        *   Let's check if the NMR data for maleic anhydride matches the description. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry.\n            *   **¹H NMR:** The two vinylic protons are chemically equivalent. They would show up as a single peak. Protons on a double bond next to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups are expected to be significantly downfield, so a shift of 7 ppm is very reasonable.\n            *   **¹³C NMR:** There are two types of carbons: the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C). This would result in two peaks. Carbonyl carbons typically resonate around 160-180 ppm (165 ppm fits). Alkene carbons resonate around 100-150 ppm (137 ppm fits).\n        *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃)**.\n\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 carbon is a CH₂ group.\n        *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition**, a [4+2] reaction between a diene and a dienophile.\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). The molecular formula provided for the products matches the expected sum.\n    *   The reaction yields a major and a minor product. In Diels-Alder reactions, this typically corresponds to the formation of **endo** and **exo** diastereomers. The major product is usually the kinetically favored *endo* adduct, while the minor product is the thermodynamically favored *exo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Products**\n    *   The reaction between a cyclic diene (cyclopentadiene derivative) and a dienophile produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton.\n    *   In our case, the product is **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2=C3 bond, the C5-C6 bond, and passes through the C7 atom.\n    *   **Protons in the product:**\n        *   Two bridgehead methyl groups (at C1 and C4). They are equivalent by symmetry. This gives a **6H singlet**.\n        *   Two vinylic methyl groups (at C2 and C3). They are also equivalent by symmetry. This gives a **6H singlet**.\n        *   Two protons on the anhydride part (at C5 and C6). They are equivalent by symmetry and not coupled to any other protons. This gives a **2H singlet**.\n        *   Two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C=C double bond, one is *anti*). They are geminally coupled to each other, so they will appear as a pair of doublets (an AB system or, if the coupling constant is small compared to the chemical shift difference, an AX system). The problem refers to one of them as a **1H doublet**.\n\n4.  **Assign the NMR Signals**\n    *   We need to assign the given chemical shifts to the proton signals we've identified.\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups are downfield. This signal corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring (H5 and H6).\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Vinylic methyl groups (protons on a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond) typically resonate around 1.6-2.5 ppm. This signal corresponds to the methyl groups at C2 and C3.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Methyl groups on a saturated, tertiary carbon (like a bridgehead) resonate further upfield, typically 0.8-1.5 ppm. This signal corresponds to the methyl groups at C1 and C4.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This corresponds to one of the C7 bridge protons.\n\n5.  **Interpret the NOESY Data**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that is unique to the major (endo) isomer.\n    *   **Endo vs. Exo Stereochemistry:**\n        *   In the **endo** adduct (the major product), the anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the C=C double bond of the bicyclic system due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions during the transition state. This places the anhydride protons (H5, H6) close to the vinylic substituents (the methyl groups at C2, C3).\n        *   In the **exo** adduct (the minor product), the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C=C double bond. The anhydride protons (H5, H6) are far from the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion from NOESY:** The NOESY cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl groups**.\n\n6.  **Match the Finding to the Options**\n    *   We identified the key NOE as being between:\n        *   The anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   The vinylic methyl protons: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This corresponds directly to option D.\n\n    *   Let's review the other options to confirm:\n        *   A) 6H singlet (~1 ppm) and 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm): Bridgehead methyls and a C7 proton. This proximity might exist in both isomers.\n        *   B) 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm) and 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm): A C7 proton and the anhydride protons. This proximity is expected in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product.\n        *   C) 6H singlet (~1 ppm) and 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm): Bridgehead methyls and vinylic methyls. The distance is fixed by the rigid bicyclic frame and would be the same in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the only option that describes a NOESY cross-peak characteristic of the major (endo) adduct is the one connecting the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<D>>>"
