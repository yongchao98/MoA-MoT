    "This problem is governed by the time-energy uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics.\n\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The time-energy form of the uncertainty principle states that the uncertainty in a state's energy ($\\Delta E$) and the lifetime of the state ($\\Delta t$) are related by the inequality:\n    $\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can approximate this as $\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta t}$. This $\\Delta E$ represents the \"natural linewidth\" or the inherent spread in the energy of the quantum state.\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:** We need to find the energy spread ($\\Delta E$) for each of the two states given their lifetimes ($\\Delta t$). The value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV路s is $\\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV路s.\n\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime, $\\Delta t_1 = 10^{-9}$ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta t_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV路s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime, $\\Delta t_2 = 10^{-8}$ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta t_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV路s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV\n\n3.  **Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the difference between their central energies, $|E_1 - E_2|$, must be significantly larger than their energy uncertainties. A common criterion (similar to the Rayleigh criterion in optics) is that the energy separation must be at least as large as the sum of the individual energy widths.\n    $|E_1 - E_2| > \\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2$\n\n    Let's calculate this minimum required separation:\n    $|E_1 - E_2| > (6.582 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}) + (6.582 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ eV})$\n    $|E_1 - E_2| > (6.582 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}) + (0.6582 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV})$\n    $|E_1 - E_2| > 7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n\n    Even using a less strict criterion, where the separation must simply be larger than the largest of the two uncertainties (which is $\\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV), we reach a similar conclusion. The uncertainty is dominated by the state with the shorter lifetime.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options:** We need to find an option for the energy difference, $|E_1 - E_2|$, that is greater than our calculated minimum of ~$7 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n    *   A) $10^{-11}$ eV is much smaller than $7 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   B) $10^{-9}$ eV is smaller than $7 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   C) $10^{-8}$ eV is smaller than $7 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   D) $10^{-4}$ eV is much larger than $7 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n    Only the energy difference in option D is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<D>>>"
