    "This problem requires an understanding of the selectivity of different reducing agents and the stereochemical outcomes of the reactions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the product and starting materials**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). It has a single stereocenter at the 4-position, where the ethyl group is attached.\n*   **Starting Materials (A and B):** The options provided are all stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, where one carboxylic acid group is free (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu). It has a single stereocenter at the 3-position, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\nThe structure of the starting material is:\nHOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will *not* reduce the -COOH group but *will* reduce the -COOiBu group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester at C-5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid at C-1 remains unchanged.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  ---(LiBH₄)-->  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) where the hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not involve breaking any bonds at the C-3 stereocenter. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration of the starting material at C-3 is retained in the final product at C-4.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is also a reducing agent. It is known for its ability to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. It will *not* reduce the -COOiBu group but *will* reduce the -COOH group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid at C-1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester at C-5 remains unchanged.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  ---(BH₃)-->  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the same six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reaction sequence does not affect the stereocenter at C-3. The configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results and choose the correct option**\n\n*   From our analysis, starting material A must be the (R)-isomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the (S)-isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to the following choice:\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) A = (S)... , B = (S)...\nB) A = (R)... , B = (S)...\nC) A = (R)... , B = (R)...\nD) A = (S)... , B = (R)...\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
