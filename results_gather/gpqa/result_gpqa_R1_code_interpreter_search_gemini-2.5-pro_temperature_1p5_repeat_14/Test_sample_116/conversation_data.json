    "**1. Understanding Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. For a compound to exhibit optical isomerism, it must be **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are:\n*   **A chiral center (or stereocenter):** Typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Axial chirality:** Found in molecules that lack a chiral center but have an axis of chirality, such as certain allenes, spiranes, and atropisomers (like hindered biphenyls).\n*   **Planar chirality:** Found in molecules like certain cyclophanes.\n\nA molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is **achiral** and will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2. Analyzing Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are linked by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** The positions ortho to the bond connecting the rings (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large, bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n    *   These bulky groups prevent the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This restricted rotation forces the rings into a fixed, non-planar arrangement.\n    *   In this twisted conformation, the molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, which is a type of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is also known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine carbon-2 (the carbon atom bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since carbon-2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and thus it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbonyl carbon is only bonded to three atoms (one oxygen and two carbons) and cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate: CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond. It also has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary**\n*   Compound 1: Chiral (atropisomerism) -> Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2: Chiral (chiral center) -> Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3: Achiral (plane of symmetry) -> Does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4: Achiral (center of inversion) -> Does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
