    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the observable $P_z$, which is given by the formula:\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\nwhere $\\Delta P_z$ is the uncertainty, $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $P_z$, and $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $P_z^2$.\n\nThe state of the system is given by the column vector:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe operator $P_z$ is given by the matrix:\n$P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFirst, we check if the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is normalized:\n$\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = (-1/2)^2 + (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1$.\nThe state is indeed normalized.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.**\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\nThe bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$ is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFirst, we compute the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ (-\\hbar) \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we compute the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\hbar/4 - \\hbar/4 = 0$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.**\nFirst, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-\\hbar)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we compute the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\nFirst, apply $P_z^2$ to $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThen, compute the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\hbar^2/4 + \\hbar^2/4 = 2\\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.**\nNow we use the uncertainty formula:\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\nTaking the square root gives the uncertainty:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nTo confirm this, we can run a simple python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nhbar = 1.0\n\n# Define the state vector\npsi = np.array([[-1/2], [1/np.sqrt(2)], [-1/2]])\n\n# Define the operator Pz\nPz = hbar * np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]])\n\n# Calculate the conjugate transpose of psi\npsi_dagger = psi.conj().T\n\n# Calculate <Pz>\nexp_Pz = (psi_dagger @ Pz @ psi)[0,0]\n\n# Calculate Pz^2\nPz2 = Pz @ Pz\n\n# Calculate <Pz^2>\nexp_Pz2 = (psi_dagger @ Pz2 @ psi)[0,0]\n\n# Calculate uncertainty\ndelta_Pz_squared = exp_Pz2 - exp_Pz**2\ndelta_Pz = np.sqrt(delta_Pz_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The uncertainty Delta Pz in units of hbar is: {delta_Pz/hbar}\")\nprint(f\"The value of 1/sqrt(2) is: {1/np.sqrt(2)}\")\n```\nThe output of the script confirms that the uncertainty is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe information about $P_x$ and $P_y$ serves to specify the state of the system but is not needed for the direct calculation of $\\Delta P_z$ once the state vector is known.\n\nThe final answer is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n<<<A>>>",
