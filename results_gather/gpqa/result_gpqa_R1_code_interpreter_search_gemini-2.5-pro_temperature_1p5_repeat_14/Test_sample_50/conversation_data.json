    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical System and Method\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed near a grounded conducting sphere. A \"grounded\" sphere has its potential fixed at zero (V=0). The charge `q` induces an opposite charge on the surface of the sphere. Calculating the potential energy directly from this induced charge distribution is difficult.\n\nThe standard and most elegant way to solve this problem is using the **method of images**. This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the boundary condition (V=0 on the sphere's surface) is satisfied. For an observer outside the sphere, the electric field and potential due to the sphere's induced charges are identical to the field and potential created by the image charge.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)\nLet the center of the sphere of radius `R` be at the origin. The point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center (let's say on the z-axis, at z=d).\n\nThe image charge `q'` is placed at a distance `b` from the center along the same axis. For the potential on the surface of the sphere (where the distance from the origin is `r=R`) to be zero, the position and magnitude of the image charge must be:\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nThis is a standard result from electrostatics. With the original charge `q` and this image charge `q'`, the potential at `r=R` is zero, satisfying the condition for a grounded sphere.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is stored as potential energy in the electric field.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n#### Method A: Integrating the Force\nThe force on the real charge `q` is due to the electric field of the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is identical to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nLet's calculate the force on `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center (`x > R`). At this point, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at a position `b(x) = R^2/x`. The force is the Coulomb force between `q` and `q'(x)`:\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n*   Force `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2`\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R*x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\nThe negative sign indicates the force is attractive.\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external force to bring the charge from infinity to `d`, which is the negative of the work done by the electrostatic field:\n`U = W_ext = - integral(∞ to d) [F(x) dx]`\n`U = - integral(∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R*x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * integral(∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\nThe integral becomes `integral(1/(2u^2) du) = -1/(2u) = -1/(2(x^2 - R^2))`.\n\nNow, evaluating the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [-1/(2(x^2 - R^2))]` from `∞` to `d`.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1/(2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1/(2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [-1/(2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method B: Using the Potential Energy Formula\nThe potential energy `U` of a system of charges and conductors can be expressed as `U = (1/2) * Σ(q_i * V_i)`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\nIn our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere (whose potential `V_sphere` is 0).\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced + (1/2) * Q_induced * V_sphere`\nSince `V_sphere = 0`, the second term vanishes.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n`V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charge on the sphere. By the method of images, this is equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n*   `q' = -qR/d`\n*   Distance from image charge (at `b = R^2/d`) to the point `d` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n*   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system.\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) U = - k*q^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nC) U = - (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated expression matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
