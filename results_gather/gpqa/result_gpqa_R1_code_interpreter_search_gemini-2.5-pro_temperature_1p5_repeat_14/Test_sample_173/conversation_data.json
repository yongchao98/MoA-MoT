    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A single nucleus with mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Since it's at rest, its initial total momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n    *   Its initial total energy is `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Fragment 1 is the \"more massive fragment\". The problem states it is \"2 times more massive than the other\", which we interpret as `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the fragments' rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments will have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses `m1` and `m2`:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, let's find their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV` (More massive fragment)\n*   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV` (Less massive fragment)\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nEnergy must be conserved. The initial energy `Mc^2` is converted into the rest-mass energy of the fragments plus their kinetic energy.\n`E_initial = E_final`\n`Mc^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n`Mc^2 = (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) + (T1 + T2)`\n\nThe total kinetic energy `Q = T1 + T2` is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies:\n`Q = Mc^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation of Momentum\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest (`P_initial = 0`), the total final momentum must also be zero.\n`P_final = p1 + p2 = 0`\nThis means the fragments fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude:\n`|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\n### 5. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSince the momenta are equal:\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nWe can find the ratio of their kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\nSince `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### 6. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest mass `m` is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\nAlso, total energy `E` is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: `E = T + mc^2`.\nSubstituting `E` into the relation:\n`(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`\n`T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2) + (mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`\n`(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`\n\nSince `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`. Let's apply the formula to both fragments:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nNow, substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m1*c^2 = 198`, `m2*c^2 = 99`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * 198 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * 99`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\nCombine terms on the right side:\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\nSubtract `T1^2` from both sides:\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\nMove the `T1` term to the left:\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nThe correct (relativistic) kinetic energy is `T1 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 7. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct `T1` and the `T1` from the classical approximation.\nDifference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\nDifference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\nTo verify the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# All energy units are in GeV\n\n# Given values\nMc2 = 300.0\nm1c2 = 198.0\nm2c2 = 99.0\n\n# Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2) # Should be 3.0 GeV\n\n# --- Classical Calculation ---\n# T1_cl + T2_cl = Q\n# T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = 99/198 = 1/2  => T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl\n# T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = Q => 3 * T1_cl = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation ---\n# Solves T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = (Q-T1)^2 + 2*(Q-T1)*m2c2\n# Rearranges to T1 * (2*m1c2 + 2*m2c2 + 2*Q) = Q^2 + 2*Q*m2c2\n# Which simplifies to T1 * (2*Mc2) = Q * (Q + 2*m2c2)\nT1_relativistic = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2)) / (2 * Mc2)\n\n# --- Difference ---\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic - T1_classical) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\nClassical T1: 1.0000 GeV\nRelativistic T1: 1.0050 GeV\nDifference: 5.00 MeV\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus with rest-mass energy `Mc^2 = 300 GeV` is initially at rest. It fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n\n**1. Determine the rest masses of the fragments:**\n*   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n    `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`):\n    `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\nThe initial energy is the rest-mass energy of the original nucleus, `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\nThe final energy is the sum of the rest-mass energies and kinetic energies of the two fragments, `E_final = m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 + T1 + T2`.\nBy conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`.\nThe total kinetic energy `Q` is `T1 + T2`, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies:\n`Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes:\n`|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33*M) / (0.66*M) = 1/2`.\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy `Q = T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`:\n`T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1:**\nThe relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\nAlso, total energy `E` equals rest-mass energy plus kinetic energy `T`: `E = T + mc^2`.\nTherefore, `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`.\n\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), we can set `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n\nWe know:\n*   `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation (all in GeV):\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nCancel `T1^2` from both sides:\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference:**\nThe difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value:\nDifference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\nDifference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
