    "**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to get an initial idea of the structure.\n*   The formula for DBE is: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)`\n    *   Where C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, N = number of nitrogens.\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional degree of unsaturation, which is likely a double bond (e.g., C=O) or another ring.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp peaks in the N-H stretching region is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2 group). A primary amine has two N-H bonds, leading to two vibrational modes (symmetric and asymmetric stretching).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is too high for a simple ketone or an amide but is in the typical range for an ester, specifically a conjugated ester (an ester attached to a double bond or aromatic ring). The conjugation lowers the frequency from a typical saturated ester (~1740 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester (-COO-R) group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The triplet splitting (n+1=3) means it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n=2), likely a methylene (-CH2-) group. This suggests an ethyl group fragment (-CH2-CH3).\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The quartet splitting (n+1=4) means it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n=3), which must be the methyl group seen at 1.20 ppm.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a significant downfield shift for a CH2 group. It is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH2-CH3).\n    *   **Combined evidence:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethoxy group (-O-CH2-CH3) that is part of an ester.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** This is highly characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to nitrogen's quadrupolar moment and proton exchange. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** These are four protons in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (two doublets):** This clean \"doublet of doublets\" pattern is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are equivalent and are split by the two protons on the other side.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** The presence of two distinct signals means the two substituents on the ring are different. The downfield signal (8.0 ppm) is next to a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG), while the upfield signal (7.0 ppm) is next to an electron-donating group (EDG).\n        *   The ester group (-COOEt) is an EWG.\n        *   The amino group (-NH2) is an EDG.\n        *   This confirms that the -NH2 and -COOEt groups are attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\n1.  We have a benzene ring with two substituents at the 1 and 4 (para) positions.\n2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n3.  The structure is therefore ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly. It has a C9H11NO2 formula, a para-substituted ring, a primary amine, and an ethyl ester group.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer where the ester oxygen is attached to the ring. This would give a CH2 quartet at a much lower chemical shift (~2.5 ppm).\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester. The IR C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1670 cm⁻¹), and it would be a secondary amide (one N-H peak in IR). The NMR would show a formyl proton (H-C=O) singlet around 8.2 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, not an ester (wrong IR). It is also meta-substituted, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
