    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f(r)`.\n*   The vector field is given by its magnitude `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`.\n*   The direction of the field is radial, so in spherical coordinates, we can write the vector field as `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   The volume of integration `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n*   The integral to evaluate is `∫_V (∇ . f) dV`.\n\n**2. Choose the Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume.\n\nMathematically:\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n\nHere, `V` is the sphere of radius `R`, and `S` is its surface.\n\n**Important Note on the Singularity:** The vector field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat` is undefined (singular) at the origin `r=0`. Strictly speaking, the Divergence Theorem requires the vector field to be well-behaved everywhere inside the volume. However, the theorem can be applied by considering the surface integral, which effectively calculates the contribution from the source at the origin. This is a standard technique in physics and mathematics (e.g., Gauss's Law for a point charge).\n\n**3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n\nWe need to evaluate the surface integral `∮_S (f . dS)`.\n\n*   **The surface S:** This is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n*   **The vector field f on the surface:** On the surface `S`, `r=R`, so the field is `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **The differential surface area vector dS:** For a sphere, the differential area element is a small patch on the surface. Its vector `dS` points in the direction of the outward normal. For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward normal direction is simply the radial direction, `r_hat`. The magnitude of this area element in spherical coordinates is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n    Therefore, the vector is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Dot Product (f . dS)**\n\nNow, we compute the dot product of the field `f` and the surface element `dS`:\n\n`f . dS = ( (1/R^2) * r_hat ) . ( (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat )`\n\nSince `r_hat . r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n\n`f . dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ)`\n`f . dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNotice that the `R^2` terms cancel out. This is a key feature of `1/r^2` fields.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nNow we integrate the result over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere in spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f . dS) = ∫_φ=0 to 2π ∫_θ=0 to π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nFirst, integrate with respect to `θ`:\n`∫_0 to π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π`\n`= -cos(π) - (-cos(0))`\n`= -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nNext, integrate this result with respect to `φ`:\n`∫_φ=0 to 2π (2) dφ = 2 * [φ]_0^2π`\n`= 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the original volume integral is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS) = 4π`\n\nThe result is `4π`, which is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0`, so that the singularity at the origin is enclosed).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 4 π\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
