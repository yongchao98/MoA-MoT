    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n`T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio:**\nWe need to calculate the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n`T_eq1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)`\n`T_eq2 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)`\n\nBy dividing the first equation by the second, we get:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]`\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and cancel out. It also states that both planets have the same albedo, so `A_1 = A_2`, and the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term also cancels out.\n\nThe formula simplifies to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a_1)) * ((2 * a_2) / R_star))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\nThis means the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data:**\nThe radial velocity method gives us the Doppler shift (Δλ), which is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (the semi-amplitude, K) by `K = (Δλ_max / λ) * c`. Since λ and c are constants, `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ_max`.\nSo, `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's maximum radial velocity K is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and semi-major axis (a) by the following formula (assuming M_p << M_star):\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p`\nwhere `v_p` is the planet's orbital velocity, given by `v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)`.\nSubstituting `v_p`:\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (M_p * sqrt(G)) / sqrt(M_star * a)`\n\n*Note: This formula assumes the orbital inclination `i` is 90 degrees (sin(i)=1). This is a reasonable assumption because the problem states the planets were detected by the *transit* method, which requires an edge-on or nearly edge-on orbit.*\n\n**5. Solve for the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1):**\nLet's rearrange the formula for `K` to solve for `a`:\n`K^2 = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)`\n`a = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`. Since G and `M_star` are constants for both planets, they will cancel out:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (M_star * K_1^2)]`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n\n**6. Substitute the Ratio of 'a' into the Temperature Ratio Equation:**\nWe found earlier that `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`.\nSubstituting our expression for `a_2 / a_1`:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K_1 / K_2)`\n\n**7. Calculate the Numerical Value:**\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Mass ratio: `M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5/7`\n*   RV semi-amplitude ratio: `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4`\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5/7) * (3/4) = 15/28`\n\nLet's compute the final value.\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\n# Planet masses in Earth mass units\nmass_planet1 = 7\nmass_planet2 = 5\n\n# Doppler shifts in Angstroms\ndoppler_shift_planet1 = 0.03\ndoppler_shift_planet2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1/T_eq2 can be derived as:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K_1 / K_2)\n# where K is the RV semi-amplitude, and K is proportional to the Doppler shift.\n# So, K_1 / K_2 = doppler_shift_planet1 / doppler_shift_planet2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of masses\nmass_ratio = mass_planet2 / mass_planet1\n\n# Calculate the ratio of RV semi-amplitudes\nK_ratio = doppler_shift_planet1 / doppler_shift_planet2\n\n# Calculate the final temperature ratio\ntemperature_ratio = mass_ratio * K_ratio\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
