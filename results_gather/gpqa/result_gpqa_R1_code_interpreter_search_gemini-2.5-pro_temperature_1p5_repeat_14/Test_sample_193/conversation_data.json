    "To find the partition function Z for the given system, we need to sum the Boltzmann factor, `exp(-βE)`, over all possible microstates of the system.\nThe system consists of three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each spin can be either +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2^3 = 8 possible microstates.\n\nThe energy of a given state is described by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J [ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\nwhere β = 1/(kT).\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as:\nZ = Σ_states exp(-βE)\n\nLet's list all 8 possible microstates, calculate the energy for each, and then sum the corresponding Boltzmann factors.\n\nThe possible configurations for (S1, S2, S3) are:\n1.  **All spins are aligned (all up or all down):**\n    *   State 1: (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n        E₁ = -J [(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   State 2: (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n        E₂ = -J [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    There are **2** states with energy **E = -3J**.\n\n2.  **Two spins are up (+1) and one spin is down (-1):**\n    *   State 3: (+1, +1, -1) -> E₃ = -J [(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J\n    *   State 4: (+1, -1, +1) -> E₄ = -J [(1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J [-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J\n    *   State 5: (-1, +1, +1) -> E₅ = -J [(-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = +J\n    There are **3** such states.\n\n3.  **One spin is up (+1) and two spins are down (-1):**\n    *   State 6: (+1, -1, -1) -> E₆ = -J [(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = +J\n    *   State 7: (-1, +1, -1) -> E₇ = -J [(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J [-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J\n    *   State 8: (-1, -1, +1) -> E₈ = -J [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J\n    There are **3** such states.\n\nFrom this analysis, we find two distinct energy levels and their degeneracies (number of states with that energy):\n*   Energy E₁ = -3J has a degeneracy g₁ = 2.\n*   Energy E₂ = +J has a degeneracy g₂ = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nThe partition function Z can now be calculated by summing over the energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g₁ * exp(-βE₁) + g₂ * exp(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * (+J))\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
