    "This question asks us to compare the densities of four different exoplanets. Density is defined as mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius. Therefore, density is heavily dependent on both the planet's mass and its radius.\n\nLet's analyze each option based on the principles of planetary science:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline, essentially a planet identical to Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's denote this density as ρ_E.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given directly as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to Earth's density (ρ_E).\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** A fundamental concept in planetary structure is that as a planet's mass increases, its self-gravity also increases. This stronger gravitational force compresses the material of the planet, making it denser. Therefore, a planet with the same composition as Earth but significantly more massive will be compressed to a much higher density. Its density will be substantially greater than Earth's (ρ > ρ_E).\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Following the same logic as in option (c), a planet with less mass will have weaker self-gravity. This results in less compression of its constituent materials. Consequently, its average density will be lower than Earth's density (ρ < ρ_E).\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   Planet (a): Density ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Planet (b): Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Planet (c): Density > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to significant gravitational compression)\n*   Planet (d): Density < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to less gravitational compression)\n\nBy comparing these values, it's clear that the planet described in option (c) will have the highest density. The increased mass leads to greater gravitational compression, squeezing the same \"stuff\" into a proportionally smaller volume than would be expected otherwise, thus increasing its overall density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
