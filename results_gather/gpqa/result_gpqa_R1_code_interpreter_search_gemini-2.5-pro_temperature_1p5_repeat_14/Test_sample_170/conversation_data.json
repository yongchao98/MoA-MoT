    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nThe regioselectivity of electrophilic aromatic substitution (where the bromine atom will attach) is determined by the nature of the substituent already present on the benzene ring. We can classify the substituents into two main categories:\n*   **Ortho,para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the position meta to themselves.\n\nLet's classify the substituents for each substance:\n1.  **ะก6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH3) is an alkyl group. It is an activating, **ortho,para-director**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC2H5) is a deactivating, **meta-director**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a halogen. It is a deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO2) is a strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is an alkyl group. It is an activating, **ortho,para-director**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a deactivating, **meta-director**.\n\n**Step 2: Group the substances based on directing effect.**\nSubstances that are meta-directors will form a very small amount of the para-isomer. Substances that are ortho,para-directors will form a significant amount of the para-isomer. Therefore, the substances in the first group will have a lower para-isomer yield than the substances in the second group.\n\n*   **Group 1 (Low para-yield):** Meta-directors {4 (-NO2), 6 (-COOH), 2 (-COOC2H5)}\n*   **Group 2 (High para-yield):** Ortho,para-directors {1 (-CH3), 5 (-C2H5), 3 (-Cl)}\n\nSo, the final order will look like: (Order of Group 1) < (Order of Group 2).\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances within Group 1 (Meta-directors).**\nThe substances are 4 (nitrobenzene), 6 (benzoic acid), and 2 (ethyl benzoate). For these meta-directors, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of the non-meta isomers (ortho and para) is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro is one of the strongest deactivating groups. Carboxylic acid is stronger than its corresponding ester because the alkyl group in the ester is slightly electron-donating).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\nC6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances within Group 2 (Ortho,para-directors).**\nThe substances are 1 (toluene), 5 (ethylbenzene), and 3 (chlorobenzene). For these ortho,para-directors, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product.\n*   **Steric Hindrance (Comparing 1 and 5):** The incoming electrophile (Br+) is bulky. The ethyl group (-C2H5) in substance 5 is larger than the methyl group (-CH3) in substance 1. This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions of ethylbenzene makes the para position relatively more accessible. Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)\n*   **Electronic Effects (Comparing with 3):** The chlorine atom in substance 3 is o,p-directing due to its ability to donate a lone pair of electrons through resonance. However, it is also strongly electron-withdrawing by induction (-I effect). This inductive effect is strongest at the ortho positions and weaker at the more distant para position. This deactivation of the ortho positions, combined with steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for substitution at the para position. Chlorobenzene typically yields a very high percentage (~87%) of the para-isomer upon bromination, which is generally higher than that for alkylbenzenes like toluene or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Order: Alkylbenzenes (1, 5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\n\nCombining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for Group 2 is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\n\n**Step 5: Combine the orders of both groups.**\nCombining the orders from Step 3 and Step 4:\n(Order of Group 1) < (Order of Group 2)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
