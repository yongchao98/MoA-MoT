    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physical System:**\n    The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape\" with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. This system radiates electromagnetic waves. We need to find the radiated power per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, as a function of the angle `θ` from the z-axis and the wavelength `λ`.\n\n2.  **Model the Radiating Source:**\n    A localized oscillating charge distribution can be analyzed using a multipole expansion. The lowest-order terms are the electric dipole, magnetic dipole, and electric quadrupole.\n    *   **Electric Dipole Model:** The most common and typically dominant form of radiation comes from an oscillating electric dipole. An oscillation of charge along the z-axis creates a time-varying electric dipole moment `p(t)` along the z-axis. This is the simplest and most natural model for the given description. Let's assume this model first.\n    *   **Electric Quadrupole Model:** A more complex oscillation, such as the spheroid changing its shape from prolate to oblate while keeping its center of mass fixed, would have a zero dipole moment. The lowest non-zero radiating moment would be the electric quadrupole. This is a more specialized scenario.\n\n    Given the phrasing, we'll proceed with the electric dipole model, as it is the most fundamental and likely intended interpretation.\n\n3.  **Angular Dependence of Electric Dipole Radiation:**\n    For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` is given by the formula:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `C` is a constant that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment and the frequency, and `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n\n4.  **Find the Maximum Power (A):**\n    The radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (or `π/2` radians).\n    The maximum radiated power `A` is therefore:\n    `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Power at θ = 30°:**\n    Now, we calculate the power radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`:\n    `dP/dΩ (at 30°) = C * sin²(30°)`\n    Since `A = C`, we can write:\n    `dP/dΩ (at 30°) = A * sin²(30°)`\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    So, `dP/dΩ (at 30°) = A * (1/4) = A/4`.\n\n6.  **Determine the Fraction:**\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is:\n    Fraction = `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n7.  **Determine the Wavelength Dependence:**\n    The function `f` also depends on the wavelength `λ`. According to the Larmor formula for electric dipole radiation, the total radiated power `P` is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`.\n    `P ∝ ω⁴`\n    The power per unit solid angle has the same frequency dependence: `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`.\n    The relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πc / λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    Substituting this into the proportionality:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n    So, a possible form for the function `f` includes a `λ⁻⁴` dependence.\n\n8.  **Combine Results and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    *   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    *   The wavelength dependence is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n    Matching these results with the given options:\n    A) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n    B) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n    C) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n    D) 1/4, λ⁻³\n\n    Option B matches our derived results.\n\n*(Self-Correction/Alternative Check: If we had assumed an electric quadrupole model, the angular dependence would be `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` and the wavelength dependence `λ⁻⁶`. This would lead to a fraction of 3/4 and `λ⁻⁶`, corresponding to option A. However, the dipole model is the more standard and general case for a simple oscillating charge distribution.)*\n\nThe most plausible answer based on the standard physical model is given by the dipole approximation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
