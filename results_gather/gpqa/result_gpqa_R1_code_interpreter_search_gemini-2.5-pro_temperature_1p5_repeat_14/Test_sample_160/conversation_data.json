    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We have a scenario in a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM).\n    *   There are two different mean free paths being considered:\n        *   **λ1**: The mean free path of *gas molecules colliding with each other*. This is the standard definition of mean free path in a gas.\n        *   **λ2**: The mean free path of *beam electrons colliding with gas molecules*.\n    *   The conditions are constant: ultra-high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr) and the same temperature.\n    *   The question asks for the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n2.  **Recall the definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    *   The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions.\n    *   A general formula for MFP is:  `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`\n        *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the particles being collided with).\n        *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that a target presents to the projectile for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Apply the formula to λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collision):**\n        *   The projectile is a gas molecule.\n        *   The target is another gas molecule.\n        *   The number density of target molecules is `n`.\n        *   The collision cross-section is for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. Let's call this `σ_gg`. This cross-section is determined by the physical size of the molecules and their short-range intermolecular forces (like van der Waals forces).\n        *   So, `λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gg)`\n\n    *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collision):**\n        *   The projectile is a high-energy electron (1000 kV).\n        *   The target is a gas molecule.\n        *   The number density of target molecules is the *same* `n` as before, because the gas conditions in the chamber haven't changed.\n        *   The collision cross-section is for an electron scattering off a gas molecule. Let's call this `σ_eg`.\n        *   So, `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n\n4.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   To compare λ1 and λ2, we need to compare `σ_gg` and `σ_eg`, since `n` is the same for both.\n    *   The relationship is inverse: if `σ` is larger, `λ` is smaller (more frequent collisions mean shorter travel distance between them).\n    *   So, the core question is: **How does the collision cross-section of a gas-gas collision (`σ_gg`) compare to that of an electron-gas collision (`σ_eg`)?**\n\n5.  **Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (`σ_gg` vs. `σ_eg`):**\n    *   **`σ_gg` (Gas-Gas):** This is a \"hard-sphere-like\" collision between two neutral particles. The interaction is short-ranged. The collision effectively happens only when the molecules get very close to each other, on the order of their physical diameters.\n    *   **`σ_eg` (Electron-Gas):** This is a collision between a charged particle (the electron) and a neutral, but polarizable, particle (the gas molecule). The interaction is governed by the long-range Coulomb force. The electron is deflected by the electric field of the atom's nucleus (which is positive) and its surrounding electron cloud (which is negative).\n    *   Because the Coulomb force is long-range, an electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"scattered\" or \"collided with\") even when it is far from the gas molecule's center. This makes the effective target area presented by the gas molecule to the electron much larger than its physical size.\n    *   Therefore, the electron-gas scattering cross-section is significantly larger than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section.\n    *   Conclusion: `σ_eg > σ_gg`.\n\n6.  **Final Derivation:**\n    *   We established `σ_eg > σ_gg`.\n    *   We have `λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gg)` and `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`.\n    *   Since `σ_eg` is in the denominator for `λ2`, and `σ_eg` is larger than `σ_gg`, the value of `λ2` must be smaller than `λ1`.\n    *   Thus, **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1. The \"1.22\" factor is a distractor, likely from the non-relativistic de Broglie wavelength formula.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: Correct. This matches our physical reasoning.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   D) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. This would imply the collision cross-sections are the same, which is physically untrue for these two different types of interactions.\n\nThe conclusion is that the mean free path for electrons in the residual gas is shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves.\n\n<<<B>>>"
