    "This problem involves two main calculations: the pH at a point in the buffer region of a titration and the pH at the equivalence point.\n\n### **Step 1: Initial Dilution**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid (HAc) after it's diluted with water.\n*   Initial concentration of HAc, M1 = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of HAc, V1 = 20.00 cm3\n*   Final volume, V2 = 20.00 cm3 (HAc) + 20.00 cm3 (water) = 40.00 cm3\n\nUsing the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2:\n*   M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm3) / 40.00 cm3 = 0.025 M\n*   The starting concentration of our acetic acid for the titration is **0.025 M**.\n\n### **Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (Ac-), and 75% of the acetic acid remains. This creates a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\n**pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])**\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10^-5\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.73\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid]:**\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of moles of acetate to moles of acetic acid is 25:75 or 1:3. Since they are in the same volume, the concentration ratio [Ac-]/[HAc] is also 1/3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.25\n\n### **Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-). The solution now contains only sodium acetate. The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic.\n\n**Ac- + H2O ⇌ HAc + OH-**\n\n1.  **Calculate moles of HAc:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.0400 L = 0.0010 moles HAc\n\n2.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:**\n    *   Moles of HAc = Moles of NaOH\n    *   0.0010 moles = 0.1 M × V_NaOH\n    *   V_NaOH = 0.0010 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm3\n\n3.  **Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm3 (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm3 (NaOH) = 50.00 cm3 = 0.050 L\n    *   The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of HAc, which is 0.0010 moles.\n    *   [Ac-] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.0010 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n4.  **Calculate the concentration of OH- from the hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 5.41 x 10^-10\n    *   Set up the equilibrium expression: Kb = [HAc][OH-] / [Ac-]\n    *   Let x = [OH-] = [HAc].\n    *   5.41 x 10^-10 = (x)(x) / (0.02)\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10^-10) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10^-11\n    *   x = [OH-] = √(1.082 x 10^-11) ≈ 3.29 x 10^-6 M\n\n5.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-] = -log(3.29 x 10^-6) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nA precise calculation using a script yields the same results.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\nM_HAc_initial = 0.05\nV_HAc_initial = 0.020 # in L\nV_water = 0.020 # in L\nM_NaOH = 0.1\n\n# Step 1: Dilution\nV_HAc_diluted = V_HAc_initial + V_water\nM_HAc_diluted = (M_HAc_initial * V_HAc_initial) / V_HAc_diluted\n\n# Step 2: pH at 25% Titration\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_at_25 = pKa + math.log10(0.25 / 0.75)\n\n# Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point\n# Moles of HAc\nmoles_HAc = M_HAc_diluted * V_HAc_diluted\n# Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence\nV_NaOH_eq = moles_HAc / M_NaOH\n# Total volume at equivalence\nV_total_eq = V_HAc_diluted + V_NaOH_eq\n# Concentration of acetate at equivalence\nconc_acetate_eq = moles_HAc / V_total_eq\n# Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# [OH-] from hydrolysis (x = sqrt(Kb * [Ac-]))\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate_eq)\n# pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n<<<\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires calculating the pH at two different points during the titration of a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH.\n\n### **Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation:** First, we determine the concentration of the acetic acid (HAc) solution after dilution.\n    *   Initial Molarity of HAc (M₁): 0.05 M\n    *   Initial Volume of HAc (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n    *   Final Volume (V₂): 20.00 cm³ (HAc) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n    *   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂:\n        M₂ = (M₁ × V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M HAc**\n\n2.  **Buffer Region Calculation:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (Ac⁻), by reacting with NaOH. This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (HAc) and its conjugate base (Ac⁻). We can use the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation**:\n    *   pH = pKₐ + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n\n3.  **Calculate pKₐ:**\n    *   Kₐ = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKₐ = -log(Kₐ) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n4.  **Determine the Ratio:** At 25% titration, the amount of conjugate base formed is 25% of the initial acid, and the amount of acid remaining is 75%.\n    *   Ratio = [Ac⁻]/[HAc] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n\n5.  **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ **4.26**\n\n### **Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Equivalence Point Conditions:** At the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaAc). The solution now contains only the conjugate base (Ac⁻), which will hydrolyze water to produce OH⁻, making the solution basic.\n    *   Reaction: Ac⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HAc + OH⁻\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles of Acid:**\n    *   Moles of HAc = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.0010 mol\n\n3.  **Calculate Volume of NaOH Added:** At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equals the initial moles of HAc.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.0010 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n4.  **Calculate Concentration of Acetate ([Ac⁻]):**\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   [Ac⁻] = Moles of Ac⁻ / Total Volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\n5.  **Calculate [OH⁻] from Hydrolysis:** We need the base dissociation constant (Kₑ) for the hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   Kₑ = Kₗ / Kₐ = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis: Kₑ = [HAc][OH⁻] / [Ac⁻]\n    *   Let x = [HAc] = [OH⁻].\n    *   5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n\n6.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 ≈ **8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of 4.26 at 25% titration and a pH of 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
