    "1.  **Goal Analysis:** The objective is to identify a mutation that eliminates an anti-nutritional compound. This is best achieved by inactivating the gene responsible for synthesizing the compound. A gene is inactivated if its protein product is non-functional or not produced at all.\n\n2.  **Mutation Impact Analysis:** We need to evaluate the impact of each mutation on the protein sequence. The most severe mutations are those that lead to a non-functional protein. In order of severity:\n    *   **Nonsense mutations:** Introduce a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated (shortened) and almost always non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift mutations (insertions/deletions not in multiples of 3):** Alter the reading frame of the gene. This changes every amino acid downstream from the mutation and often introduces a premature stop codon. These are also highly likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n    *   **Missense mutations:** Change a single amino acid. This might or might not affect protein function, depending on the importance of that specific amino acid. This is less reliable for knocking out a gene.\n    *   **Silent mutations:** Do not change the amino acid sequence and have no effect on the protein.\n\n3.  **Sequence Examination:** We will analyze each mutant sequence by comparing it to the intact gene. The intact gene starts with `ATG` (Start codon - Methionine) and the first few codons are `ATG TTT CTC...`, which code for `Met-Phe-Leu...`.\n\n    *   **Intact:** `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n        *   Codons: `ATG TTT CTC GCT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met Phe Leu Ala ...`\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n        *   Comparison: The sequence has the same length as the intact gene, implying substitutions.\n          `Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT`\n          `Mutant: ATG TTC TAC GCT`\n        *   Changes: The codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`. Both code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a silent mutation. The codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. While it might affect the protein, it's not guaranteed to inactivate it.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n        *   Comparison: The length is the same, implying substitutions.\n          `Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT`\n          `Mutant: ATG TTC TAA GCT`\n        *   Changes: The codon `TTT` becomes `TTC` (Phe -> Phe, silent). The codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. Translation will halt after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (`Met-Phe`), which will be completely non-functional. This is a highly effective way to knock out a gene.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n        *   Comparison: The mutant sequence before the ellipsis is longer than the intact sequence, indicating an insertion. Aligning the end of the sequences reveals a change at the beginning. This insertion of one or more nucleotides (not a multiple of three) causes a **frameshift mutation**. This scrambles the entire downstream amino acid sequence and usually leads to a premature stop codon. This is also a very effective knockout mutation.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n        *   Comparison: The mutant sequence before the ellipsis is shorter than the intact sequence, indicating a deletion. This deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three also causes a **frameshift mutation**, with similar consequences to Mutant 3.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** We are looking for the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the compound.\n    *   Mutant 1 (Missense) is the least likely to guarantee inactivation.\n    *   Mutants 2 (Nonsense), 3 (Frameshift), and 4 (Frameshift) are all highly likely to inactivate the gene.\n    *   However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is arguably the most definitive and \"cleanest\" knockout. It introduces a hard stop at the third codon, guaranteeing the production of a tiny, useless dipeptide. The cellular machinery of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) would likely also target this mutant mRNA for destruction, preventing any protein from being made. While frameshifts are also highly effective, the introduction of an early and unambiguous stop codon is the most certain method among the choices to abolish protein function.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 presents the highest probability of successfully eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
