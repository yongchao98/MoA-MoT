    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Basic Structure:** The problem states the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This corresponds to a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents, meaning four hydrogens are directly attached to the ring. The core of the molecule is therefore C6H4.\n\n2.  **Interpret the FTIR Spectrum:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). An ester group contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and one ether-like oxygen. It contributes two oxygen atoms to the molecular formula.\n\n3.  **Interpret the 1H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed information about the structure.\n    *   **Aromatic-H signals (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring with two distinct signals for its four protons is characteristic of a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern. This gives two sets of two equivalent protons, each appearing as a doublet. This confirms the C6H4 core.\n    *   **Vinyl-H signals (2 signals):** There are two hydrogens on a carbon-carbon double bond. One signal is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   The H atom adjacent to the CH3 group is split by the other vinyl H (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the CH3 group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The other vinyl H is split only by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a doublet.\n        *   This fragment has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **-CH3 signals (2 signals):** There are two distinct methyl (-CH3) groups.\n        *   One of these belongs to the propenyl group we just identified (-CH=CH-**CH3**).\n        *   The other must be part of the ester group.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means there are no methylene groups in the structure. The ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), and the other substituent cannot be an allyl group (-CH2-CH=CH2) or a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3). This supports our identification of the methyl-containing ester and the propenyl group. The ester group must be either a methyl ester (Ar-COO-CH3) or an acetate group (Ar-O-CO-CH3). Both contain one CH3 group and no CH2 groups.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:** Now we can assemble the molecular fragments we have identified to find the total chemical formula.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** -CH=CH-CH3 → C3H5\n    *   **Ester functionality with a methyl group:** This can be either a methyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OCOCH3).\n        *   The -COOCH3 fragment contributes C=2, H=3, O=2.\n        *   The -OCOCH3 fragment contributes C=2, H=3, O=2.\n        *   Both possibilities add C2H3O2 to the formula.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Formula:** Sum the atoms from all the fragments:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = 12\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester) = 2\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2\n    *   B) C12H12O2\n    *   C) C11H12O2\n    *   D) C11H14O2\n\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option C. The other formulas are inconsistent with the NMR data, particularly the absence of -CH2- signals. For instance, C11H14O2 would imply saturation of the propenyl double bond to a propyl group, which would have CH2 signals. C12H14O2 could correspond to an ethyl ester, which would also have a CH2 signal.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
