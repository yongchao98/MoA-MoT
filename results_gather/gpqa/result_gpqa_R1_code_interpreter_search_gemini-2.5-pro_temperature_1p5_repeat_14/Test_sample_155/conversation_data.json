    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze the Reactions**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the stereochemical outcome of the two-step reaction sequence applied to two different starting materials. The reaction sequence is:\n1.  Epoxidation with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).\n2.  Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide with water (H3O+).\n\nThis overall process results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene, meaning the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to the opposite faces of the original double bond.\n\nA helpful mnemonic for the stereochemistry of such additions is:\n*   **C**is-alkene + **A**nti-addition → **R**acemic mixture (enantiomers)\n*   **T**rans-alkene + **A**nti-addition → **M**eso compound\n\nLet's apply this to each reaction.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. The structure is symmetric, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** As established, this is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n3.  **Applying the Rule (T + A → M):** A *trans*-alkene undergoing *anti*-addition yields a *meso* compound.\n4.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is *meso*-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule, even though it has chiral centers. Let's label this product **M**. Specifically, it is the (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which is identical to (4S, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n3.  **Applying the Rule (C + A → R):** A *cis*-alkene undergoing *anti*-addition yields a *racemic* mixture of enantiomers.\n4.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The products are a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers of octane-4,5-diol: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's label these enantiomers **E1** and **E2**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct chemical compounds (stereoisomers):\n\n*   **M**: The meso-diol from Reaction 1.\n*   **E1**: One enantiomer of the diol from Reaction 2, e.g., (4R, 5R).\n*   **E2**: The other enantiomer from Reaction 2, e.g., (4S, 5S).\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers of each other.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **E1**.\n*   **M** is also a diastereomer of **E2**.\n\n### **Part 3: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe final step is to predict how this mixture of three compounds will behave on the two different HPLC columns.\n\n**A) Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity and size. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Diastereomers (**M** vs. **E1**/**E2**) have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers (**E1** vs. **E2**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: The meso compound **M**.\n    *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers **E1** and **E2**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC:**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with the two enantiomers of a chiral molecule. It can separate enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The column will separate the diastereomers (**M** from **E1**/**E2**).\n    *   Crucially, the chiral column will also separate the enantiomers **E1** and **E2** from each other.\n*   **Observation:** All three stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase. Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: The meso compound **M**.\n    *   Peak 2: Enantiomer **E1**.\n    *   Peak 3: Enantiomer **E2**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
