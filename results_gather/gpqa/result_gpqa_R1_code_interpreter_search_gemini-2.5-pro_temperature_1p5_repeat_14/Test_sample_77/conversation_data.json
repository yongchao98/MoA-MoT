    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Identify the given quantities:\n*   `q`: the point charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t)$: the trajectory (position vector) of the charge as a function of time `t`.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: the position vector of the point where the field is observed (the field point).\n*   `t`: the time of observation.\n*   `tr`: the retarded time. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted by the charge to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`.\n*   $\\vec{s}(tr)$: the position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$: the vector from the position of the charge at the retarded time to the observation point.\n*   `d = |\\vec{d}|`: the magnitude of this vector, which is the distance the signal traveled.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ evaluated at $t'=tr$: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `c`: the speed of light in vacuum.\n*   $\\epsilon_o$: the permittivity of free space.\n*   $\\mu_o$: the permeability of free space.\n\n### 2. The Retarded Time Condition:\nThe fundamental concept behind the Liénard-Wiechert potentials is that electromagnetic effects propagate at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potential at point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, `tr`, such that the time it took for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is `t - tr`.\n\nThis gives the retarded time condition:\n$t - tr = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|}{c} = \\frac{d}{c}$\n$d = c(t - tr)$\n\n### 3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:\nThe potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general retarded potential formulas by integrating over the charge and current densities for a point particle. The standard results, known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)| \\left(1 - \\frac{(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)) \\cdot \\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)|c}\\right)}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)| \\left(1 - \\frac{(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)) \\cdot \\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)|c}\\right)}$\n\n### 4. Rewriting in the given notation:\nLet's substitute the given notation into these standard formulas.\nWe have:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$\n*   $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|$\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity at `tr`.\n\nSo the potentials become:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}\\right)}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}\\right)}$\n\n### 5. Simplifying the expressions:\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n$d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}\\right) = d - \\frac{d(\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}{dc} = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSo the potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nNow, let's manipulate the denominator to match the form in the options. We can get a common denominator of `c`:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expressions for V and A:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 6. Compare with the options:\nLet's compare these derived expressions with the given options.\n\n*   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**\n    This exactly matches our derived results.\n\n*   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**\n    This has a plus sign in the denominator. This corresponds to the advanced potentials (which are typically considered unphysical as they violate causality), not the retarded potentials required by the problem ($t > tr$).\n\n*   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**\n    The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which is only valid for a stationary charge and does not account for retardation effects. The relationship between A and V, $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2) V$, is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials (since $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$), but the potential V itself is wrong.\n\n*   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**\n    The expression for V is incorrect. The relationship given for A is dimensionally incorrect as $\\vec{A}$ is a vector, while $\\vec{v}^2$ is a scalar.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions are given in Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
