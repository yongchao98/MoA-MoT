    "This problem requires us to calculate the minimum resolution of a detector to observe a specific fraction of particle decays. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the physics and calculations involved.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Concepts\n\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle $X^0$ is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. Due to special relativity, its lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber) will be longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$). This phenomenon is known as time dilation. The mean lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$, is given by $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Decay Length:** The distance a particle travels in the lab frame before it decays is called the decay length, $L$. Because particles decay randomly, this is a statistical quantity. The average distance a particle travels before decaying is the mean decay length, $\\lambda = v \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability that a particle has not decayed after a time $t$ (or after traveling a distance $L=vt$) follows an exponential decay law: $P(t_{decay} > t) = e^{-t/\\tau}$ or equivalently $P(L_{decay} > L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$.\n*   **Detector Resolution:** The resolution of a detector is the smallest distance it can measure. If a particle is created at position A and decays at position B, the detector can only \"observe\" this decay if the distance between A and B (the decay length) is greater than its resolution, $L_{res}$.\n\n### 2. The Condition for Observation\n\nThe problem states we need to observe *at least 30%* of the decays. If our detector has a resolution of $L_{res}$, we will observe all decays that occur at a distance $L > L_{res}$. The fraction of such decays is given by the exponential decay law:\n$$\n\\text{Fraction Observed} = P(L > L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda}\n$$\nWe are given that this fraction must be at least 30% (or 0.3). To find the boundary condition (the largest possible resolution length that still satisfies the condition), we set the fraction to 0.3:\n$$\ne^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.3\n$$\nSolving for $L_{res}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.3)\n$$\n$$\nL_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.3)\n$$\nA higher resolution (smaller $L_{res}$) would allow observing more than 30% of the decays. Therefore, this value represents the maximum allowed length for the resolution, which corresponds to the \"minimum resolution\" capability required.\n\n### 3. Calculation Steps\n\n**a) Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\nThe total energy $E$ of a relativistic particle is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$. In particle physics, mass is often given in units of energy (GeV), which is shorthand for $m_0 c^2$.\n*   $E = 27 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_0 c^2 = 3.41 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.91789\n$$\n\n**b) Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame is $\\lambda = \\frac{p c}{m_0 c^2} \\times (c \\tau_0)$, where $p$ is the particle's momentum. We first need to find the momentum $p$. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n*   $E = 27 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_0c^2 = 3.41 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$$\n(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2\n$$\n$$\npc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.784 \\text{ GeV}\n$$\nNow we can calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$:\n*   $pc = 26.784 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_0c^2 = 3.41 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}$\n*   $c = 2.9979 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0 c^2} \\times c \\tau_0 = \\frac{26.784}{3.41} \\times (2.9979 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda \\approx 7.8545 \\times (2.3983 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.8838 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}\n$$\n\n**c) Calculate the Required Resolution ($L_{res}$):**\nUsing the formula derived in step 2:\n*   $\\lambda \\approx 1.8838 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n*   $\\ln(0.3) \\approx -1.204$\n\n$$\nL_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.3) \\approx -(1.8838 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}\n$$\nTo verify the calculation with a script:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants provided in the problem\nE_GeV = 27.0\nm0c2_GeV = 3.41\ntau0_s = 8e-16\nc_m_per_s = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the momentum in GeV/c\n# (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m0c^2)^2\npc_GeV = np.sqrt(E_GeV**2 - m0c2_GeV**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in meters\n# lambda = (pc / m0c^2) * c * tau0\nmean_decay_length_m = (pc_GeV / m0c2_GeV) * c_m_per_s * tau0_s\n\n# Calculate the required resolution (L_res) in meters\n# We need to observe at least 30% of decays, so P(L > L_res) >= 0.3\n# exp(-L_res / lambda) = 0.3  => L_res = -lambda * ln(0.3)\nfraction_to_observe = 0.3\nresolution_m = -mean_decay_length_m * np.log(fraction_to_observe)\n\nprint(f\"{resolution_m}\")\n```\nThe script's output confirms the result:\n```\n2.268069818828941e-06\n```\n\nThe calculated resolution is $2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1} \\text{ m}$\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}$\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}$\n\nThe value $2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$ is closest to option B. The slight difference is likely due to slightly different constants or a minor typo in the problem's options (e.g., if the proper lifetime were slightly smaller, around $7.3 \\times 10^{-16}$ s, the answer would be exactly $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). Given the choices, B is the only physically plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum detector resolution needed to observe a certain fraction of particle decays. The key physical concepts involved are relativistic time dilation, the exponential decay law, and the relationship between a detector's resolution and its ability to observe a decay event.\n\n**1. Relativistic Effects and Decay Length**\n\nA particle with proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ moving at a relativistic speed has its lifetime extended in the laboratory frame due to time dilation. The lab-frame lifetime $\\tau$ is given by:\n$\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe Lorentz factor can be calculated from the particle's total energy $E$ and its rest mass energy $m_0c^2$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n\nThe average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is called the mean decay length, $\\lambda$. It is given by:\n$\\lambda = v\\tau = v(\\gamma\\tau_0)$\nwhere $v$ is the particle's velocity. A more convenient formula for calculation uses the particle's momentum, $p$:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c\\tau_0$\nThe momentum term $pc$ can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2 \\implies pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n\n**2. Observation Condition and Detector Resolution**\n\nThe decay of particles follows an exponential probability distribution. The probability that a particle travels a distance $L$ or more before decaying is:\n$P(\\text{decay length} > L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$\n\nFor a decay to be \"observed,\" the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, $L_{res}$. The problem states that at least 30% of the decays must be observed. This translates to the following condition:\n$P(\\text{decay length} > L_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum required resolution (which corresponds to the largest possible value of $L_{res}$ that still satisfies the condition), we use the equality:\n$e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nSolving for $L_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-L_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$L_{res} = -\\lambda \\times \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**3.

This value is very close to option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters. The small difference is likely due to slight variations in the constants used or minor rounding in the problem's options.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics\nThe problem involves a relativistic particle ($X^0$) that decays. We need to find the detector resolution required to observe a certain percentage of these decays. The key concepts are:\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of the moving particle as observed in the lab (the Bubble Chamber) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This observed lifetime is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor relates the energy and mass of a relativistic particle: $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$.\n*   **Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before it decays.
