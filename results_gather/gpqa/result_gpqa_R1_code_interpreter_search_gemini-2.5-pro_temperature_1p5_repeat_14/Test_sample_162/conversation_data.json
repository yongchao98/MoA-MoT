    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Reaction and Stoichiometry**\n\nFirst, we need to dissolve iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, which is a base, using a strong monobasic acid (like HCl or HNO₃), which provides H⁺ ions. The neutralization reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThis equation tells us that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions to dissolve completely.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nWe are given 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃. We need to convert this mass to moles using its molar mass.\n*   Molar mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNow, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:\nMoles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**3. Determine the Moles of H⁺ Required**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the acid serves two purposes:\n*   **Part 1:** To react stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   **Part 2:** To remain in the solution, creating the final acidic pH.\n\nTotal Moles H⁺ added = (Moles H⁺ for reaction) + (Moles H⁺ remaining)\n\n**4. Analyze the Options**\n\nSince this is a multiple-choice question, the most efficient approach is to check which of the given options is self-consistent. We can test each pair of (pH, Volume) to see if the numbers work out. Let's test Option A.\n\n**Testing Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n*   **Given Volume of Acid:** V = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n*   **Given pH:** pH = 2.69\n\nLet's verify if this is consistent.\n\n*   **Step 4a: Calculate total moles of H⁺ added.**\n    The acid is 0.1 M.\n    Total H⁺ added = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = 0.003009 mol\n\n*   **Step 4b: Calculate moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction.**\n    From step 2 and the stoichiometry, this is:\n    Moles H⁺ for reaction = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × (9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 0.002807 mol\n\n*   **Step 4c: Calculate the moles of H⁺ remaining in the solution.**\n    Moles H⁺ remaining = (Total H⁺ added) - (Moles H⁺ for reaction)\n    Moles H⁺ remaining = 0.003009 mol - 0.002807 mol = 0.000202 mol\n\n*   **Step 4d: Calculate the final [H⁺] and pH.**\n    The final total volume is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    Final [H⁺] = Moles H⁺ remaining / Total Volume = 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M\n    Calculated pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.00202) ≈ 2.6947\n\nThe calculated pH (2.695) matches the pH given in Option A (2.69). Therefore, this option is consistent and correct.\n\n**Verification using Code**\n\nTo be certain, we can use a script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants from the problem\nmass_feoh3 = 0.1  # g\ntotal_volume_L = 0.100  # 100 cm3 in L\nacid_conc = 0.1  # M\n\n# Molar masses\nmolar_mass_fe = 55.845  # g/mol\nmolar_mass_o = 15.999  # g/mol\nmolar_mass_h = 1.008  # g/mol\nmolar_mass_feoh3 = molar_mass_fe + 3 * (molar_mass_o + molar_mass_h)\n\n# Moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved\nmoles_feoh3 = mass_feoh3 / molar_mass_feoh3\n\n# Moles of H+ needed for stoichiometric reaction\nmoles_H_react = 3 * moles_feoh3\n\n# --- Test Option A ---\nV_acid_A_cm3 = 30.09\nV_acid_A_L = V_acid_A_cm3 / 1000.0\n\n# Calculate total moles of H+ added from the acid\nmoles_H_added = acid_conc * V_acid_A_L\n\n# Calculate moles of H+ remaining after reaction\nmoles_H_final = moles_H_added - moles_H_react\n\n# Calculate the concentration of H+ in the final 100 cm3 solution\nconc_H_final = moles_H_final / total_volume_L\n\n# Calculate the pH from the final H+ concentration\ncalculated_pH = -math.log10(conc_H_final)\n\nprint(f\"Testing Option A (pH 2.69; {V_acid_A_cm3} cm3):\")\nprint(f\"Calculated pH is: {calculated_pH:.2f}\")\nprint(\"This matches the given pH.\")\n\n# --- Test Option C for comparison ---\nV_acid_C_cm3 = 28.05\nV_acid_C_L = V_acid_C_cm3 / 1000.0\nmoles_H_added_C = acid_conc * V_acid_C_L\nprint(\"\\nTesting Option C (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3):\")\nprint(f\"Moles of H+ added: {moles_H_added_C:.5f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of H+ needed for reaction: {moles_H_react:.5f} mol\")\nprint(\"Conclusion: Insufficient acid added to even complete the reaction.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe goal is to find the volume of a strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and achieve a specific final pH in a total volume of 100 cm³. Since this is a multiple-choice question, the most efficient method is to test the given options to see which one is self-consistent.\n\n**2. Stoichiometric Reaction**\n\nFirst, write down the chemical reaction between iron(III) hydroxide (a base) and a strong monobasic acid (which provides H⁺ ions):\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThis equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions to dissolve completely.\n\n**3. Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nCalculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol (Fe: 55.85, O: 16.00, H: 1.01).\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 moles.\n\n**4. Moles of H⁺ for Reaction**\n\nUsing the stoichiometry from step 2, calculate the moles of H⁺ needed just to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃:\n*   Moles of H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ (reaction) ≈ 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 moles.\n\nThis means we need to add at least enough acid to provide 0.002807 moles of H⁺. The volume of 0.1 M acid required for this is:\n*   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nAny volume less than 28.07 cm³ would be insufficient to dissolve all the Fe(OH)₃. This immediately eliminates Option B (20.40 cm³) and Option C (28.05 cm³). We are left to test options A and D.\n\n**5. Testing Option A**\n\nLet's check if the values in Option A (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³) are consistent.\n\n*   **Total H⁺ Added:**\n    *   Volume of acid = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ added = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = 0.003009 moles.\n\n*   **Excess H⁺ Remaining:**\n    *   The total H⁺ added is used for two things: reacting with Fe(OH)₃ and remaining in the solution to set the pH.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ remaining = (Total H⁺ added) - (H⁺ for reaction)\n    *   Moles of H⁺ remaining ≈ 0.003009 mol - 0.002807 mol = 0.000202 moles.\n\n*   **Calculate Final pH:**\n    *   This excess H⁺ (0.000202 moles) is in a final total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   Final [H⁺] = Moles / Volume = 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\n    *   pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.00202) ≈ 2.695.\n\nThis calculated pH of 2.695 matches the pH of 2.69 given in Option A. The values are consistent.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculations confirm that adding 30.09 cm³ of the 0.1 M acid is sufficient to dissolve the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and results in a final solution with a pH of 2.69.\n\n<<<A>>>"
