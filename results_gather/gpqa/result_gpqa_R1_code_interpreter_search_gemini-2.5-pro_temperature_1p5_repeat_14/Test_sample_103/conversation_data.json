    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the Doppler shift in the spectrum of the host star. The planet and star orbit their common center of mass, causing the star to wobble. This wobble creates a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity is related to the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) by the Doppler formula:\n$\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\nwhere $v_r$ is the star's radial velocity (its velocity along our line of sight) and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted as $K_{star}$. Therefore, $K_{star}$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\n### 2. Relate the Observed Wavelength Shifts to the Stars' Velocities\n\nWe are given:\n- Wavelength shift for system 1: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ\n- Wavelength shift for system 2: $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ\n\nSince $K_{star} \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, we can find the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\nThis tells us that Star #2 is wobbling with a 1.4 times greater maximum velocity than Star #1.\n\n### 3. Find the Physical Relationship between Star Velocity ($K_{star}$) and Planet's Orbital Period (P)\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude $K_{star}$ for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n$K_{star} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n\nWhere:\n- $P$ is the orbital period.\n- $M_{planet}$ is the mass of the planet.\n- $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n- $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n- $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nIn this problem, we are given:\n- The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n- The planets have similar masses. In RV measurements, the quantity determined is the \"minimum mass\", $M_{planet} \\sin(i)$. The statement implies that this value is the same for both planets: $M_{planet1} \\sin(i_1) = M_{planet2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n\nWith these conditions, most terms in the formula for $K_{star}$ are constant for both systems ($G, M_{star}, M_{planet} \\sin(i)$). The only variable that differs is the orbital period, $P$.\n\nTherefore, we can establish a proportionality:\n$K_{star} \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K_{star} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nUsing the proportionality from Step 3, we can write a ratio:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n\nFrom Step 2, we know $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4$. So we have:\n$1.4 = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n\nWe need to solve for the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. To do this, we can raise both sides of the equation to the power of -3:\n$\\left(1.4\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3}\\right)^{-3}$\n$\\frac{1}{1.4^3} = \\frac{P_2}{P_1}$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value.\n$1.4^2 = 1.96$\n$1.4^3 = 1.96 \\times 1.4 = 2.744$\n\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744}$\n\nTo get a precise decimal value, let's perform the division.\n```python\nprint(1 / (1.4**3))\n```\n```output\n0.3644314868804665\n```\n\nThe ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$ is approximately 0.36.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. This makes sense intuitively: a larger wobble ($K_2 > K_1$) for the same star and planet masses implies the planet must be in a tighter, faster orbit, and thus have a shorter period ($P_2 < P_1$).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nOur calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
