    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we need to deduce the structure of the product formed in the reaction from the given 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra. The molecular formula of the starting material, Compound X, is C11H12O. The reaction described is an isomerization, as no other reactants are added to be incorporated into the final structure, and the conditions (heat, base catalyst) are typical for rearrangements. Therefore, the product also has the formula C11H12O.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ 2.28 (3H, s)**: This indicates a methyl group (-CH3) attached to a carbon with no protons (a quaternary carbon or part of a group like C=O or an aromatic ring). The integration is 3H.\n*   **δ 2.31 (3H, s)**: This indicates a second, chemically distinct methyl group, also attached to a carbon with no protons. The integration is 3H.\n*   **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**: This pattern (two doublets, each integrating to 2H) in the aromatic region is highly characteristic of a **para-substituted benzene ring**. This accounts for 4 aromatic protons.\n*   **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**: This pattern (two doublets, each integrating to 1H) is characteristic of a **disubstituted double bond** (-CH=CH-), where the two protons are coupled to each other. The large coupling constant typical for such signals (though not given, it can be inferred) and the chemical shifts suggest a *trans* configuration.\n\n**13C NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ 197.7 (1C, s)**: This chemical shift is in the characteristic range for a **carbonyl carbon (C=O)**, specifically that of a ketone or aldehyde. Given the presence of a methyl singlet in the 1H NMR, an acetyl group (-COCH3) is a strong possibility. The value suggests conjugation, i.e., an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **δ 21.3 (1C, s)** and **δ 28.4 (1C, s)**: These are the two methyl carbons corresponding to the two singlets in the 1H NMR spectrum. The δ 21.3 is typical for a methyl group on an aromatic ring, and δ 28.4 is typical for an acetyl methyl group.\n*   **δ 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C)**: These six carbons are in the alkene/aromatic region (sp2 hybridized C-H). This matches the 6 protons found in this region in the 1H NMR (4 from the benzene ring, 2 from the C=C double bond).\n*   **δ 141.5 (1C)** and **δ 144.1 (1C)**: These are two quaternary (no attached H) sp2 carbons, consistent with the points of attachment on the para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the Product Structure**\n\nLet's combine these fragments:\n1.  A para-substituted benzene ring.\n2.  Two methyl groups, one likely on the ring (forming a *p-tolyl* group) and one as part of an acetyl group.\n3.  A ketone (C=O).\n4.  A trans double bond (-CH=CH-).\n\nThe most logical way to connect these pieces to form a stable molecule with the formula C11H12O is **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   **Structure:** `(p-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`\n*   **Formula:** C11H12O. Correct.\n*   **1H NMR signals:**\n    *   *p-tolyl* CH3: One singlet. (Matches δ 2.31)\n    *   Acetyl CH3: One singlet. (Matches δ 2.28)\n    *   *p-tolyl* ring protons: Two doublets, 2H each. (Matches δ 7.08 and 7.71)\n    *   Vinyl protons (-CH=CH-): Two doublets, 1H each. (Matches δ 6.75 and 7.68)\nThe predicted 1H NMR spectrum pattern perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction converts Compound X (C11H12O) into the product identified above. This is a base-catalyzed (DABCO) thermal (403 K = 130 °C) isomerization. We must evaluate the given options to see which isomer could rearrange to form the product.\n\n*   **Product:** `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-CO-CH3`\n*   **A) 2-styrylepoxide:** `Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`. Formula C10H10O. Incorrect formula.\n*   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** `Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-CH3`. Formula C11H12O. This starting material has a phenyl group, but the product has a *p-tolyl* group. This would require migration of a methyl group onto the aromatic ring, which is not plausible under these conditions.\n*   **C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** `Ph-CH=C(CH3)-CH(O)CH2`. Formula C11H12O. This also starts with a phenyl group, not a *p-tolyl* group. Unlikely.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** `(p-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`. This can be written as `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`.\n\nLet's analyze option D:\n*   **Formula:** C11H12O. Correct.\n*   **Structure:** It has the `p-tolyl` group and the `CH=CH` vinyl group, just like the product. The difference is in the final part of the chain: the starting material has a terminal epoxide (`-CH(O)CH2`), while the product has a methyl ketone (`-CO-CH3`).\n*   **Reaction:** The required transformation is the isomerization of a terminal epoxide group to a methyl ketone group, adjacent to a vinyl group.\n    ` (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-` **`CH(O)CH2`**   ->   `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-` **`CO-CH3`**\nThis is a known type of reaction called the **epoxide-ketone rearrangement**. It can be catalyzed by acids or bases. The reaction is driven by the formation of the thermodynamically stable conjugated ketone product. Given the conditions (DABCO base, high temperature), this rearrangement is entirely plausible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe product of the reaction is (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The only starting material from the options that is an isomer and can plausibly rearrange to this product under the given conditions is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
