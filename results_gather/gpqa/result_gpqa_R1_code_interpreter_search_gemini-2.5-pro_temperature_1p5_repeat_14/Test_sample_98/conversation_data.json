    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is correct for all candidates but doesn't help distinguish between them. The key to solving the problem lies in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides detailed information about the structure and the connectivity of atoms by looking at the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the signals. We are given two very complex and specific splitting patterns:\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being split by three different neighboring groups of protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** It is coupled to **one** adjacent proton (n=1, n+1=2 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** It is coupled to a group of **two** equivalent adjacent protons (n=2, n+1=3 lines).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** It is coupled to a group of **three** equivalent adjacent protons (n=3, n+1=4 lines).\n    *   **Environment needed:** A methine proton (`-CH-`) must be adjacent to another `-CH-` group, a `-CH₂-` group, and a `-CH₃` group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a different single proton is being split by three different neighboring groups.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** It is coupled to **one** adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** It is coupled to a group of **two** equivalent adjacent protons (n=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** It is coupled to another, different group of **two** equivalent adjacent protons (n=2).\n    *   **Environment needed:** A methine proton (`-CH-`) must be adjacent to another `-CH-` group and two different `-CH₂-` groups.\n\nThe correct compound must have both of these environments in its structure.\n\n### **3. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of each option to see if it contains protons that would produce these signals. We'll simplify by assuming ideal splitting and that diastereotopic protons behave as equivalent groups for this analysis.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃(h)-CH(a)(C₂H₅)-CH(f)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(g)-COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(a) (at C4):** This proton is on a `-CH-` carbon. Its neighbors are:\n        *   `H(f)` at C3 (1 proton) → creates a **doublet**.\n        *   `-CH₂-` of the ethyl group at C4 (2 protons) → creates a **triplet**.\n        *   `-CH₃(h)` group at C5 (3 protons) → creates a **quartet**.\n        *   The combined splitting is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **Proton H(f) (at C3):** This proton is on a `-CH-` carbon. Its neighbors are:\n        *   `H(a)` at C4 (1 proton) → creates a **doublet**.\n        *   `-CH₂(g)-` group at C2 (2 protons) → creates a **triplet**.\n        *   `-CH₂-` of the ethyl group at C3 (2 protons) → creates another **triplet**.\n        *   The combined splitting is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule has both the required proton environments.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃-CH(a)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(b) at C3:** Neighbors are `H(a)` (1H), the `-CH₂-` at C2 (2H), and the `-CH₃` at C3 (3H). This creates a **dtq**.\n    *   **Proton H(a) at C4:** Neighbors are `H(b)` (1H), the `-CH₃` on C4 (3H), and the `-CH₃` at C5 (3H). This creates a doublet of quartets of quartets (`dqq`), not a `dtt`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule does not have a proton that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃CH₂-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH(a)(CH₃)-COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(b) at C3:** Neighbors are `H(a)` (1H), the `-CH₂-` of the ethyl group (2H), and the `-CH₃` at C3 (3H). This creates a **dtq**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in the structure adjacent to a `-CH-` and two different `-CH₂-` groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule does not have a proton that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃CH₂-CH(b)(C₂H₅)-CH(a)(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(b) at C3:** Neighbors are `H(a)` (1H), the `-CH₂-` from the main chain at C4 (2H), and the `-CH₂-` of the ethyl group at C3 (2H). This creates a **dtt**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in the structure adjacent to a `-CH-`, a `-CH₂-`, and a `-CH₃` group to create a `dtq`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule does not have a proton that would produce a `dtq` signal.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nOnly **structure A (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)** has protons in environments that would produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets AND a doublet of triplets of triplets. Therefore, this is the correct identity of the unknown compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
