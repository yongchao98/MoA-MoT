    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and its Hamiltonian:**\n    The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. Since $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, the potential can be written as $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system, $H\\psi = E\\psi$, can be separated in Cartesian coordinates. The Hamiltonian is:\n    $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2 = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n    where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x_i^2$ for $i=x, y, z$.\n    Each $H_i$ is the Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator are $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$.\n    For the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies from each dimension:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    Let the principal quantum number be $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    We need to find the energy for the third excited state. Let's list the first few energy levels:\n    *   **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible value of $n$, which is $n=0$ (when $n_x=n_y=n_z=0$).\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to the next value of $n$, which is $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that correspond to the same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n    The general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the $n$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, we can list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n    *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) --- 3 states.\n    *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) --- 6 states.\n    *   Permutations of (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) --- 1 state.\n    Total number of states = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n    Each of these 10 states corresponds to a unique, linearly independent eigenfunction. Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy eigenvalue.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated energy for the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10.\n    This matches option D.\n\n    *   A) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$ - Incorrect energy value and formula.\n    *   B) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3$ - Incorrect energy and degeneracy.\n    *   C) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$ - Correct energy but incorrect degeneracy. (Degeneracy of 3 corresponds to the first excited state, n=1).\n    *   D) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 10$ - Correct energy and correct degeneracy.\n\nI will use a python script to verify the number of combinations summing to 3.\n```python\n# Calculate the degeneracy for the third excited state (n=3)\n# of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.\nn = 3\ncount = 0\n# Iterate through all possible values of nx, ny, nz from 0 to n.\nfor nx in range(n + 1):\n    for ny in range(n + 1):\n        for nz in range(n + 1):\n            if nx + ny + nz == n:\n                count += 1\n                \nprint(f\"The degeneracy for n=3 is: {count}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nThe degeneracy for n=3 is: 10\n</execute_result>\nThe code confirms that the degeneracy for the n=3 level is 10.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the energy and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) of the third excited state for a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n### Step 1: Set up the Schrödinger Equation and find the Energy Eigenvalues\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. In Cartesian coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, so the potential is $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$.\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is:\n$H\\psi = E\\psi$\n\nThe Hamiltonian operator $H$ can be written as:\n$H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V(r) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$\n\nThis Hamiltonian is separable in Cartesian coordinates, meaning it can be written as the sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\nwhere $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x_i^2$ for $i \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n\nThe energy eigenvalue of a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator is known to be $E_{n_i} = \\left(n_i + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nThe total energy of the three-dimensional system is the sum of the energies of the three one-dimensional oscillators:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = \\left(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega + \\left(n_y + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega + \\left(n_z + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = \\left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = \\left(n + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega$, for $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Energy of the Third Excited State\n\nWe need to identify the energy levels corresponding to the ground state and the first few excited states:\n*   **Ground State:** This is the lowest possible energy state, which corresponds to the smallest value of $n$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z \\ge 0$, the minimum value for their sum is $n = 0$ (when $n_x=n_y=n_z=0$).\n    Energy: $E_0 = \\left(0 + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **First Excited State:** This is the next higher energy level, corresponding to $n = 1$.\n    Energy: $E_1 = \\left(1 + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n    Energy: $E_2 = \\left(2 + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n    Energy: $E_3 = \\left(3 + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (i.e., combinations of $n_x, n_y, n_z$) that have the same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n\nWe can list the possible combinations:\n1.  Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) $\\implies$ 3 states.\n2.  Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) $\\implies$ 6 states.\n3.  Permutations of (1, 1, 1): (1, 1, 1) $\\implies$ 1 state.\n\nThe total number of states is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\nEach of these 10 states corresponds to a unique, linearly independent eigenfunction. Therefore, the degeneracy of the third excited state is 10.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ of the $n$-th energy level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Options\n\n*   **Energy of the third excited state:** $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy):** 10\n\nMatching these results with the given options:\nA) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$ - Incorrect energy value and formula.\nB) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3$ - Incorrect energy and degeneracy.\nC) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$ - Correct energy, but incorrect degeneracy.\nD) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10$ - Correct energy and correct degeneracy.\n\n<<<D>>>"
