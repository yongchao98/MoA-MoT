    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n\n*   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents attached.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** A total of 8 carbon atoms. A benzene ring contains 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must have 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond is present, meaning a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   Based on the information, we have a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   The most common and stable chemical group that fits the description \"2 carbons and a carbonyl group\" is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. Its general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n*   Let's check the carbon count: 6 carbons in the ring + 2 carbons in the acetyl group = 8 carbons total. This is correct.\n*   Let's check the functional groups: We have an aromatic-halogen bond (X-C₆) and a carbonyl group (in -COCH₃). This is also correct.\n\n**3. Analyze the Isomers and Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\nThe two substituents (-X and -COCH₃) can be arranged in three possible positions on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The 1H NMR spectrum will be different for each isomer.\n\n*   **Ortho and Meta Isomers:** In these isomers, all four protons on the benzene ring are chemically non-equivalent. This would result in a complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region (typically 4 different signals, likely multiplets).\n*   **Para Isomer (1,4-disubstitution):** This isomer is symmetrical. The four protons on the benzene ring are chemically equivalent in two pairs.\n    *   This high symmetry leads to a much simpler and very characteristic 1H NMR pattern for the aromatic region: **two doublets**, with each doublet integrating to **2 protons**.\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH₃) contains a methyl group with three equivalent protons. Since the adjacent atom (the carbonyl carbon) has no protons, this methyl group will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3 protons**. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl is typically around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   The aromatic protons are deshielded and will appear further downfield, typically in the **7.0-8.0 ppm** range.\n\n**Summary of Predicted Spectrum for p-Haloacetophenone:**\n*   A singlet (3H) around 2.3 ppm.\n*   A doublet (2H) in the aromatic region.\n*   Another doublet (2H) in the aromatic region.\n\n**4. Compare the Prediction with the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts are incorrect. 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too low for aromatic protons. 1.3 ppm is too low for an acetyl methyl group.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone. The compound described has a ketone (in the acetyl group). This option is inconsistent with the deduced structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The integration and splitting patterns are incorrect. A di-substituted ring should have 4 aromatic protons, but this option only accounts for 1 aromatic proton (6.9 ppm, s).\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is the classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate for aromatic protons.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet for 3 protons at a chemical shift characteristic of an acetyl methyl group.\n    *   This option perfectly matches our predicted spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data provided in option D is the only one that correctly describes this structure.\n\n<<<D>>>"
