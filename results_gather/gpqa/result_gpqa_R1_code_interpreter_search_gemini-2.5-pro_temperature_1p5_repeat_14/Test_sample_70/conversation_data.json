    "An astronomer is studying a system of five exoplanets (Planet_1 to Planet_5) in circular orbits around a star. The system was discovered using the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method, which is effective for detecting planets in orbital resonance. The orbital periods of these planets are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We are asked to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, assuming they have the same albedo.\n\n**1. Understand Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2a))\n\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `A` is the planet's bond albedo (the fraction of incident radiation reflected back to space).\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**2. Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2). Let's write out the ratio of the formulas:\n\n```\nT_eq(P4)   T_star * (1 - A_P4)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_P4))\n-------- = ----------------------------------------------------\nT_eq(P2)   T_star * (1 - A_P2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_P2))\n```\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are constant and cancel out. The problem states that the planets have the same albedo (`A_P4` = `A_P2`), so the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` terms also cancel. The constant `2` in the square root also cancels. This simplifies the equation significantly:\n\n```\nT_eq(P4)   sqrt(1 / a_P4)\n-------- = -------------- = sqrt(a_P2 / a_P4)\nT_eq(P2)   sqrt(1 / a_P2)\n```\n\nThis shows that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**3. Apply Kepler's Third Law**\n\nWe don't know the semi-major axes directly, but we do know the orbital periods. Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`T`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`):\n\nT² ∝ a³  or  a ∝ T^(2/3)\n\nWe can substitute this relationship into our temperature ratio equation:\n\n```\nT_eq(P4)           (T_P2)^(2/3)\n-------- = sqrt(----------------)\nT_eq(P2)           (T_P4)^(2/3)\n```\n\nSimplifying the exponents:\n\n```\nT_eq(P4)         ( (T_P2) / (T_P4) )^(2/3) )^(1/2)\n-------- =      (\nT_eq(P2)\n\nT_eq(P4)   (T_P2) ^( (2/3) * (1/2) )     (T_P2)^(1/3)\n-------- = --------                    = --------\nT_eq(P2)   (T_P4)                       (T_P4)\n```\n\nSo, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is equal to the cube root of the inverse ratio of their orbital periods.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nThe given ratio of orbital periods is T_1 : T_2 : T_3 : T_4 : T_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\nFrom this, we can determine the ratio of the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n\nT_P2 / T_P4 = 2 / 3.5\n\nNow, we plug this into our final equation:\n\nT_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n2 / 3.5 ≈ 0.5714\n(0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately **0.83**.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is ~0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>"
