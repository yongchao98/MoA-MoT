    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Equation**: The Mott-Gurney equation, $ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$, describes Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC). The key feature is the relationship $J \\propto V^2$. This tells us that the current is not governed by Ohm's Law ($J \\propto V$), which would be the case if the device's own charge carriers dominated. Instead, the current is limited by the charge *injected* from the contacts, which creates a \"space charge\" in the material.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Conditions for SCLC**: To understand which statement is true, we must consider the physical conditions (assumptions) required for the Mott-Gurney law to hold.\n\n    *   **Carrier Type**: The derivation of this equation considers only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) being injected and moving through the device. If both electrons and holes were injected (a \"two-carrier\" device), they would recombine, which is a different physical process not accounted for in this simple model. Therefore, it must be a **single-carrier device**. This eliminates option (D).\n\n    *   **Traps**: The injected charge carriers can be trapped in defect states within the material's bandgap. If traps are present, they capture some of the charge, reducing the number of mobile carriers and changing the current-voltage relationship (often leading to a V^n dependence where n > 2). The basic Mott-Gurney law assumes an ideal material with no such traps. Therefore, the device must be **trap-free**.\n\n    *   **Contact Type**: The \"space-charge\" limitation can only occur if the contact is capable of supplying more charge carriers than the bulk of the material can transport. Such a contact, which provides an abundant supply of carriers with no energy barrier for injection, is called an **Ohmic contact**. If the contact had an energy barrier (like a **Schottky contact**), the current would be limited by the ability of carriers to overcome this barrier (injection-limited current), not by the space charge in the bulk. Thus, the device requires an Ohmic contact, or equivalently, **no carrier injection barrier**. This eliminates option (C).\n\n    *   **Transport Mechanism**: The total current is a sum of drift current (due to the electric field) and diffusion current (due to carrier concentration gradients). The Mott-Gurney law is derived by assuming that the applied voltage is high enough that the drift current is the dominant transport mechanism. The diffusion current is considered to be **negligible**. This assumption is crucial.\n\n3.  **Review the Options against the Conditions**:\n\n    *   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   \"trap-free\": Correct.\n        *   \"single-carrier device\": Correct.\n        *   \"no carrier injection barrier\" (Ohmic contact): Correct.\n        *   \"negligible diffusion current\": Correct.\n        *   This statement accurately lists all the necessary conditions.\n\n    *   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n        *   \"negligible drift current\": Incorrect. The SCLC is fundamentally a drift current. This is the main flaw.\n\n    *   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   \"Schottky contact\": Incorrect. A Schottky contact would lead to injection-limited current, not space-charge-limited current.\n\n    *   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   \"two-carrier device\": Incorrect. The model is for single-carrier injection.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, option A is the only statement that correctly describes the set of assumptions under which the Mott-Gurney law is valid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
