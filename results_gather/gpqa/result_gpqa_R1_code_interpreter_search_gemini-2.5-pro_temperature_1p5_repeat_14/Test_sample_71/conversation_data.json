    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the first reaction.**\n*   **Reactant 1:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, also known as 7-tert-butoxynorbornadiene. This molecule will act as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction. It has two double bonds, and the problem states that 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are used, which strongly implies a double Diels-Alder reaction will occur, one at each double bond.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is treated with sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperatures. This is a known method for generating a highly reactive diene intermediate. The reaction of the `–CHBr2` groups with NaI results in a reductive elimination to form exocyclic double bonds (`=CH2`).\n*   **The generated diene:** The starting material, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, is converted into 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. This molecule is a reactive diene, an isomer of o-xylene, and is the diene for the subsequent Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   **Reaction 1 (Formation of Product 1):** Two molecules of the generated diene (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene) react with one molecule of 7-tert-butoxynorbornadiene in a double Diels-Alder reaction. The diene adds across both double bonds of the norbornadiene system, likely from the less sterically hindered *exo* face. This forms a complex, symmetric, polycyclic cage-like molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Transformation:** The tert-butoxy group (`-O-tBu`) is a tert-butyl ether. In the presence of a strong acid like H2SO4, this group is cleaved to form an alcohol (`-OH`) and a tert-butyl cation (which likely forms tert-butanol or isobutylene). This is a standard deprotection reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The structure is identical to Product 1, but the `-O-tBu` group at the C7 position has been replaced by a hydroxyl (`-OH`) group. Product 2 is a secondary alcohol. The overall symmetry of the molecule is maintained.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with SO3•pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Transformation:** This set of reagents is used for the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method to oxidize alcohols. Primary alcohols are converted to aldehydes, and secondary alcohols are converted to ketones.\n*   **Product 3:** Product 2 is a secondary alcohol. Oxidation converts the `-CH(OH)-` group at C7 into a carbonyl group (`C=O`). Product 3 is the corresponding ketone. The symmetry of the molecule is maintained.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4.**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Transformation:** Product 3 is a large polycyclic ketone formed via two Diels-Alder reactions. Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and the reverse reaction, known as the retro-Diels-Alder reaction, is favored by high temperatures due to an increase in entropy. Heating Product 3 will cause two sequential retro-Diels-Alder reactions, releasing the two diene molecules that were added in Step 1.\n*   The other product of this retro-Diels-Alder reaction is the central core, which would be bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one.\n*   This molecule is known to be thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic extrusion, losing a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form a very stable aromatic product: **benzene** (C6H6).\n*   **The products of the final step are therefore:**\n    1.  Two molecules of the regenerated diene: 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n    2.  One molecule of benzene.\n    3.  One molecule of carbon monoxide.\n\n**Identifying Product 4 and counting its distinct hydrogens.**\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final **product 4**. We have two major organic products: benzene and the diene.\n*   If product 4 were benzene, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms would be 1 (as all 6 hydrogens in benzene are equivalent due to symmetry). This is not among the options (A, B, C, D).\n*   Therefore, \"product 4\" must refer to the other organic product, the regenerated diene: **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n\n**Analysis of 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (Product 4).**\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4, and exocyclic double bonds (`=CH2`) at C5 and C6. Its molecular formula is C8H8.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule is non-planar but possesses a C2 axis of symmetry on the NMR time scale. This axis passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n*   **Chemical Equivalence:** The C2 symmetry makes pairs of atoms equivalent:\n    *   The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (Set 1)\n    *   The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (Set 2)\n    *   The two exocyclic methylene groups (`=CH2`) at C5 and C6 are equivalent. However, within each methylene group, the two hydrogens are diastereotopic (they are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule). Let's call them Ha and Hb.\n    *   The C2 axis interchanges Ha on C5 with Ha on C6, and Hb on C5 with Hb on C6.\n    *   Therefore, the two \"Ha\" protons form one equivalent set, and the two \"Hb\" protons form another. (Set 3 and Set 4).\n*   **Conclusion:** There are four sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. This would correspond to 4 signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe sets are: {H1, H4}, {H2, H3}, {H5a, H6a}, {H5b, H6b}.\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4 is 4."
