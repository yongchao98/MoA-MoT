    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (n₂/n₁) changes when a star has spots compared to when it does not. This factor can be expressed as:\n    Factor = (n₂/n₁)nospots / (n₂/n₁)spots\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Principle:** The population of atomic energy levels in a star's photosphere, assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n    n₂ / n₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   n₂, n₁ are the number of atoms in energy level 2 and 1.\n    *   g₂, g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   E₂, E₁ are the energies of the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the effective temperature of the photosphere.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratios:**\n    *   Let R_ns be the ratio (n₂/n₁) when there are no spots. The temperature is T_ns = 6000 K.\n        R_ns = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_ns))\n    *   Let R_s be the ratio (n₂/n₁) when there are spots. The temperature is T_s = 5500 K.\n        R_s = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_s))\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Factor:** We need to find the factor F = R_ns / R_s.\n    F = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_ns)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_s)) ]\n    The term (g₂/g₁) cancels out.\n    F = exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_ns)) / exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_s))\n    Using the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n    F = exp [ (-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_ns)) - (-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_s)) ]\n    F = exp [ (E₂ - E₁) / k * (1/T_s - 1/T_ns) ]\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (E₂ - E₁):** The problem states that the transition between the levels corresponds to a photon of a specific wavelength (λ). The energy of this photon is equal to the energy difference between the levels:\n    ΔE = E₂ - E₁ = h * c / λ\n    where:\n    *   h is the Planck constant.\n    *   c is the speed of light.\n    *   λ is the wavelength (1448 Å).\n\n6.  **Substitute and Prepare for Calculation:** Substitute the expression for ΔE into the equation for the factor F:\n    F = exp [ (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1/T_s - 1/T_ns) ]\n\n7.  **Gather the Values:**\n    *   h (Planck constant) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   k (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   T_ns = 6000 K\n    *   T_s = 5500 K\n\n8.  **Perform the Calculation:** The calculation can be done by plugging in the numbers. Using a computational tool is recommended for accuracy. The Python code below executes this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J*s\nc = 2.99792458e8     # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given values\nT_ns = 6000.0  # Temperature without spots in K\nT_s = 5500.0   # Temperature with spots in K\nlambda_angstrom = 1448.0\nlambda_m = lambda_angstrom * 1e-10  # Wavelength in m\n\n# Calculate the exponent term for the final factor\n# Exponent = (delta_E / k) * (1/T_s - 1/T_ns)\n# where delta_E = h * c / lambda_m\nexponent = (h * c / (lambda_m * k)) * (1/T_s - 1/T_ns)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(factor)\n```\n\nThe output of the code is approximately 4.507.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The calculated factor is ~4.5. This means the ratio of atoms (n₂/n₁) is about 4.5 times higher when the star has no spots (and is hotter) compared to when it has spots (and is cooler). This aligns with the problem statement that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) ~2.9\n    B) ~7.8\n    C) ~4.5\n    D) ~1.1\n    The calculated value matches option C.\n\nThe other information provided in the problem (star's radius, mass, and percentage of spot coverage) is not needed for the calculation, as the initial and final effective temperatures are given directly.\n\n<<<C>>>",
