    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the energy spectrum for the given potential.\n\n1.  **Understand the Potential:**\n    The potential energy of the particle is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation for this potential, it is often easier to work in Cartesian coordinates (x, y), especially when the potential resembles a harmonic oscillator.\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    *   x = r * cos(θ)\n    *   y = r * sin(θ)\n    *   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    We can substitute these into the potential energy expression. Notice that the term `r * cos(θ)` is simply `x`.\n    So, `r^2 * cos^2(θ) = (r * cos(θ))^2 = x^2`.\n    The term `r^2` is `x^2 + y^2`.\n\n    Substituting these into the potential V(r, θ):\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (x^2)\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Now, we combine the terms with x^2 and y^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = ( (1/2 + 3/2) * k * x^2 ) + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = ( (4/2) * k * x^2 ) + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n4.  **Recognize the Form of the Potential:**\n    The potential V(x, y) is now separated into a function of x and a function of y:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where:\n    *   V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\n    *   V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n    This is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The motion in the x and y directions are independent.\n\n5.  **Find the Energy Spectrum for Each Dimension:**\n    The standard potential for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator is V(q) = 1/2 * m * ω^2 * q^2, and its energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) * ħ * ω.\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        We have V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2. Comparing this with V_x(x) = 1/2 * m * ω_x^2 * x^2, we get:\n        1/2 * m * ω_x^2 = 2 * k\n        m * ω_x^2 = 4k\n        ω_x^2 = 4k / m\n        ω_x = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n        The energy levels for the x-oscillator are:\n        E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        We have V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2. Comparing this with V_y(y) = 1/2 * m * ω_y^2 * y^2, we get:\n        1/2 * m * ω_y^2 = 1/2 * k\n        m * ω_y^2 = k\n        ω_y^2 = k / m\n        ω_y = sqrt(k / m)\n        The energy levels for the y-oscillator are:\n        E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Energy:**\n    The total energy E is the sum of the energies for the independent x and y motions:\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n    Now, let's factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k / m):\n    E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    E = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m), where n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...\n    This matches option B.\n\n    A) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    C) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
