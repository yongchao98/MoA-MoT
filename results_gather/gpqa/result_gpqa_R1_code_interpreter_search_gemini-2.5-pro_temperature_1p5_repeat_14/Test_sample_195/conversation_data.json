    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy of the harmonic oscillator is conserved. This means the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy is constant throughout the motion.\n\n2.  **Define the energy components.**\n    *   **Potential Energy (U):** For a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law ($F=-kx$), the potential energy is given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    *   **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (K):** The kinetic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ in special relativity is given by $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the conserved total energy.**\n    The total mechanical energy $E_{total}$ of the system is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy:\n    $E_{total} = K + U(x) = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    This total energy $E_{total}$ remains constant.\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy at two specific points in the motion.**\n    We can equate the total energy at the point of maximum amplitude with the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n\n    *   **At the maximum amplitude ($x = A$):**\n        The mass momentarily stops at the turning point, so its speed is zero ($v=0$).\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The kinetic energy is $K = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        The total energy at this point is $E_{total} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position ($x = 0$):**\n        The mass is moving at its maximum speed ($v = v_{max}$). The potential energy is zero.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The kinetic energy is at its maximum: $K = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n        The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        The total energy at this point is $E_{total} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n5.  **Equate the energies and solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at $x=A$ must equal the total energy at $x=0$:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n6.  **Isolate $\\gamma_{max}$ from the equation.**\n    Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max} - 1$\n    Add 1 to both sides:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n7.  **Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ and solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    We know that $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$. So:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first invert both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Next, square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
