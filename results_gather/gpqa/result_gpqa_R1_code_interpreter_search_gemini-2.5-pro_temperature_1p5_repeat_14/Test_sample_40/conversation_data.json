    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference and Velocities:**\n    This problem involves relativistic velocity addition. We need to define two frames of reference:\n    *   **The Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame, which we consider to be stationary.\n    *   **The Glass Frame (S'):** This is the rest frame of the moving piece of glass. It is moving with a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n\n    Next, we identify the relevant velocities:\n    *   **`v`**: The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the lab (frame S). The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer.\n    *   **`u'`**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the moving glass (frame S'). In any medium with a refractive index `n`, the speed of light is `c/n`. The problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c=1`. Therefore, the speed of the light beam within the glass, as measured in the glass's own frame, is `u' = 1/n`. Since the beam propagates in the same direction as the glass's motion, `u'` has the same sign as `v`.\n    *   **`u`**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory (frame S). This is the value we need to find.\n\n2.  **Apply the Lorentz Velocity Transformation Formula:**\n    The correct formula for adding velocities in special relativity when they are in the same direction is the Einstein velocity addition formula:\n    `u = (v + u') / (1 + (v * u') / c^2)`\n\n3.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    Now, we substitute the values from our problem into this formula:\n    *   `v` = `v`\n    *   `u'` = `1/n`\n    *   `c` = `1`\n\n    The formula becomes:\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + (v * (1/n)) / 1^2)`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Let's simplify the expression for `u`:\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (v + 1/n) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n    Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    *   Numerator: `n*v + n*(1/n) = n*v + 1`\n    *   Denominator: `n*1 + n*(v/n) = n + v`\n\n    So, the final simplified expression is:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    We compare our result with the given choices:\n    A) 1\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    C) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our derived speed `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
