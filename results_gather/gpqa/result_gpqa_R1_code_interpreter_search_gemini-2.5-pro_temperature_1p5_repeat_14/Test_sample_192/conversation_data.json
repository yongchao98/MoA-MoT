    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   We are given an observational relationship: the number of stars (`N`) in a specific region varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. This can be written as a proportionality: `N ∝ plx^{-5}`.\n    *   We need to determine how the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) depends on the distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Interpret the Given Information:**\n    *   The phrase \"the number of stars varies with parallax\" can be ambiguous. It could mean the differential number (the number of stars per unit of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`) or the integral/cumulative number (the number of stars with a parallax greater than `plx`, which we can denote `N(>plx)`).\n    *   In many astronomical contexts, like star counts versus apparent magnitude (`N(m)`), the notation refers to the cumulative number (e.g., number of stars brighter than magnitude `m`). Following this analogy, the most plausible interpretation is that `N` refers to the cumulative number of stars observed, which are those with parallax greater than `plx` (i.e., closer than a certain distance).\n    *   Therefore, we assume: `N(>plx) ∝ plx^{-5}`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance to the star (when distance is measured in parsecs and parallax in arcseconds). The relationship is: `plx = 1/r`.\n\n4.  **Convert the Cumulative Count from Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   We want to find the cumulative number of stars within a distance `r`, denoted as `N(<r)`.\n    *   A star is within distance `r` if its parallax `plx` is greater than `1/r`.\n    *   Therefore, `N(<r)` is equivalent to `N(>plx)` where `plx = 1/r`.\n    *   We can substitute `plx = 1/r` into our initial relationship:\n        `N(<r) ∝ (1/r)^{-5}`\n        `N(<r) ∝ r^5`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars \"per unit range of distance, r\". This is the rate of change of the number of stars with distance, which is the derivative of the cumulative number `N(<r)` with respect to `r`.\n    *   `dN/dr = d/dr [N(<r)]`\n    *   Since `N(<r) ∝ r^5`, we can write `N(<r) = k * r^5` for some constant `k`.\n    *   `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5) = k * 5r^4`\n    *   Therefore, the proportionality for the number of stars per unit range of distance is:\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes in proportion to `r^4`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
