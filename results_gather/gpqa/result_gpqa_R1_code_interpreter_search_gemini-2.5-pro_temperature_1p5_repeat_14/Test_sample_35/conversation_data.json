Light from such a distant object is stretched by the expansion of the universe, a phenomenon known as redshift. This means the observed energy of the absorption line (E_obs = 3.9 * 10^-6 eV) is lower than the energy at which it was emitted in its rest frame (E_rest). We must calculate E_rest to identify the transition.\n\n2.  **Calculate Redshift (z):** The relationship between distance and redshift in cosmology is governed by the Hubble-Lemaître law and cosmological parameters. Using a standard ΛCDM cosmological model (with H₀ ≈ 67.4 km/s/Mpc and Ω_m ≈ 0.315), a distance of 2.1 Gpc corresponds to a redshift of z ≈ 0.49.\n\n3.  **Calculate Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest):** The formula relating observed and rest-frame energy is E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z).\n    *   E_rest = (3.9 * 10^-6 eV) * (1 + 0.4907)\n    *   E_rest ≈ 5.814 * 10^-6 eV\n\n4.  **Identify the Atomic/Molecular Transition:** Now we need to find a common transition in the interstellar medium (ISM) that has an energy of approximately 5.8 * 10^-6 eV.

The small difference is well within the \"about\" precision of the input values. Therefore, the observation is of the 21 cm line from atomic hydrogen.\n\n6.  **Determine the ISM Phase:** The question asks what would be observed in the Milky Way. The 21 cm line originates from atomic hydrogen, so we can eliminate options (C) and (D) which refer to molecular medium. The choice is between the warm (WNM) and cold (CNM) atomic medium.\n    *   The problem specifies an **absorption line**. A 21 cm absorption line occurs when colder foreground HI gas absorbs radio waves from a hotter background source (like a quasar or radio galaxy at 2.1 Gpc).\n    *   This absorption is only significant when the gas is cold, as the absorption strength is proportional to 1/T_spin, where T_spin is the spin temperature of the hydrogen. The spin temperature is closely coupled to the kinetic temperature of the gas.\n    *   The Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) has temperatures of ~50-100 K and produces strong 21 cm absorption lines. The Warm Neutral Medium (WNM), with temperatures of ~6000-10000 K, is too hot to produce significant absorption.\n    *   Therefore, a detected 21 cm absorption line is a classic tracer of the **Cold atomic interstellar medium**.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An absorption line from a distant astronomical object is observed. We need to identify the medium in the Milky Way that would produce an equivalent absorption line.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the transition from the observed energy\n\nThe observed absorption line has an energy of `E_obs = 3.9 x 10^-6 eV`. This light has traveled from a source at a distance of 2.1 Gpc. Due to the expansion of the universe, this light is redshifted, meaning its observed energy is lower than the energy at which it was emitted (its rest-frame energy, `E_rest`).\n\nThe relationship between these energies is given by `E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)`, where `z` is the redshift.\n\nTo find the rest-frame energy, we first need to estimate the redshift `z` corresponding to a distance of 2.1 Gpc (2100 Mpc). A simplified version of the Hubble-Lemaître law, which works well for estimations, is `v ≈ H₀ * D`, where `v` is the recessional velocity, `D` is the distance, and `H₀` is the Hubble constant (approximately 70 km/s/Mpc). For low to moderate redshifts, `z ≈ v/c` where `c` is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n\n1.  Calculate recessional velocity `v`:\n    `v ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc * 2100 Mpc = 147,000 km/s`\n2.  Calculate redshift `z`:\n    `z ≈ 147,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.49`\n\nNow, we can calculate the rest-frame energy `E_rest`:\n`E_rest ≈ (3.9 * 10^-6 eV) * (1 + 0.49) = 3.9 * 10^-6 eV * 1.49 ≈ 5.81 * 10^-6 eV`\n\n### Step 2: Match the rest-frame energy to a known spectral line\n\nWe look for a common spectral line in the interstellar medium with an energy of approximately `5.8 * 10^-6 eV`.\n\nThe most famous low-energy transition in radio astronomy is the hyperfine transition of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI), known as the **21 cm line**. Let's calculate its energy:\n*   Frequency of the 21 cm line (ν) = 1420.40575 MHz = 1.4204 x 10⁹ Hz\n*   Planck's constant (h) ≈ 4.136 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s\n*   Energy (E) = hν = (4.136 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s) * (1.4204 x 10⁹ Hz) ≈ **5.87 x 10⁻⁶ eV**\n\nThis calculated energy of the 21 cm line matches our derived rest-frame energy almost perfectly. This confirms that the observed absorption is due to the 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the state of the atomic hydrogen\n\nThe question asks what would be observed with this absorption line in the Milky Way. Since the line is from atomic hydrogen, we can eliminate the \"molecular\" options (C and D). We must now choose between the warm and cold phases of the atomic interstellar medium.\n\n*   An **absorption line** is created when cooler gas lies in front of a hotter background source. The strength of the 21 cm absorption line is inversely proportional to the temperature of the absorbing hydrogen gas.\n*   The **Cold atomic interstellar medium** (also called Cold Neutral Medium, or CNM) has temperatures around 50-100 Kelvin. At these low temperatures, it is an effective absorber of 21 cm radiation, producing strong absorption lines.\n*   The **Warm atomic interstellar medium** (Warm Neutral Medium, or WNM) has temperatures around 6000-8000 K. Due to its high temperature, its 21 cm absorption signature is extremely weak and generally undetectable. The WNM is typically observed via its faint 21 cm *emission*, not absorption.\n\nTherefore, the observation of a 21 cm absorption line is a classic tracer for the **cold atomic interstellar medium**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
