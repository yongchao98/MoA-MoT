    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species and equilibria:**\n    In a solution of Co(II) and thiocyanate (SCN⁻), a series of complexation reactions occur, forming different cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. The species present are the free hydrated cobalt ion, [Co(H₂O)₆]²⁺ (which we'll denote as Co²⁺), and the complexes [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.\n\n    The formation of these complexes is governed by the following equilibria, defined by their overall stability constants (βn):\n    *   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ; β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n    *   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ; β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n    *   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n    *   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n3.  **Express species concentrations in terms of [Co²⁺]:**\n    Using the stability constants, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺] and the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻]:\n    *   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n    Substituting these into the equation for c(Co):\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n4.  **Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (α₂):**\n    We want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂]. This is given by the fraction of this species (α₂) multiplied by 100.\n    α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\n    Substituting the expressions from step 3:\n    α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\n    The [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leaving:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n5.  **Approximate the free ligand concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt is c(Co) = 10⁻² M (or 0.01 M), and the total concentration of thiocyanate is 0.1 M. Since the thiocyanate concentration is ten times larger than the cobalt concentration, it is in excess. We can approximate that the concentration of free thiocyanate, [SCN⁻], is equal to its total initial concentration.\n    [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\n6.  **Calculate the value of α₂:**\n    Now, we substitute the known values into the equation for α₂.\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    **Numerator:**\n    β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n    **Denominator:**\n    1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\n    = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\n    = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\n    = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\n    = 2.3646\n\n    **Fraction α₂:**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n7.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = α₂ * 100%\n    Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%\n\n    This value is approximately 16.9%.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a Python script for the calculation.\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Ligand concentration\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Numerator for the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\n# Denominator (related to the sum of all species)\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the complex\nfraction_alpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = fraction_alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<execute_code>\n16.91618032648228\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a chemistry problem regarding complex ion equilibria.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe main objective is to calculate the percentage of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information:**\n*   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M.\n*   Total thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]total = 0.1 M.\n*   Overall stability constants for the formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes:\n    *   β₁ for [Co(SCN)]⁺ is 9.\n    *   β₂ for [Co(SCN)₂] is 40.\n    *   β₃ for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ is 63.\n    *   β₄ for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ is 16.\n*   The species of interest is the \"dithiocyanato cobalt(II)\" complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂].\n\n**3. Formulate the Chemical Equations and Equilibrium Expressions:**\nThe formation of the complexes can be represented by the following equilibria:\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺  -->  β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻])\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]  -->  β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²)\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻  --> β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³)\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻  --> β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Define the Total Concentration of Cobalt:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**5. Express All Species Concentrations in Terms of a Common Variable:**\nIt's convenient to express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free metal ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the free ligand concentration, [SCN⁻].\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for c(Co):\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + (β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) + (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) + (β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) + (β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**6. Define the Mole Fraction (α) of the Desired Species:**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]. This percentage is 100 times the mole fraction (α₂) of this species.\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nSubstitute the expressions from step 5:\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / [ [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ]\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term appears in both the numerator and denominator, so it cancels out:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**7. Handle the Free Ligand Concentration [SCN⁻]:**\nThe problem gives the *total* concentration of thiocyanate as 0.1 M. Some of this will be bound to cobalt. However, the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M) is significantly less than the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). This means the ligand is in large excess.\nLet's check the maximum amount of SCN⁻ that could be consumed: if all cobalt formed the [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ complex, it would consume 4 * 0.01 M = 0.04 M of SCN⁻. This is a significant fraction of the initial 0.1 M.\nHowever, in these types of problems, especially multiple-choice ones, it is standard practice to make an initial approximation that the free ligand concentration is equal to the total ligand concentration, especially when it's in excess.\nApproximation: [SCN⁻] ≈ [SCN⁻]total = 0.1 M.\nThis approximation is valid because the concentration of the ligand is 10 times higher than that of the metal ion.\n\n**8. Perform the Calculation:**\nNow, plug the numerical values into the equation for α₂:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nCalculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   1 = 1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nSum of the denominator terms (let's call it D):\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator term (N) is β₂[SCN⁻]²:\nN = 0.4\n\nCalculate α₂:\nα₂ = N / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nCalculate the percentage:\nPercentage = α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%\n\n**9. Compare with Options:**\nThe calculated value is 16.916%.\nThe given options are:\nA) 16.9%\nB) 42.3%\nC) 38.1%\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe calculated value matches option A very closely.\n\nThe provided Python code execution confirms this calculation.\n`print(percentage)` yielded `16.916180326482287`, which rounds to 16.9%.\n\nThe logic is sound, the calculation is verified, and the result matches one of the options. The final answer should be A. To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we first need to calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Define the Species and Equilibria**\nThe cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes:\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (βn):\n*   β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n*   β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n*   β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n*   β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n**2. Formulate the Mole Fraction (α₂) Expression**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of [Co²⁺] and [SCN⁻] using the stability constants:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (α₂) is the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂] divided by the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nBy canceling [Co²⁺] from the numerator and denominator, we get:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Approximate the Free Ligand Concentration**\nThe total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the total thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. Since the thiocyanate is in a 10-fold excess, the amount of SCN⁻ that complexes with Co²⁺ is relatively small compared to its total concentration. Therefore, we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻] as its initial total concentration:\n[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\n**4. Calculate the Fraction α₂**\nNow, substitute the known values into the expression for α₂:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nNumerator = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nDenominator = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nDenominator = 2.3646\n\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**5. Convert to Percentage**\nTo find the percentage of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex, multiply the fraction α₂ by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
