    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule given by the condensed formula: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\nLet's break down the formula to count the atoms and bonds:\n*   The main carbon chain can be traced as: `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`. This is a 7-carbon chain.\n*   Let's count the total number of carbon (C) atoms:\n    *   `(CH3)2C=`: 1 carbon in the chain and 2 in the methyl (CH3) groups = 3 carbons.\n    *   `=CH-`: 1 carbon.\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 carbon.\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 carbon in the chain and 1 in the methyl group = 2 carbons.\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 carbon.\n    *   `-CH=`: 1 carbon.\n    *   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 carbon in the chain and 2 in the methyl groups = 3 carbons.\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12 carbon atoms**.\n*   Let's count the total number of hydrogen (H) atoms:\n    *   `(CH3)2`: 2 * 3 = 6 hydrogens.\n    *   `CH`: 1 hydrogen.\n    *   `CH2`: 2 hydrogens.\n    *   `CH(CH3)`: 1 + 3 = 4 hydrogens.\n    *   `CH2`: 2 hydrogens.\n    *   `CH`: 1 hydrogen.\n    *   `(CH3)2`: 2 * 3 = 6 hydrogens.\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 hydrogen atoms**.\n*   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nNow, we count the bonds within the molecule:\n*   **C=C double bonds**: There are two double bonds in the structure, `(CH3)2C=CH` and `CH=C(CH3)2`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-H single bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds**:\n    *   Bonds from the first `C` to its two `CH3` groups: 2\n    *   Bond between `=CH-` and `-CH2-`: 1\n    *   Bond between `-CH2-` and `-CH(CH3)-`: 1\n    *   Bond from the `CH` to its `CH3` group: 1\n    *   Bond between `-CH(CH3)-` and `-CH2-`: 1\n    *   Bond between `-CH2-` and `-CH=`: 1\n    *   Bonds from the last `C` to its two `CH3` groups: 2\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements (Reactants)**\n\nThe formation of the compound C12H22 is from its elements in their standard states:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is calculated using the formula:\nΔHf = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Total bond energy of the product]\n\n*   **Enthalpy of atomization of reactants**: This is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states into gaseous atoms.\n    *   Reactants are 12 moles of C(s) and 11 moles of H2(g).\n    *   Atomization of 12 moles of Carbon: 12 * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 * 1000 kJ = 12000 kJ.\n    *   Atomization of 11 moles of H2: This involves breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n        *   Energy = 11 * BE(H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ = 1100 kJ.\n    *   Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\n*   **Total bond energy of C12H22**: This is the energy released when the gaseous atoms combine to form the molecule. It is the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule.\n    *   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol.\n    *   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol.\n    *   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol.\n    *   Total bond energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\n*   ΔHf = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Total bond energy of the product]\n*   ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Convert the Units to Match the Options**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g. Our calculated value (1900 kJ/mol) does not match the numerical part of options A or B. Option C has the number 1900 but in units of kJ/g, which would be an extremely high value. Let's convert our result to kJ/g and compare it with option D.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22**:\n    *   M = (12 * Atomic Mass of C) + (22 * Atomic Mass of H)\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (consistent with the simple given data): M = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Enthalpy of Formation in kJ/g**:\n    *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nH_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nBE_HH = 100      # kJ/mol\nBE_CC = 200      # kJ/mol\nBE_C_eq_C = 300  # kJ/mol, C=C\nBE_CH = 400      # kJ/mol\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Count atoms and bonds for (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\nnum_C_atoms = 12\nnum_H_atoms = 22\nnum_CC_bonds = 9\nnum_C_eq_C_bonds = 2\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of reactants (12 C(s) and 11 H2(g))\n# Energy to form 12 C(g)\nH_atom_reactants_C = num_C_atoms * H_atom_C\n# Energy to form 22 H(g) from 11 H2(g)\nH_atom_reactants_H = (num_H_atoms / 2) * BE_HH\n# Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants\nH_atom_reactants_total = H_atom_reactants_C + H_atom_reactants_H\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total bond energy of the product molecule C12H22\ntotal_bond_energy_product = (num_CC_bonds * BE_CC) + \\\n                             (num_C_eq_C_bonds * BE_C_eq_C) + \\\n                             (num_CH_bonds * BE_CH)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\ndelta_Hf_mol = H_atom_reactants_total - total_bond_energy_product\n\n# Step 6: Convert to kJ/g\nmolar_mass_C12H22 = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1)  # g/mol\ndelta_Hf_g = delta_Hf_mol / molar_mass_C12H22\n\nprint(f\"Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants: {H_atom_reactants_total} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Total bond energy of the product: {total_bond_energy_product} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation: {delta_Hf_mol} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Molar mass: {molar_mass_C12H22} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation: {delta_Hf_g} kJ/g\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
