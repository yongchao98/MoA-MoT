    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Particle Decay**\n\nThe decay of a population of unstable particles is described by the exponential decay law:\nN(t') = N₀ * exp(-t' / τ)\n\nwhere:\n*   `N(t')` is the number of particles remaining after a time `t'`.\n*   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n*   `τ` (tau) is the *proper mean lifetime* of the particle. This is the lifetime measured in the particle's own reference frame.\n*   `t'` is the time elapsed in the particle's reference frame (the proper time).\n\n**2. Apply Time Dilation**\n\nThe detector is in the \"lab frame,\" and the particles are moving. Due to time dilation, the time `t` that passes in the lab frame is longer than the time `t'` that passes for the particle. The relationship is:\nt' = t / γ\n\nwhere `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**3. Set up the Equations for the Scenario**\n\nThe time `t` it takes for a particle to travel the radius `R` of the detector in the lab frame is:\nt = R / v\n\nSince the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. So we can approximate `v ≈ c`.\nt ≈ R / c\n\nNow, substitute this into the time dilation formula to find the proper time `t'` experienced by the particle:\nt' ≈ (R / c) / γ = R / (γc)\n\nWe can now plug this proper time `t'` into the decay equation to find the fraction of particles (`N/N₀`) that reach the detector wall:\nN/N₀ = exp( - (R / (γc)) / τ )\nN/N₀ = exp( -R / (γcτ) )\n\nThe term `R/(cτ)` is a constant for this specific particle type and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`.\nK = R / (cτ)\n\nSo the simplified equation is:\nN/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)\n\n**4. Use the Initial Conditions to Find the Constant K**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the wall, N/N₀ = 1/3\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n\nPlug these values into our equation:\n1/3 = exp(-K / 20)\n\nTo solve for K, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -K / 20\n-ln(3) = -K / 20\nK = 20 * ln(3)\n\n**5. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n\nNow we want to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂, required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the wall.\n*   New fraction, N/N₀ = 2/3\n*   New Lorentz factor, γ₂ = ?\n\nUsing the same equation with the new values and the constant K we just found:\n2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -K / γ₂\n-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂\nln(3/2) = K / γ₂\n\nNow, solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = K / ln(3/2)\n\nSubstitute the expression for K that we found in step 4:\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Value**\nLet's compute the numerical value for γ₂.\n```python\nimport math\n\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_code>\n54.18843944621539\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.\n\n**7. Compare with the Options**\nA) 40\nB) 54\nC) 68\nD) 28\n\nThe calculated value of ~54.2 is very close to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem deals with the decay of relativistic particles. The key concept is time dilation, which affects the observed lifetime of a moving particle. The decay process follows an exponential law.\n\n2.  **Formulate the decay equation:** The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that have not decayed after a time `t'` in their own reference frame (proper time) is given by:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-t' / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n3.  **Relate lab time and proper time:** Due to time dilation, the time `t` measured in the lab frame is related to the proper time `t'` by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `t' = t / γ`\n\n4.  **Determine the lab time `t`:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is:\n    `t = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n5.  **Combine the equations:** Substitute the expressions for `t` and `t'` into the decay equation:\n    `t' ≈ (R / c) / γ = R / (γc)`\n    So, the fraction of particles reaching the detector wall is:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\n6.  **Use the initial condition to find the constant term:** The term `R/(cτ)` is a constant for this experiment, as it depends only on the detector size and the type of particle. Let's call this constant `K = R/(cτ)`.\n    The survival fraction is now `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\n    We are given that when `γ₁ = 20`, the survival fraction `N/N₀ = 1/3`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n7.  **Solve for the new Lorentz factor `γ₂`:** Now we need to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which the survival fraction is `N/N₀ = 2/3`. We use the same formula with the value of `K` we just found.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `ln(2) - ln(3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -K / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n\n    Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the final value:** Substitute the expression for `K` from step 6 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n    Using the provided code output for this calculation:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n9.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) 40\n    B) 54\n    C) 68\n    D) 28\n\n    The calculated value of approximately 54.2 is closest to the option 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
