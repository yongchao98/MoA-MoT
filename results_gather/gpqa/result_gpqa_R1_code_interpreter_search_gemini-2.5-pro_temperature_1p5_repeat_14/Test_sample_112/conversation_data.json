    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of carboxylic acids (-COOH).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. A C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically found around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence confirms the conclusion from the FTIR data that the molecule contains an alkene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragmentation peak. The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as: 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45. The presence of this fragment provides very strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined spectroscopic evidence points unequivocally to a molecule that is an **alkenoic acid** (a compound containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) requires **two** oxygen atoms. This immediately rules out options A (C6H10O) and C (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: B (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2).\n    *   The presence of a C=C bond (one degree of unsaturation) and a C=O bond (another degree of unsaturation) means the correct molecule must have a total of at least **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n        *   **For D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This compound has only one degree of unsaturation, which would be the C=O of the carboxylic acid. It is a saturated molecule (e.g., hexanoic acid) and does not have a C=C bond, contradicting the FTIR and NMR data.\n        *   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This compound has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accounts for one C=O bond in the carboxylic acid and one C=C bond of the alkene.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data (carboxylic acid, alkene, and m/z=45 fragment) is C6H10O2.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_compound(formula):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a chemical formula based on the problem's spectroscopic data.\n    Prints the Degree of Unsaturation and whether it's a plausible candidate.\n    \"\"\"\n    import re\n    \n    # Extract atom counts from the formula string\n    atoms = {'C': 0, 'H': 0, 'O': 0}\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    for element, count in parts:\n        atoms[element] = int(count) if count else 1\n\n    C = atoms['C']\n    H = atoms['H']\n    O = atoms['O']\n\n    # Calculate Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n    # DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.

    "The analysis of the spectroscopic data is as follows:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically one found in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for vinyl-hydrogens directly confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) functional group.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at an m/z ratio of 45 is a classic indicator of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺. The mass of COOH is (12 + 16 + 16 + 1) = 45.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\nThe combined data indicates that the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid** (a molecule containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given molecular formulas:\n\n*   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) requires **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options A (C6H10O) and C (C6H12O).\n*   We are left with B (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2). To distinguish between them, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   A carboxylic acid's C=O bond counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   An alkene's C=C bond counts as another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, our target molecule must have **at least two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **For D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This molecule has only one degree of unsaturation. It could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it cannot have the C=C double bond confirmed by the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n*   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This molecule has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accounts for one C=O bond (from the acid) and one C=C bond (from the alkene).\n\nOnly the formula C6H10O2 is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence.\n\n<<<B>>>"
