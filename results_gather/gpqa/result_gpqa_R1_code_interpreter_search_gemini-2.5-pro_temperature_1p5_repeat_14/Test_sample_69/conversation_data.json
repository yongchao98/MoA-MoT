    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the simple gases and the solvent.**\n\nThe last clue is the simplest reaction: \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\n*   B and D are gases. H is a solvent.\n*   Many common laboratory gases exist (H₂, N₂, O₂, Cl₂, CO, etc.).\n*   A well-known 1:1 reaction between two common gases that produces a liquid/solvent is the synthesis of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas.\n    *   **D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent)**\n    *   **CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l/g)** (Phosgene)\n*   Phosgene (COCl₂) is indeed used as a solvent in some contexts and is a liquid at room temperature (boiling point 8 °C).\n*   Let's assign:\n    *   **B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)**\n    *   **D = CO (Carbon Monoxide)**\n    *   **H = COCl₂ (Phosgene)**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the hydrolysis reaction.**\n\nThe third clue is: \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"\n*   **C + H₂O → A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)**\n*   Since C is formed from a reaction involving chlorine (B = Cl₂), it is a chloride-containing compound. Its hydrolysis would naturally produce hydrochloric acid.\n*   Therefore, the strong acid **F is HCl**.\n*   The reaction must also produce a weak acid, G, and regenerate the initial solid reactant, A. This regeneration of A is a very strong clue, suggesting a disproportionation reaction upon hydrolysis.\n\n**Step 3: Attempt to identify A and C.**\n\nThis is the most challenging part, with seemingly contradictory information. Let's analyze the first clue: \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C\". With B = Cl₂, this is **A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C(red, solid)**.\n\nLet's test a hypothesis based on known chemistry that fits the hydrolysis step.\n*   Consider the element **Iodine (A = I₂) **, which is a solid.\n*   Iodine reacts with chlorine to form iodine trichloride (ICl₃), which exists as a dimer, I₂Cl₆. The reaction is **I₂(s) + 3Cl₂(g) → I₂Cl₆(s)**.\n*   Hydrolysis of iodine trichloride is a known disproportionation reaction:\n    **5ICl₃ + 9H₂O → I₂(s) + 15HCl(aq) + 3HIO₃(aq)**\n*   Let's check this against our clues:\n    *   **A = I₂** is regenerated.\n    *   **F = HCl** (a strong acid) is produced.\n    *   **G = HIO₃** (iodic acid) is produced. Iodic acid (pKa ≈ 0.75) is significantly weaker than HCl. This fits the \"weak acid\" description in the context of being compared to a very strong one.\n*   This hypothesis for A, C, F, and G is chemically sound and fits the hydrolysis reaction perfectly.\n*   However, there are two discrepancies with the problem statement:\n    1.  **Stoichiometry**: The reaction requires 3 equivalents of Cl₂ per I₂, not 8. (1:3 ratio, not 1:8).\n    2.  **Color**: I₂Cl₆ is a bright yellow solid, not red.\n\nDespite these discrepancies, which might be errors in the puzzle's text, this chemical system is a very strong candidate. Let's proceed with it to identify E.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the hazardous product E.**\n\nThe second clue is: \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E\".\n*   Substituting our identified compounds: **C + 2CO → E**\n*   With C = I₂Cl₆ (or 2ICl₃), the reaction is: **I₂Cl₆ + 2CO → E**\n*   CO is a good reducing agent and can also react with chlorides to form phosgene. A plausible reaction is a reductive carbonylation:\n    **I₂Cl₆ + 2CO → 2ICl + 2COCl₂**\n*   In this reaction, the product **E is COCl₂ (phosgene)**.\n*   Is phosgene \"extremely hazardous\"? Yes, it is a potent poison and was used as a chemical warfare agent. This fits the description.\n*   The stoichiometry also works if we consider that one C (I₂Cl₆) reacts with 2 CO.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\nWe have identified **E = COCl₂ (phosgene)**. Now we must find its point group.\n\n1.  **Draw the molecule:** Phosgene has a central carbon atom, double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. The molecule is planar due to the sp² hybridization of the carbon.\n    ```\n        O\n        ||\n    C\n    /   \\\n    Cl   Cl\n    ```\n2.  **Identify the symmetry elements:**\n    *   **E**: The identity element (all molecules have this).\n    *   **C₂ axis**: There is one two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the C=O bond. Rotating 180° about this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    *   **σᵥ mirror plane**: There is a mirror plane perpendicular to the plane of the molecule that contains the C₂ axis and bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n    *   **σᵥ' mirror plane**: The plane containing all four atoms (the molecular plane) is also a plane of symmetry.\n\n3.  **Assign the Point Group:** The set of symmetry elements {E, C₂, σᵥ, σᵥ'} corresponds to the **C2v** point group.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n*Self-consistency check: Notice that both H (the solvent) and E (the hazardous product) were identified as phosgene (COCl₂). This is perfectly allowable within the puzzle's constraints and adds to the confidence in the identification.*\n\n<<<C>>>"
