    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition Process:**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ occurring via a cascade of two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state, and the decay happens in two steps:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply E1 Selection Rules for the First Transition:**\n    The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta n = n' - n$ can be any integer.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n    For the first step, the initial state is $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l' - 0 = \\pm 1$, which means the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, so the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. In a hydrogen atom, we must have $l' < n'$. Since $l'=1$, we need $n' \\ge 2$. Combining these conditions, the only possible value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$.\n\n    Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply E1 Selection Rules for the Second Transition:**\n    The second step is the transition from an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This condition must be satisfied.\n        *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$ (allowed).\n        *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$ (allowed).\n        *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$ (allowed).\n    So, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Furthermore, for a state in the $n=2, l=1$ manifold (the $2p$ level), the only possible E1 decay channel is to the $n=1, l=0$ state (the $1s$ ground state). This means that once the atom reaches any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability (or branching ratio) of 1.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Branching Ratios for the First Transition:**\n    The overall probability for a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, i.e., the probability of the atom in the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying into a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    The probability of a transition from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\vec{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d} = -e\\vec{r}$.\n\n    The branching ratio for the decay into a specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n    $B(m') = \\frac{|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\vec{d} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2}{\\sum_{m''=-1,0,1} |\\langle 2,1,m'' | \\vec{d} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2}$\n\n    We need to compare the magnitudes of the matrix elements for $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has a spherically symmetric wavefunction ($Y_{0,0}$ is a constant).\n    *   The electric dipole interaction, when averaged over all possible polarizations and directions of the emitted photon, is isotropic.\n    *   Therefore, there can be no preferred final state $m'$. The decay must populate the three possible final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ with equal probability.\n\n    More formally, using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the matrix element squared is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $|\\langle 2,1,m' | d_q^{(1)} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle|^2$.\n    This coefficient is non-zero only for $q=m'$, and its value is $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle = 1$ for all $m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n    This confirms that the transition rates to each of the three $m'$ sublevels are equal.\n\n    Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first decay step, the branching ratio for each is $1/3$.\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Probability for Each Route:**\n    The total probability of a cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **Route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$**: $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   **Route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$**: $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   **Route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$**: $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,-1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Probability is incorrect)\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Route and probability are correct)\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Probability is incorrect)\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Probability is incorrect)\n\n    Only option B presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<B>>>"
