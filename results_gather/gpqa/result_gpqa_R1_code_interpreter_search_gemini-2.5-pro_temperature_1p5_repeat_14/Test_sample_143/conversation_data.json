    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n1.  The mean decay distance, $L$, in the lab frame is the distance the particle travels, on average, before it decays. This is related to its mean proper lifetime, $\\tau$, and its velocity in the lab frame.\n2.  The mean proper lifetime, $\\tau$, is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. It is related to the decay width, $\\Gamma$, by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n3.  In the lab frame, due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime is longer by a factor of $\\gamma$, the Lorentz factor. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is $\\gamma\\tau$.\n4.  The distance the particle travels during this time is its velocity, $v$, multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime:\n    $L = v \\cdot (\\gamma\\tau) = \\gamma v \\tau$\n5.  It is often convenient to work with the quantity $\\beta = v/c$, where $c$ is the speed of light. So, $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$.\n6.  The term $c\\tau$ is the mean proper decay length, i.e., the distance light would travel in one proper lifetime. We can calculate it as:\n    $c\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n7.  The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ and the velocity factor $\\beta$ can be calculated from the particle's total energy, $E$, and mass, $m$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{mc^2}$\n    In high-energy physics, we use natural units where $c=1$, so $\\gamma = E/m$.\n    The momentum, $p$, is related to energy and mass by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    The factor $\\gamma \\beta$ can be expressed as:\n    $\\gamma \\beta = \\gamma \\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{E}{mc^2} \\frac{pc}{E} = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$\n    In natural units ($c=1$), this simplifies to $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{p}{m} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - m^2}}{m}$.\n8.  Putting it all together, the mean decay distance is:\n    $L = (\\gamma \\beta) \\cdot (c\\tau) = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - m^2}}{m} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $E = E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m = m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $\\Gamma = \\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV} = 0.320 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nWe use the standard value for the physical constant $\\hbar c$:\n*   $\\hbar c \\approx 1.97327 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ GeV m}$\n\nLet's perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE_X = 8.0  # GeV\nm_X = 1.2  # GeV\nGamma_X_MeV = 320.0  # MeV\n\n# Convert Gamma to GeV\nGamma_X_GeV = Gamma_X_MeV / 1000.0\n\n# Constants\n# hbar * c in GeV*m\nhbar_c_GeV_m = 1.973269804e-16\n\n# Calculate the momentum-mass ratio (which is equal to gamma*beta)\n# pc = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) in units where c=1\npc = np.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X**2)\np_over_m = pc / m_X\n\n# Calculate the proper decay length (c*tau)\nctau = hbar_c_GeV_m / Gamma_X_GeV\n\n# Calculate the mean decay distance in the lab frame\nL = p_over_m * ctau\n\nprint(f\"{L=}\")\nprint(f\"Option C: {4.0655 * 10**-15}\")\n```\nL=4.064579294270119e-15\nOption C: 4.0655e-15\n\nThe calculated value is $L = 4.06458 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$.\nLet's compare this to the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nB) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nC) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to option C.

    "The user has asked for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance ($L$) of the particle X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Concepts:**\n    *   **Proper Lifetime:** The mean lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame ($\\tau$) is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n        $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n        where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** In the laboratory frame, where the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. The lab-frame lifetime is $\\gamma\\tau$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Mean Decay Distance:** The distance a particle travels on average before decaying is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime.\n        $L = v \\cdot (\\gamma\\tau) = \\gamma v \\tau$\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation Strategy:**\n    *   It is more convenient to use the dimensionless velocity $\\beta = v/c$ and the combination $\\gamma\\beta$. The formula becomes:\n        $L = c \\beta \\gamma \\tau$\n    *   We can group the terms as $L = (\\gamma\\beta) \\cdot (c\\tau)$.\n    *   The first term, $\\gamma\\beta$, can be calculated from the particle's energy ($E$) and mass ($m$). In units where $c=1$ (common in high-energy physics), we have:\n        *   $E = \\gamma m$\n        *   The momentum is $p = \\gamma m \\beta$.\n        *   Therefore, $\\gamma\\beta = p/m$.\n        *   Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = p^2 + m^2$, we can find $p = \\sqrt{E^2 - m^2}$.\n        *   So, $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - m^2}}{m}$.\n    *   The second term, $c\\tau$, is the mean proper decay length. Using the relation for $\\tau$:\n        $c\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n    *   Combining these gives the final formula for the mean decay distance:\n        $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - m^2}}{m} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n4.  **Gather the Given Values and Constants:**\n    *   Production Energy: $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   Mass: $m_X = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   Width: $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   Physical Constant: $\\hbar c \\approx 1.97327 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}$\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation (as verified by the code):**\n    *   Calculate the $\\gamma\\beta$ factor:\n        $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{(8 \\, \\text{GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\, \\text{GeV})^2}}{1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{64 - 1.44}}{1.2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56}}{1.2} \\approx 6.5912$\n    *   Calculate the proper decay length $c\\tau$:\n        $c\\tau = \\frac{1.97327 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}}{0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\approx 6.1665 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m}$\n    *   Calculate the mean decay distance $L$:\n        $L = (\\gamma\\beta) \\cdot (c\\tau) \\approx 6.5912 \\times 6.1665 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m} \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n6.  **Compare the Result with the Options:**\n    *   Calculated result: $L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n    *   Option A: $5.0223 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n    *   Option B: $5.0223 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m}$\n    *   Option C: $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n    *   Option D: $4.0655 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n    The calculated value is extremely close to Option C. The small discrepancy (about 0.025%) is likely due to using a slightly different value for the constant $\\hbar c$ when the problem options were created. Therefore, C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
