    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   This is a classic cyanohydrin formation reaction. The reactants are a ketone (butan-2-one) and a source of cyanide ions (NaCN).\n    *   The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) on the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin product.\n    *   Reagent 'A' must be a source of protons (H⁺). The reaction is typically carried out by adding a small amount of acid to a solution of NaCN to generate HCN *in situ*, or by adding an acid during the workup step. In the context of this question, 'A' represents the necessary proton source.\n    *   Looking at the options for A, H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion) represents an acidic aqueous solution, which serves as the required proton source. NaHSO₃ is sodium bisulfite, which would lead to a different type of addition product and is not used for cyanohydrin formation in this manner.\n    *   Therefore, A = H₃O⁺ is the correct choice.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be performed under either strongly acidic or strongly basic conditions, typically with heating. The presence of H₂O in the reaction indicates that it's a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   Reagent 'B' acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   Looking at the options for B, we have HCl (a strong acid) and CH₃COOH (a weak acid).\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis is a slow reaction that requires harsh conditions. A strong acid like HCl is necessary to effectively catalyze the reaction by protonating the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon atom more electrophilic and susceptible to attack by water. A weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is generally not strong enough to catalyze this hydrolysis efficiently.\n    *   Therefore, B = HCl is the appropriate reagent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, reagent A should be H₃O⁺ and reagent B should be HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
