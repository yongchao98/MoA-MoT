    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity. A charge `+q` is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field `E` at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:**\n    *   The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges in the conductor. A total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity). This is a consequence of Gauss's Law: if you draw a Gaussian surface inside the conducting material, enclosing the cavity, the electric field must be zero everywhere on that surface. This implies the net charge enclosed is zero, so the induced charge on the inner wall must be `-q` to cancel the `+q` inside.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain overall charge neutrality, since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    *   A key property of conductors is that they act as electrostatic shields. The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is determined *only* by the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor. The internal charges (the original charge `+q` in the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall) are shielded. Their net electric field outside the conductor is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the electric field produced by the charge `+q` residing on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   The charge `+q` on the outer surface will spread out to reach an equilibrium distribution. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the surface. This is because a uniform distribution ensures that the surface is an equipotential, a necessary condition for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field (Shell Theorem):**\n    *   According to the shell theorem (which can be derived from Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, we have a total charge `+q` distributed uniformly on a spherical surface of radius `R`.\n    *   The point P is located at a distance `L` from the center of this sphere (`L > R`).\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at the center of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Final Formula:**\n    *   The magnitude of the electric field from a point charge `q` at a distance `L` is given by Coulomb's Law:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The details about the cavity's size (`r`), its position (`s`), and the relative position of the point P with respect to the cavity (`l`, `Î¸`) are irrelevant for calculating the field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect. The external field only depends on the total charge (`+q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor (`L`).\n    *   Comparing our result with the given options, option A matches perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
