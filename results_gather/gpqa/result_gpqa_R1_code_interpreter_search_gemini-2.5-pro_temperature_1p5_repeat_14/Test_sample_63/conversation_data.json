    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes, and we analyze the change in mass of each tube to identify the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This means the mass of water produced is m(H₂O) = 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of water (H₂O) is M ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of water: n(H₂O) = m / M = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc.\n    *   The weight did not change. This indicates that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition. Therefore, the salts A and B do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The increase in mass is due to the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass increase = 0.80 g. This means the mass of oxygen produced is m(O₂) = 0.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of oxygen gas (O₂) is M = 32 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen: n(O₂) = m / M = 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, a gas remains that did not react with a desiccant, a base, or hot copper. This suggests it's a relatively inert gas.\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C: n(C) = V / V_m = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the elements likely present in salts that decompose this way, Gas C is almost certainly nitrogen gas (N₂), which is inert under these conditions. So, n(N₂) = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nThe products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the original salts A and B must be composed of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). Let's calculate the total mass of each element from the products.\n\n*   **Mass of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   n(H) = 2 * n(H₂O) = 2 * 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   m(H) = 0.40 mol * 1 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n\n*   **Mass of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   n(N) = 2 * n(N₂) = 2 * 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   m(N) = 0.20 mol * 14 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n\n*   **Mass of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂.\n    *   n(O) = 1 * n(H₂O) + 2 * n(O₂) = 0.20 mol + 2 * 0.025 mol = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   m(O) = 0.25 mol * 16 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\nLet's check the total mass: m(total) = m(H) + m(N) + m(O) = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming our analysis of the products is correct.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, containing N, H, and O. Common salts with these elements that decompose upon heating are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, like ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). Let's test this hypothesis.\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** Salt A is NH₄NO₃ and Salt B is NH₄NO₂.\n*   **Decomposition reactions:**\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)  *(This pathway for ammonium nitrate decomposition fits the products O₂ and N₂)*\n\nThe mixture is equimolar, so let `n` be the number of moles of each salt.\n\n*   **Products from `n` mol of NH₄NO₂ (Salt B):**\n    *   `n` mol of N₂ and `2n` mol of H₂O.\n*   **Products from `n` mol of NH₄NO₃ (Salt A):**\n    *   Based on the stoichiometry (2:2:1:4), `n` mol of NH₄NO₃ will produce `n` mol of N₂, `n/2` mol of O₂, and `2n` mol of H₂O.\n\n**Total moles of products from the mixture:**\n*   Total n(N₂) = `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n`\n*   Total n(O₂) = `n/2` (from A) + 0 (from B) = `n/2`\n*   Total n(H₂O) = `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n`\n\nNow, we match these with the moles we calculated from the experiment:\n*   n(N₂) = 0.10 mol  =>  `2n` = 0.10  =>  `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   n(O₂) = 0.025 mol =>  `n/2` = 0.025 =>  `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   n(H₂O) = 0.20 mol  =>  `4n` = 0.20  =>  `n` = 0.05 mol\n\nAll calculations consistently yield `n` = 0.05 mol. This strongly supports our hypothesis. Let's verify the initial mass.\n*   M(NH₄NO₃) = 80 g/mol;  M(NH₄NO₂) = 64 g/mol\n*   m(total) = n*M(NH₄NO₃) + n*M(NH₄NO₂)\n*   m(total) = (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given total mass. The salts are indeed NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nNow we find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate): NH₄NO₃**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite): NH₄NO₂**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in salts A and B:**\n    *   Total atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses using integers for simplicity as per problem values\nM_H2O = 18\nM_O2 = 32\nM_N2 = 28\nM_NH4NO3 = 80\nM_NH4NO2 = 64\nVm_STP = 22.4\n\n# Given data\nmass_H2O = 3.60\nmass_O2 = 0.80\nvol_C = 2.24\ninitial_mass = 7.20\n\n# Calculate moles of products\nn_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O  # 0.2 mol\nn_O2 = mass_O2 / M_O2    # 0.025 mol\nn_N2 = vol_C / Vm_STP      # 0.1 mol\n\n# From stoichiometry, n_O2 = n_NH4NO3 / 2\n# So, moles of NH4NO3 = 2 * n_O2\nn = 2 * n_O2 # This gives n=0.05, the moles for each salt.\n\n# Verification of mass\ncalculated_mass = n * M_NH4NO3 + n * M_NH4NO2\n\n# Final atom calculation\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 3  # For NH4NO3\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 2  # For NH4NO2\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Moles of each salt (n): {n}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass: {calculated_mass} g (Matches given mass {initial_mass} g)\")\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in salts A and B: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",

We can identify the products by the function of each tube and the change in its mass.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases such as CO₂ or SO₂. The mass of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced. This tells us the original salts A and B do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas (O₂) according to the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in mass of the tube is due to the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** The gas that did not react in any of the tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP). Since H₂O and O₂ were removed, and no acidic gases were present, this remaining gas is likely nitrogen (N₂), a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n    *   Volume of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol\n\nSo, the decomposition products are 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂. The salts must therefore be composed of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe are looking for two salts containing H, N, and O that decompose upon heating. Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) are excellent candidates. Let's examine their decomposition reactions.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate:** The decomposition of ammonium nitrate can vary with temperature. Since the products include N₂ and O₂, the relevant reaction is: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). For stoichiometric calculations, we can simplify this to a per-mole basis: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂(g) + ½O₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture of A and B was **equimolar**. Let `n` be the number of moles of salt A and `n` be the number of moles of salt B. Let's assume A is NH₄NO₃ and B is NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃: produces `n` mol N₂, `0.5n` mol O₂, and `2n` mol H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: produces `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n\nThe total moles of products would be:\n*   Total moles of N₂ = `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n`\n*   Total moles of O₂ = `0.5n` (from A) + 0 (from B) = `0.5n`\n*   Total moles of H₂O = `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n`\n\nNow we equate these expressions with the moles calculated in Step 1:\n*   `2n` = 0.10 mol (N₂)  => `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   `0.5n` = 0.025 mol (O₂) => `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   `4n` = 0.20 mol (H₂O)   => `n` = 0.05 mol\n\nAll calculations give a consistent value of `n` = 0.05 mol. This confirms our hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Initial Mass**\nLet's check if 0.05 mol of each salt adds up to the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64 g/mol\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of each.\n*   **Total Atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThe following Python code verifies the calculations.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nM_H2O = 18.0  # g/mol\nM_O2 = 32.0   # g/mol\nVm_STP = 22.4 # L/mol\n\n# Experimental data\nmass_H2O_produced = 3.60\nmass_O2_produced = 0.80\nvol_N2_produced = 2.24\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate moles of products ---\nn_H2O = mass_H2O_produced / M_H2O\nn_O2 = mass_O2_produced / M_O2\nn_N2 = vol_N2_produced / Vm_STP\n\n# --- Step 2: Solve for moles of salts ---\n# From stoichiometry: n_O2 = 0.5 * n_salt_A and n_N2 = n_salt_A + n_salt_B\n# Since the mixture is equimolar, n_salt_A = n_salt_B = n\n# 0.5 * n = n_O2  => n = 2 * n_O2\nn = 2 * n_O2\n\n# --- Step 3: Verify with initial mass ---\nM_NH4NO3 = 80.0 # g/mol\nM_NH4NO2 = 64.0 # g/mol\ntotal_mass_calculated = n * M_NH4NO3 + n * M_NH4NO2\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate total atoms ---\n# Salt A: NH4NO3 -> 2 N, 4 H, 3 O\natoms_in_A = 2 + 4 + 3\n# Salt B: NH4NO2 -> 2 N, 4 H, 2 O\natoms_in_B = 2 + 4 + 2\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\n\nprint(f\"Calculated moles of each salt (n): {n:.2f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass: {total_mass_calculated:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in salts A and B: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>",

As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe mixture of gases formed from the decomposition of salts A and B is passed through a series of tubes. We can identify the products by the function of each tube and the change in its mass.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases such as CO₂ or SO₂. The mass of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced. This tells us the original salts A and B do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas (O₂) according to the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in mass of the tube is due to the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** The gas that did not react in any of the tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP). Since H₂O and O₂ were removed, and no acidic gases were present, this remaining gas is likely nitrogen (N₂), a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n    *   Volume of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol\n\nSo, the decomposition products are 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂. The salts must therefore be composed of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe are looking for two salts containing H, N, and O that decompose upon heating. Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) are excellent candidates. Let's examine their decomposition reactions.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate:** The decomposition of ammonium nitrate can vary with temperature. Since the products include N₂ and O₂, the relevant reaction is: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). For stoichiometric calculations, we can simplify this to a per-mole basis: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂(g) + ½O₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture of A and B was **equimolar**. Let `n` be the number of moles of salt A and `n` be the number of moles of salt B. Let's assume A is NH₄NO₃ and B is NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃: produces `n` mol N₂, `0.5n` mol O₂, and `2n` mol H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: produces `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n\nThe total moles of products would be:\n*   Total moles of N₂ = `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n`\n*   Total moles of O₂ = `0.5n` (from A) + 0 (from B) = `0.5n`\n*   Total moles of H₂O = `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n`\n\nNow we equate these expressions with the moles calculated in Step 1:\n*   `2n` = 0.10 mol (N₂)  => `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   `0.5n` = 0.025 mol (O₂) => `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   `4n` = 0.20 mol (H₂O)   => `n` = 0.05 mol\n\nAll calculations give a consistent value of `n` = 0.05 mol. This confirms our hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Initial Mass**\nLet's check if 0.05 mol of each salt adds up to the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64 g/mol\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of each.\n*   **Total Atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThe following Python code verifies the calculations.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nM_H2O = 18.0  # g/mol\nM_O2 = 32.0   # g/mol\nVm_STP = 22.4 # L/mol\n\n# Experimental data\nmass_H2O_produced = 3.60\nmass_O2_produced = 0.80\nvol_N2_produced = 2.24\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate moles of products ---\nn_H2O = mass_H2O_produced / M_H2O\nn_O2 = mass_O2_produced / M_O2\nn_N2 = vol_N2_produced / Vm_STP\n\n# --- Step 2: Solve for moles of salts ---\n# From stoichiometry: n_O2 = 0.5 * n_salt_A and n_N2 = n_salt_A + n_salt_B\n# Since the mixture is equimolar, n_salt_A = n_salt_B = n\n# 0.5 * n = n_O2  => n = 2 * n_O2\nn = 2 * n_O2\n\n# --- Step 3: Verify with initial mass ---\nM_NH4NO3 = 80.0 # g/mol\nM_NH4NO2 = 64.0 # g/mol\ntotal_mass_calculated = n * M_NH4NO3 + n * M_NH4NO2\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate total atoms ---\n# Salt A: NH4NO3 -> 2 N, 4 H, 3 O\natoms_in_A = 2 + 4 + 3\n# Salt B: NH4NO2 -> 2 N, 4 H, 2 O\natoms_in_B = 2 + 4 + 2\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\n\nprint(f\"Calculated moles of each salt (n): {n:.2f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass: {total_mass_calculated:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in salts A and B: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>",

Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol O₂**.\n    *   Gas C (Remaining gas): Unreactive gas. Volume = 2.24 L at STP. Moles = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.
