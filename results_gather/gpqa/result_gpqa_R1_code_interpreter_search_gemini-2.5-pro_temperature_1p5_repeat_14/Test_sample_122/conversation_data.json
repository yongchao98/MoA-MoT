    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is considered the \"stationary\" frame of reference. We want to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. The time elapsed in this frame (50 seconds) is the proper time (Δt₀).\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at v = 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper time (Δt₀):** The time that passes in the ejecta's frame is Δt₀ = 50 s.\n*   **Speed of light (c):** The speed of light is approximately c = 300,000 km/s.\n\n**3. Apply the Principle of Time Dilation**\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time passes more slowly for a moving object when observed from a stationary frame of reference. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nΔt = γ * Δt₀\n\nwhere:\n*   **Δt** is the time elapsed in the stationary frame (the Galaxy's frame).\n*   **Δt₀** is the proper time, the time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame).\n*   **γ (gamma)** is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor depends on the relative velocity (v) and the speed of light (c). It is calculated as:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n*   v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\nNow, plug this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.2)²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04)\n*   γ = 1 / √(0.96)\n\n**5. Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\nNow we can calculate how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame of reference:\n*   Δt = γ * Δt₀\n*   Δt = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s\n\n**6. Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**\nFinally, the distance (d) traveled by the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's frame is the ejecta's velocity (in that frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (in that frame):\n*   d = v * Δt\n*   d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )\n*   d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km\n*   d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a calculator or the provided Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndelta_t0 = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate the ratio v/c\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (delta_t)\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n> executing code...\n3061862.1784789723\n> execution finished\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. This is closest to option D.\n\nLet's re-examine the options:\nA) 2,880,000 km\nB) 3,000,000 km (This would be the non-relativistic answer: 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\nC) 2,940,000 km\nD) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of ~3,061,862 km is extremely close to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically involving time dilation.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the physics and calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The \"stationary\" frame is the Galaxy's frame of reference.\n    *   The \"moving\" frame is the supernova ejecta's frame of reference.\n\n2.  **Identify the given quantities:**\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\".\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`. In this case, `distance = v × Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the *Galaxy's* frame.\n\n4.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    *   According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly in the moving frame (the ejecta). This effect is called time dilation. The relationship is given by the formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   `Δt` is the time measured in the stationary (Galaxy) frame.\n    *   `Δt₀` is the proper time, measured in the moving (ejecta) frame.\n    *   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Calculation Steps:**\n    *   **First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n        *   Calculate the ratio `v/c`: `60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`.\n        *   Square this ratio: `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`.\n        *   Calculate `1 - (v/c)²`: `1 - 0.04 = 0.96`.\n        *   Take the square root: `√(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`.\n        *   Calculate γ: `γ = 1 / √(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`.\n\n    *   **Second, calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n        *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`.\n\n    *   **Third, calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame:**\n        *   `distance = v * Δt`\n        *   `distance = 60,000 km/s * (γ * 50 s)`\n        *   `distance = 60,000 * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 )`\n        *   `distance = 3,000,000 / √(0.96)`\n\nThe Python code you ran performed this exact calculation:\n`distance = 3000000 / math.sqrt(0.96)` which resulted in `3061862.178... km`.\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the options:**\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km (This is the incorrect, non-relativistic answer: `60,000 km/s * 50 s`)\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of **3,061,862 km** is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
