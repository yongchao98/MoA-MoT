    "The user is describing an experiment that simulates a gut infection and observes the resulting immune response in a specific location. Let's break down the key pieces of information:\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery:** Rotavirus proteins are delivered orally. Rotavirus is a gut pathogen, so this mimics a natural infection route.\n2.  **Immune Response Location:** The response is observed in Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a key component of the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) and are secondary lymphoid organs where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated.\n3.  **Cell Population:** The cells being analyzed are \"proliferating,\" which indicates an active immune response is underway (clonal expansion).\n4.  **Genetic Finding:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" shows \"high variability.\" The variable region of an antibody is what binds to the antigen.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options based on this context:\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system's response to pathogens, involving a cascade of serum proteins. It does not involve genetic changes in B cells' immunoglobulin genes.\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors (antibodies). It occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) during the initial development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The experiment is looking at cells that are already responding to an antigen in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n*   **C) Class switching recombination:** This process occurs in activated B cells within secondary lymphoid organs. It changes the constant region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which alters the antibody's function, but it does *not* alter the variable region or increase its variability.\n*   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that occurs in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This process, followed by selection of B cells with the highest antigen affinity, is called affinity maturation. The introduction of numerous point mutations is precisely what would lead to the observed \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating B cell population.\n\nTherefore, the process responsible for the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in Peyer's patches after antigen exposure is somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
