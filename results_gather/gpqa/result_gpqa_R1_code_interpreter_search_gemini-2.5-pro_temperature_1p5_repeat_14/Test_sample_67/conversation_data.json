    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:**\n    *   The particle is spin 1/2 with magnetic moment `μ = γS`.\n    *   Initially, there's a magnetic field `B` in the `+z` direction. The particle is \"aligned\" with this field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n    *   The initial Hamiltonian is `H_0 = -μ · B = -γ(S_x B_x + S_y B_y + S_z B_z) = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The eigenstates of `H_0` are the eigenstates of `S_z`, which are spin-up `|↑z>` and spin-down `|↓z>`.\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_↑ = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_↓ = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   The lowest energy state is `E_↑`, corresponding to the spin-up state `|↑z>`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |↑z>`.\n\n2.  **Identify the new Hamiltonian and the dynamics for t > 0:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+y` direction, `B' = B * y_hat`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t>0` is `H = -μ · B' = -γB S_y`.\n    *   The state of the system will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation governed by this new Hamiltonian `H`.\n    *   The state at a later time `t` is given by `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting `H`, we get `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ)|↑z> = exp(iγBt S_y/ħ)|↑z>`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment:**\n    *   We want to find the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`, which is `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is equivalent to `γ<S_z(t)> = γ<ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`. We need to find the oscillation frequency of this quantity.\n    *   There are a few ways to calculate this. A physically intuitive way is to use the concept of Larmor precession. In the Heisenberg picture, the equation of motion for the spin operator `S` is `dS/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S]`. For `H = -γB S_y`, this leads to `dS/dt = γ(S x B')`. This equation describes the precession of the spin vector `S` around the new magnetic field `B'` (which is along the y-axis) with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n4.  **Visualize the precession:**\n    *   Initially, the spin is pointing along the `+z` direction (`S(0)` is aligned with `z_hat`).\n    *   The magnetic field is now along the `+y` direction.\n    *   The spin vector `S` will precess around the y-axis in the x-z plane.\n    *   The z-component of the spin vector at time `t`, `S_z(t)`, will be the projection of the precessing vector onto the z-axis.\n    *   If the vector `S(0)` of magnitude `S` is initially on the z-axis and precesses around the y-axis with angular frequency `ω`, its projection on the z-axis at time `t` is `S_z(t) = S * cos(ωt)`.\n    *   Therefore, the expectation value `<S_z(t)>` will oscillate as `<S_z(0)> * cos(ωt)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the oscillation frequency:**\n    *   The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`.\n    *   So, the expectation value `<S_z(t)>` oscillates as `cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The full expression is `<S_z(t)> = <↑z|S_z|↑z> * cos(γBt) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The oscillation is described by the term `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is `γB`. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
