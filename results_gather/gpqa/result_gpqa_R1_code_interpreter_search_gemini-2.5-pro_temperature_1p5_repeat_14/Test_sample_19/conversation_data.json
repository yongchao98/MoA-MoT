    "This question asks to identify the core assumptions that constitute the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and then evaluate each of the four statements.\n\nThe central idea of the impulse approximation is that a high-energy interaction with a nucleus happens so quickly that it can be treated as an interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon. The other nucleons in the nucleus are considered \"spectators.\"\n\nLet's analyze each statement in this context:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is the fundamental starting point of the impulse approximation. We assume the probe (e.g., an electron or a neutrino) interacts with a single nucleon, rather than with a correlated pair of nucleons or with the meson fields that bind the nucleus. This is often called the \"one-body current\" assumption. If the interaction involved multiple nucleons simultaneously (two-body currents), the picture of a single \"struck\" nucleon would be invalid. Therefore, this assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This statement addresses what happens before and after the primary interaction. It implies that the incoming probe particle doesn't scatter from other nucleons before hitting the target nucleon (no initial state interactions), and the outgoing struck nucleon doesn't re-scatter on its way out of the nucleus (no final state interactions). While the full impulse approximation framework can be extended to include these effects (as in the Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation), the simplest and most basic form of the approximation—often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA)—relies on this assumption of transparency. It is crucial for treating the nucleon as if it were truly isolated during the event.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This is an assumption about the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself, not about the nucleon's interaction within the nucleus. The impulse approximation can be used in both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks. For example, in deep inelastic scattering, the impulse approximation is used to describe the interaction with a single nucleon, which is in turn described by its quark-parton constituents in a fully relativistic way. The nature of the quarks (relativistic or not) is a separate modeling choice from the approximation of treating the nucleon as free from its nuclear environment during the interaction. Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation itself.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the \"impulse\" part of the name. The approximation assumes the interaction time is extremely short compared to the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nuclear potential well. Because the interaction is so fast (an \"impulse\"), the nucleon doesn't have time to interact with the other nucleons via the nuclear force. It is, for the brief moment of the interaction, effectively \"free\" from its binding potential. This is a core concept of the approximation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are:\n*   The interaction targets a single nucleon (Statement 1).\n*   The rest of the nucleus is \"invisible\" to the incoming and outgoing particles (Statement 2).\n*   The targeted nucleon does not feel its binding potential during the brief interaction (Statement 4).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
