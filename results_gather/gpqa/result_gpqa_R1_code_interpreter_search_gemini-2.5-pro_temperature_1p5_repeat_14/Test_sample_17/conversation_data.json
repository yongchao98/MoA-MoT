    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Abundance Notation:**\n    The notation `[A/B]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element A to element B in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun. The formula is:\n    `[A/B] = log10(n_A/n_B)_star - log10(n_A/n_B)_sun`\n    where `n_A` and `n_B` are the number densities of elements A and B.\n\n2.  **Determine the Silicon Abundance in Star 1:**\n    We need to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `[Si/H]_1`, for Star 1. We are given `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` and `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`.\n    The abundances can be combined using the properties of logarithms:\n    `[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n    Substituting the given values:\n    `[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\n    From the definition of `[Si/H]_1`:\n    `log10(n_Si/n_H)_1 - log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun = 0.3`\n    So, the silicon abundance in Star 1 is:\n    `log10(n_Si/n_H)_1 = 0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun`\n\n3.  **Determine the Silicon Abundance in Star 2:**\n    Similarly, we need to find `[Si/H]_2` for Star 2. We are given `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` and `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`.\n    We can write `[Si/H]_2` as:\n    `[Si/H]_2 = [Si/Mg]_2 + [Mg/H]_2`\n\n    We need to find `[Si/Mg]_2`. The relationship between `[Si/Mg]` and `[Mg/Si]` is:\n    `[Si/Mg] = log10(n_Si/n_Mg)_star - log10(n_Si/n_Mg)_sun`\n    `[Si/Mg] = - (log10(n_Mg/n_Si)_star - log10(n_Mg/n_Si)_sun) = -[Mg/Si]`\n    Therefore, `[Si/Mg]_2 = -[Mg/Si]_2 = -0.3`.\n\n    Now, we can calculate `[Si/H]_2`:\n    `[Si/H]_2 = -0.3 + 0 = -0.3`\n\n    From the definition of `[Si/H]_2`:\n    `log10(n_Si/n_H)_2 - log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun = -0.3`\n    So, the silicon abundance in Star 2 is:\n    `log10(n_Si/n_H)_2 = -0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Atoms:**\n    The \"ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres\" refers to the ratio of their number densities, or more fundamentally, their abundance relative to hydrogen, `(n_Si/n_H)`. We need to calculate:\n    `Ratio = (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2`\n\n    To find this ratio, we can take the logarithm:\n    `log10(Ratio) = log10((n_Si/n_H)_1) - log10((n_Si/n_H)_2)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions we found in steps 2 and 3:\n    `log10(Ratio) = (0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun) - (-0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun)`\n    `log10(Ratio) = 0.3 - (-0.3)`\n    `log10(Ratio) = 0.6`\n\n    Now, solve for the ratio:\n    `Ratio = 10^0.6`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    The final step is to calculate the numerical value of 10^0.6.\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Calculate the ratio 10^0.6\n    ratio = 10**0.6\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    \n    The computed value is approximately 3.98. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~1.2\n    B) ~0.8\n    C) ~3.9\n    D) ~12.6\n    The calculated ratio of ~3.98 is closest to 3.9.\n\n    Note: The stellar masses and the specific solar abundances of Fe and Mg were extraneous information, as they were not needed for the final calculation of the ratio.\n\n<<<C>>>"
