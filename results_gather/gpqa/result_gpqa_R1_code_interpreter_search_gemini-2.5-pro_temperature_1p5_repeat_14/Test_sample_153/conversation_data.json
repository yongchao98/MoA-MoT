    "*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158, with an abundance of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32 or ~3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the options using the ³⁵Cl isotope. The molecular formula for all options is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   MW = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   All four options are isomers and are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak stretching from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is observed. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding in the carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. A carbonyl in a conjugated carboxylic acid appears in the 1725-1700 cm⁻¹ range.\n    *   These two peaks together are a strong indication that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Evaluating the options:\n        *   A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: Contains a carboxylic acid group. Consistent.\n        *   B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Contains a carboxylic acid group. Consistent.\n        *   C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Has an aldehyde (C=O) and a phenol (O-H). The O-H stretch of a phenol is broad, but typically not as broad as a carboxylic acid (usually 3500-3200 cm⁻¹). The IR is less consistent with this option.\n        *   D) Phenyl chloroformate: This is an acid chloride/ester. It lacks an O-H group, so it would not have the broad peak at 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. The carbonyl peak for an acid chloride is also at a higher frequency (around 1800 cm⁻¹). This option is inconsistent with the IR data.\n    *   The IR data strongly suggests the compound is either 4-chlorobenzoic acid or 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal appearing at such a high chemical shift (δ > 10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet as it doesn't couple with other protons and integrates to one proton. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** We have two signals in the aromatic region:\n        *   8.02 ppm (d, 2H)\n        *   7.72 ppm (d, 2H)\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two substituents are electronically different, leading to two distinct chemical environments for the aromatic protons.\n        *   The protons labeled Ha are ortho (adjacent) to the strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, making them more deshielded and shifting them further downfield (8.02 ppm). They are split into a doublet by the adjacent Hb protons.\n        *   The protons labeled Hb are ortho to the chlorine atom, which is less electron-withdrawing than the carboxylic acid group. They are therefore more shielded (further upfield at 7.72 ppm) compared to Ha. They are split into a doublet by the adjacent Ha protons.\n    *   Let's check the remaining options against this NMR pattern:\n        *   A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) molecule. It would produce exactly the observed pattern of two doublets, each for 2H. This is a perfect match.\n        *   B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) molecule. It would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets). This is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   All three pieces of spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) are fully consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
