    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a classic Michael Addition reaction. It involves the addition of a nucleophile (an enolate in this case) to the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):** The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate. We must identify the available α-protons.\n    *   The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The carbonyl group is at C1.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C2 has one ethyl group and one methyl group attached. It has **no** α-hydrogens.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C6 has one methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can **only** occur at the C6 position. The bulky t-BuOK base will abstract the single available α-proton at C6 to form a specific enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:** The C6 of the enolate anion acts as the nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the CH₂ group of the ethyl acrylate. Subsequent protonation (during workup) yields the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:** The resulting molecule has the ethyl propanoate moiety attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   The core structure is: `6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one`.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:** The options provide IUPAC names where the ethyl propanoate is the parent chain. We must name the cyclohexanone part as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   Parent chain: ethyl propanoate (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`). The substituent is at C3.\n    *   Substituent: A substituted cyclohexyl ring. According to IUPAC rules for naming complex substituents, the carbon atom attached to the main chain is numbered as C1.\n    *   Let's number the substituent ring:\n        *   C1 is the attachment point (the original C6 of the ketone). This carbon has a methyl group.\n        *   To give the principal functional group (the ketone's C=O) the lowest possible number, we number towards it. The carbonyl carbon (original C1 of the ketone) becomes C2.\n        *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (original C2 of the ketone) becomes C3.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Combining everything, the full name for product A is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n    This matches the name for A given in options B and C.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → B\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael Addition.\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane. The α-carbon is the one bonded to the electron-withdrawing nitro group (-NO₂). The resulting carbanion (a nitronate) is resonance-stabilized and is a good nucleophile.\n    *   `CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂ + OH⁻  ⇌  [CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻ + H₂O`\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the deprotonated 1-nitropropane attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed. The intermediate is then protonated by water.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   Structure: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃) - CH₂-CN`\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:** We need to find the IUPAC name.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN). The main chain must include the nitrile carbon.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. Thus, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        `C6H₃-C5H₂-C4H(NO₂)-C3H(CH₃)-C2H₂-C1N`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is: **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n    This matches the name for B given in options B and D.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing this with the given options, only option B has both correct products.\n\n**A)** Incorrect A, Incorrect B\n**B)** Correct A, Correct B\n**C)** Correct A, Incorrect B\n**D)** Incorrect A, Correct B\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
