    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds:\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The presence of two distinct signals implies we are seeing signals from both compounds in the mixture.\n    *   For the ratio to be 1:1 in a 1:1 mixture, each signal must arise from the same number of protons.\n    *   Since there are only two signals in total for the mixture, it is most likely that each compound contributes exactly one singlet in this region. Therefore, we are looking for two compounds that each have only one type of aromatic proton.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   These signals must come from the methyl (CH3) or ethyl (CH2CH3) groups. The fact that they are all singlets is a crucial clue, suggesting the protons on the alkyl groups are not coupled to any other non-equivalent protons. This is characteristic of methyl groups attached to the aromatic ring. Ethyl groups would show a quartet and a triplet.\n\n**2. Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each option:**\n\nLet's predict the number of signals for each compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 12H).\n    *   *Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet, 1 aliphatic singlet.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent, but because they are chemically equivalent, they will appear as **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but are in a different chemical environment from the first pair. This results in **two singlets** (each integrating to 6H).\n    *   *Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet, 2 aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyl groups) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl group and the C5-methyl group) are in different environments. This will produce **two singlets** (each integrating to 1H).\n    *   *This compound alone would produce two aromatic signals. Therefore, it cannot be part of a mixture that has only two aromatic signals in total (one from each component).* This eliminates any option containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Options A, C, and D).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Ethyl Protons:** The problem states the aliphatic signals are *singlets*. An ethyl group produces a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3). Therefore, this compound cannot be in the mixture. This also eliminates option D.\n\n**3. Verify the correct combination:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the only possible combination is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's confirm that a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the given data.\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB (1:1 molar ratio).\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (from 2H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one singlet (from 2H).\n    *   Total: Two singlets. Since they both originate from 2 protons and the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the integration ratio will be 1:1. **This matches the data.**\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (from 12H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (each from 6H).\n    *   Total: Three singlets.\n    *   The integration ratio of these three signals will be 12H : 6H : 6H. Dividing by the smallest number (6) gives a simplified ratio of **2:1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that perfectly accounts for all the features of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
