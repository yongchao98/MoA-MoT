    "This question involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH₂), in liquid ammonia. This reaction proceeds through a benzyne intermediate via an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\nThe starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This means we have a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. There is also a hydrogen atom (H) at position 6. Both positions 2 and 6 are *ortho* to the bromine atom.\n\n```\n      Br (at C1)\n     / \\\n  (D)C--C(H) (at C6)\n   ||  ||\n   ...\n```\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination)**\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), will abstract an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (Br⁻). There are two possibilities:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6:** The amide ion removes the proton from the C-6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 to form a benzyne intermediate. The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect), so this pathway is favored and will be the major pathway.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is a benzyne with the triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom remains at C-2. Let's call this **Benzyne A**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2:** The amide ion removes the deuteron from the C-2 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C-1. This pathway is disfavored due to the stronger C-D bond but is still possible.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is a benzyne with the triple bond between C-1 and C-2. This benzyne does not contain a deuterium atom, as it was removed in this step. Let's call this **Benzyne B**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\nThe nucleophile, which is another amide ion (NH₂⁻), will attack one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃) to give the final product(s).\n\n*   **Products from Benzyne A (triple bond C1-C6, D at C2):**\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂⁻ group attacks C-1. A negative charge develops on C-6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The product has the NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The NH₂⁻ group attacks C-6. A negative charge develops on C-1, which is protonated. If we number the final product with the NH₂ group at the #1 position, the original C-6 is now C-1, and the original C-2 (where the deuterium is) is now C-3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Benzyne B (triple bond C1-C2, no D):**\n    1.  **Attack at C-1 or C-2:** The NH₂⁻ group can attack either C-1 or C-2 of the benzyne triple bond. Since this benzyne is symmetrical (ignoring the other ring protons) and contains no deuterium, attack at either position, followed by protonation, will lead to the same product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\n**Step 4: Count the Distinct Organic Products**\nBased on the two possible benzyne intermediates, we have identified three different possible organic products:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nThese three molecules are distinct chemical compounds (isotopomers/regioisomers). Therefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
