    "*   **Step 1: Understand the equilibrium.**\n    The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The formation reaction is:\n    Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻\n    The equilibrium constant for this formation is the formation constant, K_f (also given as K_Ca-EDTA).\n    K_f = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    We are starting with the complex and want to find the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions that result from its dissociation. Therefore, we should consider the reverse reaction, which is the dissociation of the complex:\n    Ca-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the dissociation constant (K_d).**\n    The dissociation constant, K_d, is the inverse of the formation constant, K_f.\n    K_d = 1 / K_f\n    K_d = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    K_d = 0.2 x 10⁻¹⁰ = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n*   **Step 3: Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    Let's represent the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca-EDTA²⁻ that dissociates.\n\n| Species         | Ca-EDTA²⁻       | Ca²⁺      | EDTA⁴⁻    |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M          | 0 M       | 0 M       |\n| **Change (C)**  | -x              | +x        | +x        |\n| **Equilibrium (E)**| 0.02 - x        | x         | x         |\n\n*   **Step 4: Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation.**\n    K_d = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA²⁻]\n    Substituting the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n*   **Step 5: Solve for x.**\n    Since K_d is extremely small (2 x 10⁻¹¹), the amount of complex that dissociates, 'x', will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n    Now, solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x² ≈ 40 x 10⁻¹⁴\n\n    Take the square root of both sides to find x:\n    x ≈ √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    x ≈ √40 * 10⁻⁷\n    Since √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, √40 is approximately 6.3.\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n*   **Step 6: Final Concentration.**\n    From the ICE table, the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n    [Ca²⁺] = 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n*   **Step 7: Compare with options.**\n    The calculated value matches option D.\n\nWe can also use a python script for a more precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Formation constant\nKf = 5e10\n# Initial concentration of the complex\nC_complex = 0.02\n\n# The dissociation constant Kd is 1/Kf\nKd = 1 / Kf\n\n# We need to solve the quadratic equation x^2 + Kd*x - Kd*C_complex = 0\n# The equation is derived from Kd = x^2 / (C_complex - x)\n# a=1, b=Kd, c=-Kd*C_complex\na = 1\nb = Kd\nc = -Kd * C_complex\n\n# Using the quadratic formula: x = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n# We use the positive root because concentration cannot be negative.\nx = (-b + math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\nExecution output:\n6.32e-07\n\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of calcium ions is 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium reaction:\n\nCa-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the given formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA):\n\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nLet's set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to determine the concentration of Ca²⁺ at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the change in concentration.\n\n| Species         | Ca-EDTA²⁻       | Ca²⁺      | EDTA⁴⁻    |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M          | 0 M       | 0 M       |\n| **Change (C)**  | -x              | +x        | +x        |\n| **Equilibrium (E)**| 0.02 - x        | x         | x         |\n\nThe expression for the dissociation constant is:\n\nK_d = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA²⁻]\n\nSubstituting the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:\n\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nSince K_d is extremely small, the amount of the complex that dissociates, 'x', will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], at equilibrium is x.\n\n[Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThis matches option D. The Python code execution also confirms this result (6.32e-07).\n\n<<<D>>>"
