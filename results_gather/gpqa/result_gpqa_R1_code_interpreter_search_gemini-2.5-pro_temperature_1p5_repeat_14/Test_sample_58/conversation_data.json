    "This problem requires us to calculate the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The approach involves a series of neutralization reactions.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\n*   First, we determine the number of moles of the acidic and basic components before they are mixed.\n*   Moles = Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L)\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   HCl dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl-\n    *   Moles of H+ (from HCl) = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Ba(OH)2 dissociates completely: Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Perform neutralization reactions.**\n*   The guiding principle is that strong acids and strong bases react with each other first, completely. Any remaining strong species will then react with the weak species.\n\n*   **Step 2a: Reaction between Strong Acid (H+) and Strong Base (OH-)**\n    *   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n    *   Initial moles H+ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H+ from the strong acid is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Step 2b: Reaction between remaining Strong Base (OH-) and Weak Acid (CH3COOH)**\n    *   Now, the 0.100 mol of excess OH- will react with the weak acid, CH3COOH.\n    *   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n    *   The CH3COOH is the limiting reactant in this step. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Determine the final composition and calculate pH.**\n*   After all reactions, the solution contains:\n    *   0.050 mol of excess OH- (a strong base)\n    *   0.050 mol of CH3COO- (the conjugate base of acetic acid)\n    *   Various spectator ions (Cl-, Ba2+) which do not affect the pH.\n*   The pH of the final solution is primarily determined by the concentration of the excess strong base, OH-. The contribution from the hydrolysis of the weak conjugate base (CH3COO-) is negligible due to the common-ion effect from the large amount of OH- already present.\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n    *   Final [OH-] = (Moles of excess OH-) / (Total Volume)\n    *   Final [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nLet's confirm with a quick calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of reactants\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500\nmoles_h_strong = 0.2 * 0.400\nmoles_oh_strong = 2 * (0.3 * 0.300)\n\n# Neutralization steps\nmoles_oh_after_hcl = moles_oh_strong - moles_h_strong\nmoles_oh_final = moles_oh_after_hcl - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Final calculation\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\nfinal_oh_conc = moles_oh_final / total_volume\npOH = -math.log10(final_oh_conc)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The final pH of the solution is: {pH:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe final pH of the solution is: 12.62\n<<<C>>>",
