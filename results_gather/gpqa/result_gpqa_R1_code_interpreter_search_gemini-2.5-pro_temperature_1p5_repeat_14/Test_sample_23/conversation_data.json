    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CnHm is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   14.28% is approximately 1/7. So, `m / (12n + m) ≈ 1/7`, which gives `7m ≈ 12n + m`, leading to `6m ≈ 12n`, or `m = 2n`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   We are told Z does not react further with hydrogen and is formed from hydrogenation, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Both fit the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture X gives *only* Z. This implies that all components of X have the same number of carbon atoms as Z.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, W and Z.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means `Hydrogenation(W) -> Z` and `Hydrogenation(Z) -> Z`.\n    *   Since Z is a saturated cycloalkane, `Hydrogenation(Z) -> Z` is expected (no reaction).\n    *   For `Hydrogenation(W) -> Z`, where W does not decolorize bromine water, W must be either a saturated isomer of Z that can be isomerized to Z under \"severe\" hydrogenation conditions, or an aromatic compound that can be hydrogenated to Z.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Disproportionation\" Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X (equimolar A + B) reacts on a heated platinum catalyst to form mixture Y (equimolar W + Z). This is described as a disproportionation.\n    *   In organic chemistry, disproportionation on a metal catalyst often refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are hydrogenated and others are dehydrogenated.\n    *   Let's formulate the reaction: `A + B -> W + Z`. Since the mixtures are equimolar, we can assume a 1:1:1:1 molar ratio for the reaction components.\n\n4.  **Hypothesize the Identities of W and Z and Test.**\n    *   **Hypothesis 1:** W is a saturated isomer of Z. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), a very common solvent. W could be methylcyclopentane (C6H12), which is known to isomerize to cyclohexane under severe hydrogenation conditions.\n        *   In this case, Y = {methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane}. Both are C6H12.\n        *   The reaction would be: `A(C6Hx) + B(C6Hy) -> cyclohexane(C6H12) + methylcyclopentane(C6H12)`.\n        *   To balance the hydrogen atoms: `x + y = 12 + 12 = 24`.\n        *   However, A and B are components of mixture X, which decolorizes bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated. For a C6 cyclic hydrocarbon, the maximum number of hydrogens is 12 (for the saturated cycloalkane). Any unsaturation (double bond) reduces the hydrogen count. So, `x ≤ 10` and `y ≤ 10`. This means `x + y ≤ 20`.\n        *   The requirement `x + y = 24` contradicts `x + y ≤ 20`. Thus, Hypothesis 1 is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Hypothesis 2:** W is an aromatic compound. The only common C6 aromatic solvent is benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of benzene yields cyclohexane.\n        *   If W = benzene, then for `Hydrogenation(W) -> Z`, Z must be cyclohexane.\n        *   So, Y = {benzene (C6H6), cyclohexane (C6H12)}. Z is cyclohexane, and it is a constituent of Y. This is consistent.\n        *   Let's check the reaction again: `A + B -> W + Z`.\n        *   This becomes `A(C6Hx) + B(C6Hy) -> benzene(C6H6) + cyclohexane(C6H12)`.\n        *   To balance the hydrogen atoms: `x + y = 6 + 12 = 18`.\n        *   This result (`x + y = 18`) is consistent with A and B being unsaturated C6 hydrocarbons (where `x ≤ 10` and `y ≤ 10`).\n\n5.  **Identify Components of Mixture X.**\n    *   We need to find two different liquids, A and B, that satisfy the following conditions:\n        1.  They are C6 hydrocarbons.\n        2.  The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 18. The only way to achieve this with two different unsaturated C6 molecules is if one has 10 hydrogens (C6H10) and the other has 8 hydrogens (C6H8).\n        3.  They decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated).\n        4.  They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n        5.  Hydrogenation of both A and B gives cyclohexane (Z).\n\n    *   Let's find candidates:\n        *   For A = C6H10: **Cyclohexene** fits all criteria. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n        *   For B = C6H8: A cyclohexadiene is needed. To avoid conjugated bonds, we must choose **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated. 1,4-cyclohexadiene hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n\n    *   So, a candidate for mixture X is **{cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}**.\n\n6.  **Final Verification.**\n    *   **Mixture X**: Equimolar cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Correct.\n    *   **Reaction**: The disproportionation reaction `cyclohexene (C6H10) + 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) --[Pt/heat]--> cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6)` is a known type of cross-disproportionation and is balanced. It produces an equimolar mixture Y. Correct.\n    *   **Mixture Y**: {cyclohexane, benzene}. Neither decolorizes bromine water. Correct.\n    *   **Hydrocarbon Z**: Is cyclohexane. It is a constituent of Y. %H=14.28%. It's a solvent. Hydrogenation of X (cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene) and Y (benzene and cyclohexane) gives only cyclohexane. All conditions are met.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This is the number of hydrogens in one molecule of cyclohexene plus one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\nLet's confirm the hydrogen mass percentage in cyclohexane (C6H12).\n```python\n# Atomic mass of Carbon and Hydrogen\nC_mass = 12.011\nH_mass = 1.008\n\n# In C6H12\nH_total_mass = 12 * H_mass\nC_total_mass = 6 * C_mass\ntotal_mass = H_total_mass + C_total_mass\n\n# Mass fraction of Hydrogen\nH_fraction = H_total_mass / total_mass\nprint(f\"Hydrogen mass fraction in C6H12 is {H_fraction:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"1/7 is {1/7:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\nHydrogen mass fraction in C6H12 is 0.1437\n1/7 is 0.1429\nThe values are very close, confirming that C6H12 is the intended compound for Z. The small difference is due to using precise atomic weights versus approximate integer values (12 and 1), where the ratio is exactly 1/7.\n\nThe entire logical chain holds. The answer is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's a detailed step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Hydrocarbon Z**:\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n    *   Mass fraction of H = 14.28% = 0.1428. Mass fraction of C = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   The ratio of moles C : H is (85.72 / 12.01) : (14.28 / 1.008) ≈ 7.14 : 14.17.\n    *   Dividing by the smallest number (7.14), we get a ratio of approximately 1 : 2.\n    *   Therefore, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z, and Z does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also mentions that Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Both fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**:\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from mixture X upon treatment with heated platinum. This reaction is described as a disproportionation. In heterogeneous catalysis involving hydrocarbons, \"disproportionation\" often refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are dehydrogenated (lose hydrogen) and others are hydrogenated (gain hydrogen).\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Mixture Y consists of Z (our cycloalkane) and another liquid, let's call it W. So, Y = {W, Z}.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means `Hydrogenation(W) -> Z` and `Hydrogenation(Z) -> Z`. Since Z is already saturated, the second part is expected. For `Hydrogenation(W) -> Z` to occur, and given that W does not decolorize bromine water, W is most likely an aromatic compound that can be hydrogenated to the cycloalkane Z.\n    *   This strongly suggests that Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and W is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation under severe conditions yields cyclohexane. Both are liquids and widely used. This seems like a very strong hypothesis.\n    *   Let's check if all components have the same carbon skeleton. Hydrogenation of X, Y, W, and Z all lead to Z (cyclohexane). This confirms all compounds in this problem are based on a C6 skeleton.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Reaction**:\n    *   We have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, A and B. So X = {A, B}.\n    *   The reaction is: A + B --(Pt, heat)--> W + Z (in equimolar amounts).\n    *   Substituting our identified compounds: A(C6Hx) + B(C6Hy) -> Benzene(C6H6) + Cyclohexane(C6H12).\n    *   This is a hydrogen disproportionation. One molecule is fully dehydrogenated to benzene, and the other is fully hydrogenated to cyclohexane. To balance the number of hydrogen atoms, the total number of hydrogens in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in reactants = x + y.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 6 (from benzene) + 12 (from cyclohexane) = 18.\n    *   Therefore, **x + y = 18**.\n\n4.  **Identify Components of Mixture X (A and B)**:\n    *   We know A and B are two different C6 liquids.\n    *   They both decolorize bromine water, which means they are unsaturated (contain double bonds).\n    *   Their carbon skeleton is the same as cyclohexane. This implies they are cyclic C6 compounds.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B is 18.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Let's find plausible structures. We need two different unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbons that sum to 18 hydrogens.\n    *   A cycloalkane has formula CnH2n. A cycloalkene (one double bond) is CnH2n-2. A cycloalkadiene (two double bonds) is CnH2n-4.\n    *   For n=6:\n        *   Cyclohexane (saturated): C6H12\n        *   Cyclohexene (one double bond): C6H10\n        *   Cyclohexadiene (two double bonds): C6H8\n    *   We need two different molecules from this list (or isomers) whose hydrogens sum to 18. The combination `10 + 8 = 18` works perfectly.\n    *   So, one component (A) is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and the other (B) is a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" points to **1,4-cyclohexadiene** for the C6H8 molecule, as 1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds.\n    *   Let's check the final setup:\n        *   Mixture X = {cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}. Both are liquids, decolorize bromine water, and will hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n        *   Reaction: `Cyclohexene (C6H10) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)` --(Pt, heat)--> `Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`. This is a classic, balanced disproportionation reaction.\n        *   Mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}. Neither decolorizes bromine water.\n        *   Z = cyclohexane. It is part of Y. It's a solvent. Mass % H ≈ 14.3%. All conditions are perfectly met.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**:\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of substance A and one molecule of substance B.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
