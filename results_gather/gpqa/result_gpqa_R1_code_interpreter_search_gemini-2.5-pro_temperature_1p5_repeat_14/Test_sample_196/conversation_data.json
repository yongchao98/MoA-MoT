  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Identify the functional groups in Compound X from the IR data.**\n    *   The broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded.\n    *   The sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of C=C bonds in an aromatic ring.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: Compound X is likely an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the structure of Compound X from the ¹H NMR data.**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet far downfield is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a 1,4- (para) disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield signal (8.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal (7.2 ppm) corresponds to the protons adjacent to the other substituent, which must be electron-donating (an alkyl group).\n    *   **Aliphatic region (0.9 to 2.9 ppm):** We need to piece together the alkyl substituent from the remaining signals.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3H means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH₂ group.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3H means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH group.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H, likely a -CH₂ group coupled to several non-equivalent protons.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H, likely a -CH group coupled to several non-equivalent protons. This proton is the most deshielded in the alkyl chain, so it is likely the one attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:**\n        *   From the signals at 0.9 ppm and 1.4 ppm, we have the fragments -CH₂-CH₃ and -CH-CH₃.\n        *   Let's connect them via the remaining CH (2.9 ppm) and CH₂ (1.7 ppm) groups. The most logical structure is a sec-butyl group: CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-.\n        *   Let's check the splittings for a sec-butyl group attached to the ring:\n            *   CH attached to the ring (at 2.9 ppm): It is adjacent to a CH₂ group (2 protons) and a CH₃ group (3 protons). This would give a complex multiplet. (Matches)\n            *   CH₂ group (at 1.7 ppm): It is adjacent to the CH group (1 proton) and a CH₃ group (3 protons). This would give a complex multiplet. (Matches)\n            *   Terminal CH₃ on the ethyl part (at 0.9 ppm): It is adjacent to a CH₂ group (2 protons). It should be a triplet. (Matches)\n            *   Other CH₃ group (at 1.4 ppm): It is adjacent to the CH group (1 proton). It should be a doublet. (Matches)\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n    *   The reaction is with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   This combination (Red P / HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n    *   The reaction will not affect the alkyl group or the aromatic ring.\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Reaction: Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Product: The -COOH at position 1 is converted to a -CH₃ group. The sec-butyl group remains at position 4. The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Match the final product with the given options.**\n    *   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our deduced product.\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is incorrect.\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is an isomer of the starting material but with a different structure.\n\nThe correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
