    "An optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (or chiral center), which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. However, molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral if they possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such compounds are called meso compounds.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbons of the double bond are sp2 hybridized (bonded to only three groups). The other carbons do not have four different substituents.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the double bond).\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex bridged bicyclic compound. The name explicitly specifies the stereochemistry at two chiral centers (`3aR, 7aS`) and at a double bond (`E`).\n    *   When a specific enantiomer (like one with R and S designators) of a compound is named, and it's not a meso compound, it is by definition chiral.\n    *   Given the complexity and lack of symmetry in the structure, and the specification of a single stereoisomer, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3: -H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other chiral carbon group.\n    *   The specific stereoisomer is `(2R,3S)`. This `R,S` combination in a molecule with identical chiral centers leads to a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, which makes it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The `(2R,3R)` configuration is the diastereomer of the meso `(2R,3S)` form.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` isomer and its mirror image, the `(2S,3S)` isomer, are not superimposable on each other. They form a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   As a single enantiomer, `(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid` is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3-C4) and an alcohol group (at C1).\n    *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=CH- (path to the double bond one way), and -CH2-CH2-CH= (path to the double bond the other way).\n    *   Since C1 is a chiral center and there is only one in the molecule, the molecule must be chiral. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This compound has two possible stereoisomers: one where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis), and one where two are on one side and one is on the other (cis-trans).\n    *   The all-cis isomer is highly symmetric (point group C3v) and possesses three planes of symmetry. It is **achiral**.\n    *   The cis-trans isomer also possesses a plane of symmetry (point group Cs). It is also **achiral**.\n    *   Since both stereoisomers of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol are achiral, this compound is not optically active regardless of the specific isomer.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl ring)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We check for chiral centers.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is not chiral.\n        *   The -CH2- carbon is not chiral.\n        *   The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to a -H, two identical -CH3 groups, and the rest of the molecule. Since it has two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n        *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule. It also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\nSummary:\n*   Optically active (chiral):\n    *   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    *   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n*   Not optically active (achiral):\n    *   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    *   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
