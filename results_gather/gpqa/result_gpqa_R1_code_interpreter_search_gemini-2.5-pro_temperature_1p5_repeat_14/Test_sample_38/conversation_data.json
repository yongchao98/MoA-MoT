    "The problem requires us to find the value of the normalization constant 'a' for a given wave function Ψ(x).\n\n**1. Understand the Wave Function and Probability Density**\nThe wave function is given by:\nΨ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i\n\nThe probability of finding the particle at a position x is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|². This is also known as the probability density function, P(x).\nP(x) = |Ψ(x)|² = Ψ(x) * Ψ*(x)\n\nwhere Ψ*(x) is the complex conjugate of Ψ(x). To find the complex conjugate, we change the sign of the imaginary part:\nΨ*(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5*i\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability density P(x):\nP(x) = [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i ] * [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5*i ]\n\nUsing the algebraic identity (A - B)(A + B) = A² - B², we get:\nP(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² - (0.5*i)²\nP(x) = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * i²)\n\nSince i² = -1:\nP(x) = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * -1)\nP(x) = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**2. Apply the Normalization Condition**\nThe normalization condition states that the total probability of finding the particle in the region where it can exist must be equal to 1. The problem specifies that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, we must integrate the probability density function from 1 to 3 and set the result to 1.\n\n∫[from 1 to 3] P(x) dx = 1\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n**3. Solve the Integral**\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\nLet's solve each part. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x), and the integral of a constant is that constant times x.\n[ a² * ln(1 + x) ] from 1 to 3   +   [ 0.25 * x ] from 1 to 3   = 1\n\nNow, evaluate at the limits:\n[ a² * ln(1 + 3) - a² * ln(1 + 1) ] + [ 0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1 ] = 1\n[ a² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2) ] + [ 0.75 - 0.25 ] = 1\na² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\na² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\n**4. Solve for 'a'**\nNow, we isolate 'a':\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\nvalue_of_a = math.sqrt(0.5 / math.log(2))\nprint(value_of_a)\n```\n>0.8493266289945199\n\nThe calculated value of 'a' is approximately 0.8493.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.35\nB) 0.6\nC) 1.1\nD) 0.85\n\nThe value 0.8493 is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>",
