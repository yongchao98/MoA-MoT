    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: Melting Point of B**\n    *   The clue states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O, Deuterium Oxide) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clues 4 and 5: Precipitate G and Substance B**\n    *   Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of the thermal decomposition of a deuterated metal hydroxide, which would yield a metal oxide and heavy water.\n    *   `Metal(OD)x --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + D₂O (B)`\n    *   This means the precipitate **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clues 2 and 3: The Reaction of X and Y**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce a gas W and the precipitate G.\n    *   Since the products (G) contain deuterium, the reactants (X and/or Y) must also contain deuterium.\n    *   The clue states X incorporates a \"heavier isotope.\" This confirms X contains deuterium.\n    *   Let's analyze Gas W: \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n        *   Deuterium atom (D): 1 proton, 1 neutron.\n        *   Deuterium gas (D₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. This is a perfect candidate for W.\n    *   For D₂ gas to be produced, a deuteride (Substance X) must react with a deuterium source (Liquid Y). The most plausible candidate for a liquid deuterium source that would react violently with a reactive deuteride is heavy water itself.\n    *   So, we can deduce: **Liquid Y is D₂O**. The reaction is between Substance X (a deuteride) and D₂O.\n    *   Example reaction: `Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`\n\n4.  **Analyze Clues 7 and 8: Identifying Substance X**\n    *   Clue 8 states that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points towards common laboratory reagents rather than simple binary compounds. Strong reducing agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) are widely used. Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   Clue 7 states that the product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n        *   A keto acid contains a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   Strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄ (or its analog LiAlD₄) reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n        *   Ketone reduction: R-C(=O)-R' → R-CH(OH)-R' (1 oxygen).\n        *   Carboxylic acid reduction: R-COOH → R-CH₂OH (1 oxygen).\n        *   Therefore, the reduction of a keto acid by substance X produces a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups), which contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   This reaction chemistry is a perfect match for **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride**. Its non-deuterated analog is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   Thus, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Verify the Entire Reaction**\n    *   X = LiAlD₄\n    *   Y = D₂O\n    *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n    *   Gas W = D₂ (2 protons, 2 neutrons). Check.\n    *   Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). Check.\n    *   Heating G: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This produces B=D₂O. Check.\n    *   Melting point of B ≈ 277K. Check.\n    *   All clues are consistent with X = LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄). We will use integer mass numbers as the options are integers.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   **Lightest element** (by atomic number) is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   **Heaviest element** (by atomic number) is **Aluminium**.\n    *   The question states, \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   **Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Hydrogen, all as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium. The most common and stable isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum of the masses from the lightest and heaviest elements.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
