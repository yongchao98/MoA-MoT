    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the product of the given reaction:\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material (Reactant)**\n\n*   The reactant is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n*   The base structure, \"7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane,\" is cyclohexene oxide. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons, which are numbered C1 and C6.\n*   The substituents are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   The name provides the absolute stereochemistry at four chiral centers: C1 is R, C3 is R, C4 is R, and C6 is S. We don't need to draw the exact 3D structure; we can work directly from these stereochemical labels.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction Type**\n\n*   The reagent is **Me2CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate)**, which is a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n*   The problem provides two key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **SN2 mechanism**, which means there is an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Apply the Reaction Rules to the Specific Reactants**\n\n*   **Identify the site of attack:** The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom (implied, as it's not another named substituent).\n    *   Comparing a methyl group to a hydrogen atom, the hydrogen atom is much smaller. Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**. The Me⁻ nucleophile will attack C6.\n\n*   **Determine the consequences of the attack at C6:**\n    *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6, forming a new C-C bond.\n    *   The C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1.\n    *   After an aqueous workup (which is assumed to obtain the final neutral product), the oxygen atom becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanol, with the OH group at C1 and a new methyl group at C6.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   **Center of attack (C6):** The reaction causes an inversion of configuration at C6.\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is (S).\n    *   Inversion of (S) configuration gives (R) configuration.\n    *   So, the stereocenter at this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n\n*   **Other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4):** These centers are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps. Their configuration is retained.\n    *   C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   C3 remains **(R)**.\n    *   C4 remains **(R)**.\n\n**5. Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product**\n\n*   **Structure:** The product is a cyclohexane ring with the following substituents based on the original numbering:\n    *   At C1: an -OH group and a methyl group.\n    *   At C3: a methyl group.\n    *   At C4: a methyl group.\n    *   At C6: a new methyl group.\n\n*   **Numbering:** According to IUPAC rules for alcohols, the carbon bearing the -OH group is given the lowest possible number, which is C1.\n    *   Our product has the -OH group at the original C1 position, so the **New C1 = Old C1**.\n    *   Next, we number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The methyl groups are at positions corresponding to old C1, C3, C4, and C6.\n    *   Path 1 (numbering towards old C6): Substituents at New C1(Me), New C2(Me from old C6), New C4(Me from old C4), New C5(Me from old C3). Locants: **1, 2, 4, 5**.\n    *   Path 2 (numbering towards old C2): Substituents at New C1(Me), New C3(Me from old C3), New C4(Me from old C4), New C6(Me from old C6). Locants: 1, 3, 4, 6.\n    *   Comparing the locant sets (1,2,4,5) vs (1,3,4,6), the set (1,2,4,5) is lower.\n    *   So, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n*   **Assembling the full name:** We combine the locants with the stereochemistry.\n    *   **New C1** (from Old C1) is **R**.\n    *   **New C2** (from Old C6) is **R** (due to inversion S -> R).\n    *   **New C4** (from Old C4) is **R**.\n    *   **New C5** (from Old C3) is **R**.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect, shows S at C2)\n*   B) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect skeleton)\n*   C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect skeleton)\n*   D) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Matches our derived product)\n\n<<<D>>>"
