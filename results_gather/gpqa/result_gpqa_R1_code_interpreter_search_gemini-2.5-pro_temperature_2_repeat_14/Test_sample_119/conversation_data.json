    "*   **Understanding the Goal:** We want to find how the number of stars (`N`) per unit range of parallax (`plx`) changes with parallax. This can be written as the derivative `dN/d(plx)`. We need to determine the proportionality between `dN/d(plx)` and `plx`.\n\n*   **Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars (`n`), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant.\n\n*   **Step 1: Number of stars in a volume of space.**\n    Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space at a distance `d` from the observer, with a small thickness `dd`.\n    The surface area of a sphere with radius `d` is `A = 4 * π * d^2`.\n    The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = 4 * π * d^2 * dd`\n\n*   **Step 2: Relate number of stars to volume.**\n    Since the star density `n` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n    `dN = n * dV = n * (4 * π * d^2 * dd)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Introduce Parallax.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is defined as the inverse of the distance (`d`).\n    `plx = 1/d`  which means `d = 1/plx`\n\n*   **Step 4: Relate the intervals `dd` and `d(plx)`.**\n    We need to express the small change in distance `dd` in terms of a small change in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `d(d) / d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1/plx^2`\n    Rearranging this gives us:\n    `dd = -d(plx) / plx^2`\n    The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars within a given positive interval range, we only care about the magnitude:\n    `|dd| = d(plx) / plx^2`\n\n*   **Step 5: Substitute `d` and `dd` into the equation for `dN`.**\n    We start with our equation from Step 2:\n    `dN = n * 4 * π * d^2 * dd`\n    Now, substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = d(plx) / plx^2`:\n    `dN = n * 4 * π * (1/plx)^2 * (d(plx) / plx^2)`\n    `dN = n * 4 * π * (1/plx^2) * (d(plx) / plx^2)`\n    `dN = (n * 4 * π / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n*   **Step 6: Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    The quantity we are looking for is `dN / d(plx)`. We can find this by dividing both sides of the equation from Step 5 by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN / d(plx) = n * 4 * π / plx^4`\n\n*   **Step 7: Determine the proportionality.**\n    In the final expression, `n` (star density), `4`, and `π` are all constants. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4`\n\n*   **Conclusion:** This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
