    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the particles being collided with).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area that a target particle presents to an incoming particle for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Define λ1 and λ2 based on the formula:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. The incoming particle is a gas molecule, and the target particles are also gas molecules.\n        *   Let's call the collision cross-section for this interaction `σ_gas-gas`.\n        *   So, λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gas-gas).\n        *   (Note: The full formula for identical particles includes a √2 factor, λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas), to account for the relative motion of the target particles. However, for this comparison, the core relationship depends on the cross-section, so we can omit the constant factor without changing the conclusion.)\n\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of an electron from the beam colliding with gas molecules. The incoming particle is an electron, and the target particles are the gas molecules.\n        *   Let's call the collision cross-section for this interaction `σ_e-gas`.\n        *   So, λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conditions:**\n    *   The problem states that the conditions in the sample compartment (pressure, temperature, volume) are the same when measuring λ1 (before the beam is on) and λ2 (when the beam is on).\n    *   This means the number density `n` of the residual gas molecules is the same in both scenarios.\n    *   Therefore, the relationship between λ1 and λ2 depends solely on the inverse relationship of their respective collision cross-sections (`σ_gas-gas` and `σ_e-gas`).\n        *   If `σ_e-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`, then λ2 < λ1.\n        *   If `σ_e-gas` < `σ_gas-gas`, then λ2 > λ1.\n        *   If `σ_e-gas` = `σ_gas-gas`, then λ2 = λ1.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (`σ_gas-gas` vs. `σ_e-gas`):**\n    *   **`σ_gas-gas` (Kinetic Cross-Section):** This describes the collision between two neutral gas molecules. This interaction is short-range, primarily occurring when the molecules get physically close enough for their electron clouds to repel each other. It's often modeled as a \"billiard ball\" or \"hard-sphere\" collision, and the cross-section is related to the physical diameter of the molecules (σ ≈ πd²).\n\n    *   **`σ_e-gas` (Electron Scattering Cross-Section):** This describes the interaction between a high-energy, charged particle (the electron) and a neutral gas molecule. The interaction is governed by the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron does not need to physically \"hit\" the molecule in a billiard-ball sense. It can be deflected (elastic scattering) or transfer energy to excite or ionize the molecule (inelastic scattering) from a significant distance. Because of this long-range force, the effective target area a gas molecule presents to an electron is much larger than its physical size.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Due to the long-range electromagnetic interaction, the probability of an electron interacting with a gas molecule is much higher than the probability of two neutral gas molecules interacting over the same distance.\n    *   This means the electron-gas collision cross-section is significantly larger than the gas-gas collision cross-section: `σ_e-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`.\n    *   Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the cross-section (σ), a larger cross-section results in a shorter mean free path.\n    *   Therefore, λ2 < λ1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
