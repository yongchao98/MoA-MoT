    "This problem can be solved using the **method of images**. The electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere are equivalent to the field and potential of the original charge `q` plus an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere.\n\n### 1. Determining the Image Charge and its Position\n\nLet the center of the sphere be at the origin. The grounded conducting sphere has radius `R`, which means its surface potential is V = 0.\nThe real charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center (let's say on the z-axis, at z = d).\n\nFor the potential on the surface of the sphere to be zero, we need to place an image charge `q'` at a position `b` (also on the z-axis) inside the sphere. The values for `q'` and `b` that satisfy the V=0 boundary condition are:\n\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\nThese values ensure that for any point on the sphere's surface (at radius R), the potential from `q` and `q'` sum to zero.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the grounded sphere.\n\nA standard formula for the interaction energy `U` of a point charge `q` with a conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor.\n\nUsing the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\n1.  **Find the potential at position `d` due to the image charge `q'`:**\n    The image charge `q'` is at `b = R^2/d`.\n    The charge `q` is at `d`.\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `distance = d - b = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n\n    The potential `V_induced` at position `d` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n    `V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    By canceling out `d` from the numerator and the denominator, we get:\n    `V_induced = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n2.  **Calculate the net potential energy `U`:**\n    Now, we use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. The factor of 1/2 is present because the induced charge distribution is itself created by `q`, so the work is not simply `q * V_final` but an integral that results in the factor of 1/2.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) `U = - kq^2 d / (d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d / (d^2 + R^2)`\nC) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nD) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur derived potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
