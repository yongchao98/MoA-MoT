    "This problem asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field `f` within a sphere of radius R.\nThe vector field is given by `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\nThe volume of integration `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\nWe need to calculate: `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\n\nWe can use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem), which states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume `V`.\n\nMathematically: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, the volume `V` is the sphere of radius `R`, and the enclosing surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n\nThe vector field `f` has a singularity at the origin (`r = 0`), where its magnitude `1/r^2` becomes infinite. A direct calculation of the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` in spherical coordinates shows that `∇ ⋅ f = 0` for all `r ≠ 0`. However, the singularity at the origin contributes to the integral. The Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to calculate this integral by converting it to a surface integral on the boundary, which neatly handles the singularity inside.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral (flux) `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`:\n\n1.  **The vector field on the surface S**: The surface is a sphere of radius `r = R`. So, the vector field on this surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n\n2.  **The differential surface area element dS**: For a sphere, the differential area element `dS` is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the element and whose direction is perpendicular to the surface, pointing outward. In spherical coordinates, this is `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n\n3.  **The dot product f ⋅ dS**: Now we compute the dot product of the vector field and the surface element.\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n4.  **The surface integral**: We integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the spherical angles are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (∫_{φ=0}^{2π} dφ) * (∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ)`\n\n    Evaluate each integral:\n    *   `∫_{φ=0}^{2π} dφ = [φ]_0^{2π} = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n    *   `∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^{π} = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Multiplying the results:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\nTherefore, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`.\n\nThis result is a classic one in physics, related to Gauss's law for a point charge at the origin. The field `f(r) = r_hat / r^2` is the archetypal field of a point source, and its total divergence (or \"charge\") contained within any volume enclosing the origin is `4π`.\n\nComparing our result with the options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
