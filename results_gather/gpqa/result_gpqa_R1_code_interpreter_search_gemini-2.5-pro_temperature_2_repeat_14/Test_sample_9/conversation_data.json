    "*   **Analyze the options:**\n\n    *   **Option a:** An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet is essentially a model of Earth. Its density is a baseline value, approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   **Option b:** A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. The density is given and is very close to Earth's density.\n    *   **Option c:** A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. A fundamental principle of planetary science is that for planets with the same composition, the more massive the planet, the stronger its gravitational field. This stronger gravity compresses the planet's material more tightly, leading to a higher overall density. Therefore, a 5 Earth-mass planet made of the same \"stuff\" as Earth will be denser than Earth.\n    *   **Option d:** A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth. Following the same logic as option c, but in reverse, a less massive planet has weaker gravity. This results in less compression of its material compared to Earth. Consequently, its density will be lower than Earth's.\n\n*   **Compare the densities:**\n\n    *   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density(c) > Density(a) because it is more massive and thus more gravitationally compressed.\n    *   Density(d) < Density(a) because it is less massive and thus less gravitationally compressed.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    By comparing the options, the planet in option (c) is the only one guaranteed to be significantly denser than Earth due to increased gravitational compression from its high mass. The other planets have densities equal to or less than Earth's.\n\n<<<D>>>"
