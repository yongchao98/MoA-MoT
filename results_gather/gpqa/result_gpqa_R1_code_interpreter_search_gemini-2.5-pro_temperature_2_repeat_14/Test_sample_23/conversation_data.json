    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let's use atomic masses C ≈ 12 g/mol and H ≈ 1 g/mol.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`.\n*   Setting this equal to 14.28%, or 0.1428:\n    `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n    A more precise way is to recognize that 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (1 / 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    `7y = 12x + y`\n    `6y = 12x`\n    `y = 2x`\n*   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and the general formula is CnH2n.\n*   We are told Z is a hydrocarbon that does not react further with hydrogen. This means it is saturated.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". Among cycloalkanes, **cyclohexane (C6H12)** is a very common solvent. This fits the formula CnH2n (for n=6).\n*   Therefore, it is highly probable that **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one liquid in Y is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means both its components are saturated (no C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Hydrogenating cyclohexane (C6H12) will just yield cyclohexane.\n    *   The other component of Y, let's call it Y2, must also yield cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. And Y2 is saturated.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. A classic disproportionation of C6 cyclic compounds involves forming a fully saturated species (cyclohexane) and a fully unsaturated one (benzene).\n    `Reactant(s) --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n*   Let's hypothesize that **mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check if this fits the criteria for Y:\n    *   Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Benzene and cyclohexane are both liquids at room temperature. The reaction stoichiometry needs to be checked, but this is a plausible composition.\n    *   Does not decolorize bromine water: Neither benzene (under these conditions) nor cyclohexane reacts with bromine water. This fits.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z:\n        *   Cyclohexane + H2 → Cyclohexane (Z).\n        *   Benzene + 3H2 --(severe conditions)--> Cyclohexane (Z). This reaction requires severe conditions (high pressure/temperature), which matches the problem description. This fits.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that, upon disproportionation, forms mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene).\n*   This means the overall reaction is: `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12`\n*   Since the products are equimolar (1 mole of benzene and 1 mole of cyclohexane), the reactants X1 and X2 must also be equimolar (1 mole of X1 and 1 mole of X2).\n*   This reaction is a hydrogen transfer: one reactant loses hydrogen (is oxidized) and the other gains hydrogen (is reduced).\n*   The total number of atoms must be conserved. The products have (6+6)=12 Carbon atoms and (6+12)=18 Hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the reactants X1+X2 must also have a total of 12 Carbon and 18 Hydrogen atoms. Since all species are C6 based (as they all hydrogenate to cyclohexane), X1 and X2 must be C6 hydrocarbons. So, X1 is C6Ha and X2 is C6Hb, where a+b=18.\n*   X1 and X2 decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   A key constraint is that there are **no conjugated multiple bonds** in the compounds of mixture X.\n*   Let's propose reactants that would logically lead to the products.\n    *   The formation of benzene (C6H6) requires an H-donor. A likely candidate is a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The formation of cyclohexane (C6H12) requires an H-acceptor. A likely candidate is cyclohexene (C6H10).\n*   Let's test this pair: X1 = **Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** and X2 = **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**.\n    *   The hydrogen atoms sum to 8 + 10 = 18. This matches the products.\n    *   The reaction would be: `C6H8 + C6H10 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12`. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. Cyclohexadiene loses 2H to become benzene, and cyclohexene gains 2H to become cyclohexane.\n*   Let's check the constraints for X:\n    *   Decolorize bromine water: Both have double bonds. Yes.\n    *   No conjugated bonds: There are two isomers of cyclohexadiene: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem specifies no conjugated bonds, so X1 must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so it is not conjugated. This fits perfectly.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z:\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) + 2H2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12). Yes.\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) + H2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12). Yes.\n\nAll conditions are met with this scheme.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\nThe two liquids in mixture X are:\n1.  1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which has **8** hydrogen atoms.\n2.  Cyclohexene (C6H10), which has **10** hydrogen atoms.\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
