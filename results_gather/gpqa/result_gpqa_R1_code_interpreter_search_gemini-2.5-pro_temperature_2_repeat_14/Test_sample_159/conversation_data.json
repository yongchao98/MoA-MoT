    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture Geometry**\n    *   The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'.\n    *   The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side.\n    *   The question states that the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N → ∞).\n    *   As N approaches infinity, a regular polygon with a constant apothem approaches a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle.\n    *   Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Physics of the Problem**\n    *   The problem involves monochromatic light of wavelength λ passing through a circular aperture and observed in the far-field region. This is a classic case of Fraunhofer diffraction.\n    *   For a circular aperture, the resulting diffraction pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n    *   The intensity distribution of the Airy pattern as a function of the angle θ from the central axis is given by:\n        $I(\\theta) = I_0 \\left[ \\frac{2 J_1(k a \\sin\\theta)}{k a \\sin\\theta} \\right]^2$\n    *   Here, $I_0$ is the intensity at the center, 'a' is the radius of the aperture, $k = 2\\pi / \\lambda$ is the wave number, and $J_1$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n\n3.  **Determine the Position of the Minima**\n    *   The intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, which means $J_1(k a \\sin\\theta) = 0$.\n    *   Let $x = k a \\sin\\theta$. The minima correspond to the non-zero roots of the Bessel function $J_1(x)$.\n    *   The problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, so $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$.\n    *   The condition for the n-th minimum becomes $k a \\theta_n = x_{1,n}$, where $x_{1,n}$ is the n-th non-zero root of $J_1(x)$.\n    *   Substituting $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$, we get:\n        $\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} a \\theta_n = x_{1,n}$\n    *   Solving for the angular position $\\theta_n$:\n        $\\theta_n = \\frac{x_{1,n} \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\n4.  **Find the Numerical Values for the Minima Positions**\n    *   We need the values of the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function $J_1(x)$. These are well-known mathematical constants.\n    *   First non-zero root: $x_{1,1} \\approx 3.8317$\n    *   Second non-zero root: $x_{1,2} \\approx 7.0156$\n    *   Now, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima.\n    *   Position of the first minimum ($\\theta_1$):\n        $\\theta_1 = \\frac{x_{1,1} \\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\frac{3.8317}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda}{a} \\approx 0.6098 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n    *   Position of the second minimum ($\\theta_2$):\n        $\\theta_2 = \\frac{x_{1,2} \\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\frac{7.0156}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda}{a} \\approx 1.1166 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Angular Distance**\n    *   The question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This phrasing most naturally refers to the sequential minima on the same side of the central maximum, i.e., the first minimum (at $\\theta_1$) and the second minimum (at $\\theta_2$).\n    *   The angular distance is the difference between their positions: $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1$.\n    *   $\\Delta\\theta = \\left(\\frac{x_{1,2}}{2\\pi} - \\frac{x_{1,1}}{2\\pi}\\right) \\frac{\\lambda}{a} = \\frac{x_{1,2} - x_{1,1}}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n    *   Substituting the values:\n        $\\Delta\\theta = \\frac{7.0156 - 3.8317}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda}{a} = \\frac{3.1839}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n    *   $\\Delta\\theta \\approx 0.5067 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options**\n    *   The calculated value is approximately $0.5067 \\lambda/a$.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        A) $0.610 \\lambda / a$ (This is the position of the first minimum, $\\theta_1$)\n        B) $0.506 \\lambda / a$\n        C) $0.500 \\lambda / a$\n        D) $1.220 \\lambda /a$ (This is the angular width of the central maximum, $2\\theta_1$)\n    *   Our calculated value of $0.5067 \\lambda/a$ matches option B ($0.506 \\lambda/a$) very closely.\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculation with higher precision.\n```python\nimport scipy.special as sp\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Find the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function of the first kind, order 1 (J1)\n# sp.jn_zeros(1, 2) returns an array with the first 2 roots of J1.\nzeros = sp.jn_zeros(1, 2)\nx1_1 = zeros[0]  # First non-zero root\nx1_2 = zeros[1]  # Second non-zero root\n\n# The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima,\n# which is theta_2 - theta_1.\n# theta_n = (x1_n / (2 * pi)) * (lambda / a)\n# The coefficient for theta_1 is x1_1 / (2*pi)\n# The coefficient for theta_2 is x1_2 / (2*pi)\n# The coefficient for the difference is (x1_2 - x1_1) / (2*pi)\n\nangular_distance_coeff = (x1_2 - x1_1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"{angular_distance_coeff:.3f}\")\n```\n>>>\n0.507\n\nThe refined calculation gives 0.507, which confirms that 0.506 is the closest answer. The minor difference arises from the precision of the constants used in the option itself. Therefore, the interpretation of the question as the distance between the first and second minima ($\\theta_2 - \\theta_1$) is correct.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` will approach a circle of radius `a` as the number of sides `N` approaches infinity. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture is given by the Airy pattern:\n\n$I(\\theta) = I_0 \\left[ \\frac{2 J_1(k a \\sin\\theta)}{k a \\sin\\theta} \\right]^2$\n\nwhere:\n*   `I₀` is the maximum intensity at the center.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k` is the wave number, $k = 2\\pi / \\lambda$.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `θ` is the angle from the central axis.\n\nThe intensity minima (dark fringes) occur when the numerator is zero, which means $J_1(k a \\sin\\theta) = 0$. This happens when the argument of the Bessel function, $k a \\sin\\theta$, is equal to one of the non-zero roots of $J_1(x)$. Let these roots be denoted by $x_{1,n}$.\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation, $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$, the condition for the n-th minimum becomes:\n$k a \\theta_n = x_{1,n}$\n\nSubstituting $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$:\n$\\frac{2\\pi a}{\\lambda} \\theta_n = x_{1,n}$\n\nSolving for the angular position of the n-th minimum, $\\theta_n$:\n$\\theta_n = \\frac{x_{1,n} \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which is $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1$.\nThe first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function $J_1(x)$ are:\n*   First root, $x_{1,1} \\approx 3.8317$\n*   Second root, $x_{1,2} \\approx 7.0156$\n\nNow, we can find the positions of the first and second minima:\n*   Position of the first minimum: $\\theta_1 = \\frac{x_{1,1} \\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\frac{3.8317}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda}{a} \\approx 0.6098 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n*   Position of the second minimum: $\\theta_2 = \\frac{x_{1,2} \\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\frac{7.0156}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda}{a} \\approx 1.1166 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n\nThe angular distance between them is:\n$\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1 = (1.1166 - 0.6098) \\frac{\\lambda}{a} = 0.5068 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n\nThis can also be calculated as:\n$\\Delta\\theta = \\frac{(x_{1,2} - x_{1,1})\\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\frac{(7.0156 - 3.8317)\\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\frac{3.1839\\lambda}{2\\pi a} \\approx 0.5067 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) $0.610 \\lambda / a$ (This is the position of the first minimum, $\\theta_1$)\nB) $0.506 \\lambda / a$\nC) $0.500 \\lambda / a$\nD) $1.220 \\lambda /a$ (This is the angular diameter of the central maximum, $2\\theta_1$)\n\nThe calculated value of approximately $0.507 \\lambda/a$ matches option B most closely.\n\n<<<B>>>"
