    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the HPLC analysis.\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n       H   CH2CH2CH3\n        \\ /\n         C=C\n        / \\\n CH3CH2CH2   H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This reaction involves the *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   Reacting a *trans*-alkene via *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides. This is because the mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face of the alkene with equal probability.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These are trans-epoxides and are enantiomers of each other.\n*   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring opening with H₂O.** This is an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl groups across the original double bond location (one from the epoxide oxygen, one from water). The overall reaction (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is equivalent to *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   There is a general rule in stereochemistry: *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* compound.\n    *   Let's confirm this by tracing the mechanism:\n        *   The (4R,5R)-epoxide will open via backside attack by water. Attack at C4 gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Both (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) describe the same *meso* compound, as the molecule has propyl groups on both sides, allowing for a center of inversion and making it achiral.\n        *   Similarly, the (4S,5S)-epoxide will also exclusively yield the same *meso*-diol upon hydrolysis.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, the *meso*-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n         H      H\n          \\    /\n           C==C\n          /    \\\n   CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   *Syn*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a *meso* epoxide. This is because a plane of symmetry is maintained throughout the reaction.\n    *   The product is the single, achiral *meso*-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring opening with H₂O.** This is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   The general rule is: *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a *racemic* mixture of two enantiomers.\n    *   Let's confirm with the mechanism:\n        *   The *meso*-epoxide (achiral) is protonated. Water, an achiral nucleophile, attacks. Because the starting materials (meso-epoxide and water) are achiral, if the products are chiral, they must be formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n        *   Attack at the two different carbons of the protonated epoxide leads to the formation of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (let's call it **E1**) and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (let's call it **E2**).\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n*   **M:** *meso*-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n*   **E1:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   **E2:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nWhat are the relationships between these isomers?\n*   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of both **E1** and **E2**.\n\n### **4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers (**M** vs. **E1**/**E2**) have different physical properties and will separate.\n    *   Enantiomers (**E1** vs. **E2**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not separate. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks: one for compound **M**, and one for the co-eluting enantiomers **E1** and **E2**.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing them to be separated.\n    *   It will separate the diastereomers (**M** from **E1** and **E2**).\n    *   It will also separate the enantiomers **E1** from **E2**.\n    *   Since all three compounds (**M**, **E1**, **E2**) are chemically distinct and can be resolved by a chiral column, the chromatogram will show three separate peaks.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
