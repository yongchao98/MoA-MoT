    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (indicating two equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C=O). This is characteristic of maleic acid being dehydrated to maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride is a symmetric molecule, which accounts for the simple NMR spectra.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system at carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each of these carbons has a methyl group. Carbon 5 is a methylene (CH₂) group. This diene is also symmetric.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   This reaction is stereospecific and typically produces two stereoisomers when a cyclic diene is used: the *endo* product and the *exo* product.\n    *   According to the Alder rule, Diels-Alder reactions under kinetic control (which is the usual case) favor the formation of the *endo* product. Therefore, the *endo* adduct is the major product, and the *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products and Their Symmetry:**\n    *   The reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene framework with a fused anhydride ring.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of both the diene and the dienophile, the products (*endo* and *exo*) will each possess a plane of symmetry (Cₛ). This symmetry plane bisects the C=C double bond, the C7 methylene bridge, and the anhydride group.\n    *   This symmetry makes pairs of protons and methyl groups chemically equivalent. In the ¹H NMR spectrum, we expect to see:\n        *   One singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C5, C6). Let's call these **Me_alkene**. These are vinylic methyls and should have a chemical shift around 1.6-2.0 ppm. This is a **6H singlet**.\n        *   One singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4). Let's call these **Me_bridgehead**. These are methyls on saturated carbons and should appear upfield, around 1.0-1.3 ppm. This is another **6H singlet**.\n        *   One singlet for the two equivalent protons on the carbons carrying the anhydride ring (C2, C3). Let's call these **H_anhydride**. These protons are alpha to two carbonyl groups and should be downfield, around 3-4 ppm. This is a **2H singlet**.\n        *   The two protons of the C7 methylene bridge (H_syn and H_anti) are diastereotopic. They will couple to each other, giving rise to two **1H doublets** (an AB quartet), unless they are accidentally isochronous (have the same chemical shift).\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find an interaction that is unique to the *endo* geometry.\n    *   Let's visualize the 3D structures:\n        *   In the **endo adduct (major product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the C5-C6 double bond. This arrangement brings the **H_anhydride** protons (at C2 and C3) very close to the **Me_alkene** groups (at C5 and C6). A strong NOE between these two groups is expected.\n        *   In the **exo adduct (minor product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C5-C6 double bond. This moves the **H_anhydride** protons far from the **Me_alkene** groups. Therefore, the corresponding NOE would be absent or very weak.\n    *   This confirms that the distinguishing cross-peak connects the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_alkene** protons.\n\n5.  **Match the Analysis to the Options:**\n    *   The cross-peak connects the signal for H_anhydride with the signal for Me_alkene.\n    *   Signal for H_anhydride: A **2H singlet** with a chemical shift around 3.5 ppm.\n    *   Signal for Me_alkene: A **6H singlet** with a chemical shift around 1.7 ppm.\n    *   Now we look at the choices:\n        *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\n    *   Option C perfectly matches our findings: a cross-peak between the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride). The chemical shifts are also very plausible for these groups.\n\n<<<C>>>"
