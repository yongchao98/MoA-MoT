    "*   **Analyze the protein's normal function:** The transcription factor subunit requires three steps to become active: 1) Phosphorylation, 2) Dimerization (forming a pair with another subunit), and 3) Nuclear translocation to activate genes. All steps are essential.\n*   **Define Dominant-Negative Mutation:** A dominant-negative mutation occurs when a mutant protein not only loses its own function but also interferes with the function of the normal (wild-type) protein produced from the other, healthy allele. This is different from a simple recessive mutation, where the presence of one good allele is enough for normal function. The \"dominant\" part means its effect is seen even in a heterozygote. The \"negative\" part means it blocks the function of the wild-type protein.\n*   **Analyze Mutation Y:** Mutation Y is in the dimerization domain. In a heterozygous individual, the cell produces both wild-type (WT) subunits and mutant (Y) subunits. Because the mutation is in the dimerization domain, but still allows for interference, the most likely scenario is that the mutant Y subunit can still form a dimer with a WT subunit.\n*   **Evaluate the consequence:**\n    *   Three types of dimers can form: WT-WT, WT-Y, and Y-Y.\n    *   WT-WT dimers are fully functional.\n    *   Y-Y dimers are non-functional.\n    *   WT-Y heterodimers are the key. Because the Y subunit is part of the dimer, the entire complex is rendered non-functional. The Y subunit \"poisons\" the WT subunit it pairs with.\n*   **Evaluate the options based on the dominant-negative mechanism:**\n    *   A) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype: While possible, aggregation is a specific outcome. The core of a dominant-negative effect is the interference with the wild-type protein, which leads to a loss-of-function. The mechanism in D is more specific and common.\n    *   B) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype: This is incorrect. The mutation is \"negative,\" meaning it causes a loss of function, not a gain of function (like being constitutively active).\n    *   C) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype: This is incorrect. If the mutation prevented dimerization altogether, the mutant protein wouldn't be able to interfere with the wild-type protein. The wild-type subunits could still form functional WT-WT dimers. This would result in a recessive mutation, not a dominant-negative one.\n    *   **D) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most plausible mechanism for a dominant-negative effect in this context. The malformed WT-Y heterodimer is often recognized by cellular quality control systems (like the ubiquitin-proteasome system) as abnormal and is targeted for degradation. By sequestering the functional WT protein into an unstable complex that gets destroyed, the mutant Y protein effectively causes the functional loss of the wild-type allele's protein product. This leads to a strong loss-of-function phenotype, which is the hallmark of a dominant-negative mutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
