    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the star's properties and the planet's distance from the star. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n4.  **Find the Semi-major Axis (a):** The semi-major axis `a` is not given directly. We must derive it from the radial velocity (RV) data. The Doppler shift (Δλ) allows us to find the star's maximum radial velocity (K), also known as the RV semi-amplitude.\n\n    The relationship between Doppler shift and radial velocity is:\n    K = v_max = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\n    where `c` is the speed of light, Δλ_max is the maximum shift, and λ_0 is the rest wavelength.\n\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    K_1 / K_2 = (c * Δλ_1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ_2 / λ_0) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n    K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\n5.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit detected via the transit method (implying inclination i ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1), the star's RV semi-amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a) by the following formula (assuming M_p << M_star):\n    K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n6.  **Solve for 'a' in terms of K:**\n    K^2 ≈ M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ G * M_p^2 / (M_star * K^2)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-major Axes (a_2 / a_1):**\n    a_2 / a_1 = [G * M_p2^2 / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [G * M_p1^2 / (M_star * K_1^2)]\n\n    The gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_1^2)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\n8.  **Substitute the Known Ratios:**\n    *   Mass ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5/7\n    *   RV amplitude ratio: K_1 / K_2 = 3/4\n\n    Now substitute these into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2\n    a_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n10. **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    To get the final numerical answer, we perform the division.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the square root of the inverse ratio of the semi-major axes.\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes a_2 / a_1 can be found from the given data.\n# a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\n# Given planet masses:\nM_p1 = 7  # in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5  # in Earth masses\n\n# Given Doppler shifts (proportional to K):\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03  # in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04  # in Angstroms\n\n# Calculate the ratios\nmass_ratio_2_over_1 = M_p2 / M_p1\nK_ratio_1_over_2 = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of semi-major axes\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (mass_ratio_2_over_1)**2 * (K_ratio_1_over_2)**2\n\n# Calculate the final temperature ratio\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed result confirms the manual calculation. 15 divided by 28 is approximately 0.5357.\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, most terms in the ratio cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a_2 / a_1. We can derive this from the radial velocity (RV) information.\n\nThe star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max) by:\nK = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength. Since `c` and λ_0 are the same for both measurements, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is simply the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\nK_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit (as stated) and an edge-on view (implied by the transit detection method, so sin(i) ≈ 1), the RV semi-amplitude is given by (assuming the planet's mass M_p is much smaller than the star's mass M_star):\nK ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nWe can solve this for the semi-major axis, `a`:\nK^2 ≈ (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_1^2)]\n\nThe gravitational constant G and the star's mass M_star cancel out:\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n*   K_1 / K_2 = 3 / 4\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = (5 M_earth / 7 M_earth)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\na_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2\na_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
