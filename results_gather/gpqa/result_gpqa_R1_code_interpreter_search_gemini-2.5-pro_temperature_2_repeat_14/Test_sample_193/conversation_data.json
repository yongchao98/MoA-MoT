    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the System and its States**\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take one of two values: +1 or -1.\nThe total number of possible configurations (microstates) of the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\nLet's list all 8 possible states:\n1.  (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1)\n2.  (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1)\n3.  (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1)\n4.  (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1)\n5.  (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n6.  (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1)\n7.  (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1)\n8.  (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n\n**2. Write Down the Energy Equation**\nThe energy of the system for any given state is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy for Each State**\nWe need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 microstates. To do this, we first calculate the term `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3`.\n\n*   **State 1: (+1, +1, +1)**\n    `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E1 = -J(3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 8: (-1, -1, -1)**\n    `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E8 = -J(3) = -3J\n\n*   **States with two spins up and one spin down:**\n    Let's take State 2: (+1, +1, -1).\n    `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    E2 = -J(-1) = +J\n    By symmetry, the states (+1, -1, +1) (State 3) and (-1, +1, +1) (State 4) will also have the same energy. Let's check State 3:\n    `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` = (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    E3 = -J(-1) = +J\n    So, there are 3 states with energy E = +J.\n\n*   **States with one spin up and two spins down:**\n    Let's take State 5: (+1, -1, -1).\n    `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` = (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    E5 = -J(-1) = +J\n    By symmetry, the states (-1, +1, -1) (State 6) and (-1, -1, +1) (State 7) will also have this energy. Let's check State 6:\n    `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    E6 = -J(-1) = +J\n    So, these 3 states also have energy E = +J.\n\n**4. Group the States by Energy Level (Degeneracy)**\nWe have found two distinct energy levels in the system:\n*   **Energy Level E_A = -3J:** This level corresponds to the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1). The degeneracy (number of states) for this level is g_A = 2.\n*   **Energy Level E_B = +J:** This level corresponds to the other 6 states (all configurations with two spins of one sign and one of the other). The degeneracy for this level is g_B = 6.\n\n**5. Calculate the Partition Function (Z)**\nThe canonical partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states, which can be written as a sum over the energy levels, taking degeneracy into account:\nZ = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i)\nwhere `i` sums over the distinct energy levels, g_i is the degeneracy of the i-th level, E_i is the energy of the i-th level, and β = 1/(kT).\n\nPlugging in our values:\nZ = (g_A * e^(-βE_A)) + (g_B * e^(-βE_B))\nZ = (2 * e^(-β(-3J))) + (6 * e^(-β(+J)))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**6. Match the Result with the Given Options**\nOur calculated partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ).\nLet's compare this with the provided options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nC) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
