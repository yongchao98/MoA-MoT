    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step radiative decay from the excited state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ of a hydrogen atom to its ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via an intermediate state through two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n*   **Parity Change:** The parity of the state, given by $(-1)^l$, must change. This is ensured by the `l` selection rule.\n*   **Angular Momentum Quantum Number `l`:** $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Magnetic Quantum Number `m`:** $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   There is no strict rule for the principal quantum number `n`, but for a decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n**2. First Transition: from |3,0,0> to an Intermediate State**\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$, where $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Intermediate State:** Let's call it $|n'', l'', m''\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the selection rules for `l`:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l'' - l = l'' - 0 = \\pm 1$.\n    *   Since $l''$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l'' = 1$.\n*   Applying the selection rules for `m`:\n    *   $\\Delta m = m'' - m = m'' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are $m'' = -1, 0, 1$.\n*   For the principal quantum number `n`, the process is a two-step cascade from $n=3$ to $n=1$. This implies the intermediate state must have $n''=2$.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are:\n*   $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$\n*   $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$\n*   $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$\n\n**3. Second Transition: from Intermediate State to |1,0,0>**\n\nNow, let's check if the transitions from these possible intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ are allowed.\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$, where $n=1, l=0, m=0$.\n*   For any of the intermediate states $|2, 1, m''\\rangle$:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l'' = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m'' = 0 - m'' = -m''$. Since $m'' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, the possible values for $\\Delta m$ are $+1, 0, -1$, all of which are allowed.\n\nSo, all three transition routes are physically possible:\n*   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n\nThe probability of a specific route occurring is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. This is because once the atom is in one of the intermediate $|2,1,m''\\rangle$ states, it has only one allowed dipole decay channel to reach the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nThe transition rate $\\Gamma$ for spontaneous emission from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the electric dipole operator $\\mathbf{r}$:\n$\\Gamma_{i \\to f} \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe operator $\\mathbf{r}$ can be decomposed into spherical tensor components $r_q$ (where $q=\\Delta m$):\n*   $r_{+1} \\propto (x+iy)$ corresponds to $\\Delta m = +1$.\n*   $r_0 \\propto z$ corresponds to $\\Delta m = 0$.\n*   $r_{-1} \\propto (x-iy)$ corresponds to $\\Delta m = -1$.\n\nThe matrix element can be separated into a radial part and an angular part. The angular part is described by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n$\\Gamma(|n,l,m\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle) \\propto |R_{n'l' \\leftarrow nl}|^2 \\times |\\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m' \\rangle|^2$, where $q = m' - m$.\n\nLet's calculate the relative rates for the first transition, from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the three possible intermediate states:\n*   The radial integral $R_{2,1 \\leftarrow 3,0}$ is the same for all three transitions because it only depends on the quantum numbers $(n,l)$ and $(n',l')$, not on $m$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the angular part for each path:\n1.  **To $|2,1,-1\\rangle$:** $m'' = -1$. We need $q = \\Delta m = -1 - 0 = -1$.\n    Rate $\\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,-1 | 1,-1 \\rangle|^2$.\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding an angular momentum of 0 to any other angular momentum is always 1 (i.e., $\\langle l_1, m_1; 0, 0 | l_1, m_1 \\rangle = 1$).\n    So, the angular part squared is $1^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **To $|2,1,0\\rangle$:** $m'' = 0$. We need $q = \\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$.\n    Rate $\\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,0 | 1,0 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n\n3.  **To $|2,1,1\\rangle$:** $m'' = 1$. We need $q = \\Delta m = 1 - 0 = 1$.\n    Rate $\\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,1 | 1,1 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n\nSince both the radial and angular parts are identical for the three possible transitions, the transition rates are equal. Let's call the rate $\\Gamma_0$.\n*   $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma_0$\n*   $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma_0$\n*   $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma_0$\n\nThe total transition rate out of $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (to the $2p$ shell) is $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n\nThe probability (or branching ratio) for each path is the rate for that path divided by the total rate:\nProbability(path) = $\\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, each of the three possible routes has a probability of $1/3$.\n\n**5. Match with Options**\nLet's check the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - Correct path and correct probability.\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - Incorrect probability.\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
