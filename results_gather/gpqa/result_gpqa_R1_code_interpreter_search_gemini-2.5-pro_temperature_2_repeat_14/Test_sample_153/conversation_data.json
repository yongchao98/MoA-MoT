    "Here's a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotope of each element.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion. Its relative intensity is 32% compared to the M⁺ peak (100%).\n*   **Interpretation:** This M⁺ and M+2 pattern, with an approximate intensity ratio of 3:1 (100:32), is a definitive indicator for the presence of a single **chlorine** atom in the molecule. This is due to the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes: ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formulas of the options.\n    *   All four options (Phenyl chloroformate, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, and 4-chlorobenzoic acid) have the molecular formula **C₇H₅ClO₂**.\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35.5) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5 g/mol. This is consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band that results from the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid**. The significant broadening is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This allows us to eliminate options A (Phenyl chloroformate, which is an acid halide) and B (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which is an aldehyde with a phenol). We are left with options C and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. It is a singlet because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). We see two distinct signals, both appearing as doublets and each representing two protons. This splitting pattern is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. In a para-substituted ring, symmetry makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent chemically equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n\n**4. Final Structure Determination:**\n\n*   We have narrowed the possibilities down to 2-chlorobenzoic acid (ortho-substituted) and 4-chlorobenzoic acid (para-substituted).\n*   The ¹H NMR spectrum clearly shows the symmetrical pattern of a **para-substituted** ring. A 2-chlorobenzoic acid (ortho) would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n*   Therefore, the structure must be 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:** All spectral data are consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
