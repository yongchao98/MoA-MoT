    "An electron in a p orbital has an orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$. The possible values for the z-component of the orbital angular momentum are given by the magnetic quantum number $m_l$, which can take values $m_l = -1, 0, 1$. The corresponding eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m_l \\hbar$.\n\nThe problem states we have a system of two electrons, both in a p orbital state, so $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\nThe system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$. Here, $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $m=-1$ is the magnetic quantum number for the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nThe total orbital angular momentum is the vector sum of the individual angular momenta: $\\vec{L} = \\vec{L_1} + \\vec{L_2}$.\nConsequently, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n\nThe state $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with a well-defined eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. This means that if we were to measure the total z-component of angular momentum, we would get the value $-\\hbar$ with a probability of 1.\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\nThis corresponds to a measurement outcome where:\n*   Electron 1 has $m_{l1} = -1$.\n*   Electron 2 has $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nIf this outcome were to occur, the total z-component of angular momentum for the system would be the sum of the individual components:\n$m_{total} = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\nThis implies that a measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum would yield an eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$.\n\nHowever, the system is initially in the state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$, which is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with an eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. A fundamental principle of quantum mechanics states that for a system in an eigenstate of an observable, any measurement of that observable will always yield the corresponding eigenvalue. In this case, a measurement of the total z-angular momentum $L_z$ *must* yield $-1\\hbar$.\n\nThe proposed measurement outcome (where $L_{1z}=-\\hbar$ and $L_{2z}=-\\hbar$) would result in a total z-angular momentum of $-2\\hbar$. This violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, as the system has a definite total z-component of $-1\\hbar$. Therefore, the probability of this outcome must be zero.\n\n**Formal Approach using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\n\nThe coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$ (or $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$ for short).\n$|l,m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_{l1},m_{l2}} \\langle l_1,m_{l1}; l_2,m_{l2} | l,m \\rangle |m_{l1},m_{l2}\\rangle$\nThe terms $\\langle l_1,m_{l1}; l_2,m_{l2} | l,m \\rangle$ are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. A key property (selection rule) of these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\nWe want to find the probability of measuring the state $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$. This probability is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto this final state:\n$P = |\\langle m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe amplitude $\\langle m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle$ is simply the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1,-1; 1,-1 | 2,-1 \\rangle$.\nFor this coefficient:\n*   $m = -1$\n*   $m_{l1} = -1$\n*   $m_{l2} = -1$\nThe sum is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\nSince $m \\neq m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ (i.e., $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
