    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 ($L_1$) to that of Star_2 ($L_2$), which is $L_1/L_2$.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Formula:** The stars are assumed to be black bodies. The luminosity of a spherical black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\sigma T^4$\n    where A is the surface area ($A=4\\pi R^2$), $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, R is the radius, and T is the surface temperature.\n    So, $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n\n3.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars as:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use Given Radius Information:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, so $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, or $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n    Substituting this into the equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$.\n\n5.  **Relate Temperature and Wavelength:** The temperature of a black body is related to its peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{emitted}$) by Wien's Displacement Law:\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{emitted}$\n    where b is Wien's displacement constant.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    $T_1 / T_2 = (b / \\lambda_{emitted,1}) / (b / \\lambda_{emitted,2}) = \\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1}$\n\n6.  **Account for Doppler Shift:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same. The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is affected by the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) due to the Doppler effect. The non-relativistic formula for the Doppler shift is:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + v_r/c)$\n    where c is the speed of light. This means the emitted wavelength is $\\lambda_{emitted} = \\lambda_{obs} / (1 + v_r/c)$.\n\n7.  **Apply Doppler Shift to Each Star:**\n    *   **For Star_1:** $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s. Therefore, there is no Doppler shift.\n        $\\lambda_{emitted,1} = \\lambda_{obs,1} / (1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{obs,1}$\n    *   **For Star_2:** $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s.\n        $\\lambda_{emitted,2} = \\lambda_{obs,2} / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n8.  **Find the Temperature Ratio:** We are given that the observed wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$. Let's call this value $\\lambda_{obs}$.\n    Now we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths:\n    $\\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1} = [\\lambda_{obs} / (1 + v_{r2}/c)] / \\lambda_{obs} = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    Since $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1}$, we have:\n    $T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation from step 4:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 \\cdot [1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)]^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)^4$\n    The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n10. **Compute the Numerical Value:** Now, we plug in the values $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 299792.458$ km/s. We can use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc = 299792.458\n# Radial velocity of Star 2 in km/s\nv_r2 = 700\n# Radius ratio R1/R2\nR_ratio = 1.5\n\n# As derived, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is (R1/R2)^2 / (1 + v_r2/c)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R_ratio**2) / ((1 + v_r2 / c)**4)\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n\n2.229199996515233\n\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.2292. This value is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The final calculated value is ~2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~2.25\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>"
