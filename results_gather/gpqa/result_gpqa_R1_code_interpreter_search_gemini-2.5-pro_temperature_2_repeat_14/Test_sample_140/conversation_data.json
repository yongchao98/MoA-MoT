    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is a source of the very strong base, the amide ion (:NH₂⁻).\n    *   The reaction conditions (an aryl halide with a strong base and no strongly electron-withdrawing groups) are characteristic of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) acts as a base and removes a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine at C1).\n    *   There are two *ortho* positions: C2 and C6.\n    *   At C2, there is a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   At C6, there is a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The base can abstract either the deuteron from C2 or the proton from C6.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6:**\n        *   The base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. A lone pair is formed on C6. This lone pair then forms a triple bond between C6 and C1, expelling the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n        *   The resulting intermediate is a benzyne where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is called **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n        *   This pathway is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect, KIE). This will be the major pathway.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2:**\n        *   The base can also remove the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. A lone pair forms on C2, which then forms a triple bond between C2 and C1, expelling the bromide ion.\n        *   The resulting intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom has been removed from the ring. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** (C₆H₄).\n        *   This pathway is slower due to the KIE, but it is still a possible reaction, so it contributes to the pool of possible products.\n\n    *   Conclusion of Step 1: Two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deutero-benzyne (major) and benzyne (minor).\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition - Reaction of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The highly reactive benzyne intermediates are then attacked by a nucleophile. In this reaction, the amide ion (:NH₂⁻) also acts as the nucleophile. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n    *   **Reaction of 3-deutero-benzyne:**\n        *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and a deuterium is at C2.\n        *   The nucleophile (:NH₂⁻) can attack either C1 or C6 of the triple bond.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1, creating a carbanion at C6. This carbanion is protonated by an ammonia molecule (NH₃). The product has an -NH₂ group at C1 and a deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6, creating a carbanion at C1. This carbanion is protonated by NH₃. The product has an -NH₂ group at C6 and a deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the #1 position, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   So, the 3-deutero-benzyne intermediate leads to two distinct products.\n\n    *   **Reaction of Benzyne (non-deuterated):**\n        *   This intermediate (C₆H₄) is symmetrical.\n        *   Attack by :NH₂⁻ on either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation by NH₃, leads to the same single product.\n        *   The product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), with no deuterium.\n\n4.  **Final Count of Possible Products:**\n    *   Let's list all the unique organic products formed from all possible pathways:\n        1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\n    *   These three molecules are structurally distinct isomers. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\nThe correct choice is D, which corresponds to 3 possible products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
