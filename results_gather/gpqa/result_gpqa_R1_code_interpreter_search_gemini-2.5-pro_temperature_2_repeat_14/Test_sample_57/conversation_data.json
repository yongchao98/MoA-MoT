    "*   **Analysis of the Options:**\n    *   **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)** is a quantum field theory (QFT) that describes the interactions of light and matter. In QED, calculations involving loop diagrams (virtual particle-antiparticle pairs) lead to integrals that diverge at high energies (ultraviolet divergences). To obtain finite, physically meaningful results, these infinities must be dealt with through a process called regularization, followed by renormalization. Therefore, QED requires regularization.\n    *   **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)** is the QFT for the strong nuclear force. Similar to QED, it is a gauge theory, and its loop calculations also produce ultraviolet divergences that necessitate regularization and renormalization. Thus, QCD also requires regularization.\n    *   **Classical Electrodynamics**, while not a quantum theory, suffers from its own high-energy problem. When calculating the self-energy of a classical point charge, the energy of its electric field diverges as one approaches the point (r -> 0). This is an infinite energy density at a single point, which is a form of high-energy divergence. To make the energy finite, one must \"regularize\" the theory, for instance, by assuming the charge is not a point but is spread over a small, finite radius.\n    *   **Superstring Theory** is a theoretical framework that replaces point-like particles of particle physics with one-dimensional extended objects called strings. A key feature and a primary motivation for string theory is that it is believed to be free from ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences. The interactions between strings are not point-like; they are \"smeared out.\" This smearing effect effectively introduces a natural cutoff at the string scale, preventing the loop integrals from diverging at high energies. As a result, string theory is considered UV-finite and does not require the ad-hoc process of regularization needed in QFTs like QED and QCD.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Of the given options, only Superstring Theory is constructed in a way that is inherently free from high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences, thus not requiring regularization.\n\n<<<A>>>"
