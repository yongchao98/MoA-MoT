    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the core principle:** The question asks for the uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$) given the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$). This points directly to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n2.  **Choose the relevant form of the Uncertainty Principle:** The primary form relates position and momentum:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p_x \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    where:\n    *   $\\Delta x$ is the uncertainty in position.\n    *   $\\Delta p_x$ is the uncertainty in momentum in the x-direction.\n    *   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s).\n\n    For estimation of the *minimum* uncertainty, we can use the approximation:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p_x \\approx \\hbar$\n\n3.  **Calculate the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p_x$):** We are given $\\Delta x = 0.1$ nm. First, convert this to SI units:\n    $\\Delta x = 0.1 \\text{ nm} = 0.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m} = 10^{-10} \\text{ m}$.\n\n    Now, we can find the minimum uncertainty in momentum:\n    $\\Delta p_x \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}}{10^{-10} \\text{ m}} = 1.054 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg·m/s}$.\n\n4.  **Relate uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p_x$) to uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$):**\n    We need a relationship between energy (E) and momentum (p). The electron is traveling at $v = 2 \\times 10^8$ m/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light ($c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s). Therefore, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n    where $m_0$ is the rest mass of the electron.\n\n    To find the relationship between small uncertainties ($\\Delta E$ and $\\Delta p$), we can differentiate this equation. Treating the uncertainties as differentials ($dE \\approx \\Delta E$ and $dp \\approx \\Delta p$):\n    $d(E^2) = d((pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2)$\n    $2E \\cdot dE = 2p c^2 \\cdot dp$\n    $dE = \\frac{p c^2}{E} dp$\n\n    From special relativity, we also know that $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$ and $p = \\gamma m_0 v$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor. Substituting these into our derivative expression:\n    $\\frac{p c^2}{E} = \\frac{(\\gamma m_0 v) c^2}{\\gamma m_0 c^2} = v$\n\n    So, we get the elegant result:\n    $dE = v \\cdot dp$\n    Or, in terms of uncertainties:\n    $\\Delta E \\approx v \\cdot \\Delta p_x$\n\n5.  **Calculate the final uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$):**\n    Now we can substitute the values we have:\n    *   $v = 2 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   $\\Delta p_x \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-24}$ kg·m/s\n\n    $\\Delta E \\approx (2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (1.054 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg·m/s})$\n    $\\Delta E \\approx 2.108 \\times 10^{-16}$ J\n\n6.  **Compare with the options:** The calculated value is approximately $2.1 \\times 10^{-16}$ J. This falls into the order of magnitude of $10^{-16}$ J.\n    *   A) ~$10^{-16}$ J\n    *   B) ~$10^{-18}$ J\n    *   C) ~$10^{-19}$ J\n    *   D) ~$10^{-17}$ J\n\n    The result matches option A.\n\nLet's use a Python script to confirm the calculation precisely.\n```python\n# Constants\nv = 2e8  # Speed of the electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1e-9  # Uncertainty in position in meters (0.1 nm)\nhbar = 1.05457e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J·s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum using Heisenberg's principle\n# delta_p_x ≈ hbar / delta_x\ndelta_p_x = hbar / delta_x\n\n# Step 2: Relate energy and momentum uncertainty\n# For a relativistic particle, dE/dp = v, so ΔE ≈ v * Δp\ndelta_E = v * delta_p_x\n\nprint(f\"Uncertainty in momentum, Δp_x ≈ {delta_p_x:.4e} kg·m/s\")\nprint(f\"Minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE ≈ {delta_E:.4e} J\")\n```",
    "The code output confirms the calculation.\nThe uncertainty in momentum is $\\Delta p_x \\approx 1.0546 \\times 10^{-24}$ kg·m/s.\nThe minimum uncertainty in energy is $\\Delta E \\approx v \\cdot \\Delta p_x$.\nUsing the calculated value from the python script:\n$\\Delta E \\approx 2.1091 \\times 10^{-16}$ J.\n\nThis value is on the order of magnitude of $10^{-16}$ J.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~$10^{-16}$ J\nB) ~$10^{-18}$ J\nC) ~$10^{-19}$ J\nD) ~$10^{-17}$ J\n\nThe calculated value $2.1091 \\times 10^{-16}$ J is best approximated by option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
