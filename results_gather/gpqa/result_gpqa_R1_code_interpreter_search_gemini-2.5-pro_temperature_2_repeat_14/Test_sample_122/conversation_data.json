    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference:**\n*   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled by the ejecta.\n*   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\n*   Relative velocity between the frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Time elapsed in the moving ejecta frame, `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the *proper time* because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in its own frame (the ejecta).\n*   The speed of light, `c` ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n**3. The Goal:**\n*   Calculate the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n**4. The Physics:**\n*   The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame.\n*   According to the principle of time dilation, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for events happening in a moving frame (the ejecta) than the time measured in the moving frame itself (`Δt'`).\n*   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**5. Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    The formula is `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, plug this into the gamma formula:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (Δt).**\n    Using the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (d).**\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n*   **Step 4: Compute the final value.**\n    We can use a calculator to find the numerical value.\n\nHere is a Python script to perform the calculation precisely:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants\nv = 60000  # km/s\nc = 300000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s (proper time in the ejecta frame)\n\n# Calculate the beta factor (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the dilated time (time in the Galaxy frame)\ndt_galaxy = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance in the Galaxy frame\ndistance_galaxy = v * dt_galaxy\n\nprint(f\"{distance_galaxy=}\")\n```\n>>>\ndistance_galaxy=3061862.178478446\n>>>\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n\n**6. Compare with the Options:**\n*   A) 3,000,000 km (This is the non-relativistic answer, `d = v * Δt'`)\n*   B) 3,060,000 km\n*   C) 2,940,000 km\n*   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option B, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is likely due to the options being rounded. The intended calculation might have involved rounding the Lorentz factor (`γ ≈ 1.0206` rounded to `1.02`), which would give `d = 1.02 * (60,000 * 50) = 3,060,000` km exactly.\n\nThus, the correct answer is the one that accounts for time dilation.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically concerning time dilation.\n\n**1. Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Frames of Reference:** We have two inertial frames of reference. Let's call the Galaxy's reference frame S and the supernova ejecta's reference frame S'.\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time that has passed in the ejecta's frame (S') is `Δt' = 50 s`. Since this time is measured in the frame that is moving, it is the *proper time*.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n*   **Objective:** We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n*   **Physical Principles:**\n    1.  The distance in the Galaxy frame (S) is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    2.  Due to time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame S (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval `Δt` than the proper time `Δt'` measured in the moving frame S' (the ejecta).\n    3.  The relationship between `Δt` and `Δt'` is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    4.  The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n**2. Calculation:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (Δt).**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (d).**\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nThe code execution calculated this value as `3,061,862.17... km`.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\n*   The calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n*   Let's compare this with the given options:\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km (This is the incorrect classical calculation: `60,000 * 50`).\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n*   The value `3,061,862 km` is very close to option B, `3,060,000 km`. The difference is due to rounding in the problem's options. Therefore, the physically correct answer is represented by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
