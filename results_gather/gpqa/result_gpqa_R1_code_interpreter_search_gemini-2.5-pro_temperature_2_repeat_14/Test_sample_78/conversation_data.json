    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the product from the given NMR data.**\n    *   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): These two signals indicate the presence of two isolated methyl (CH3) groups. One is likely an acetyl methyl (-COCH3) and the other is an aromatic methyl (Ar-CH3).\n        *   δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d): This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The different chemical shifts suggest one substituent is electron-donating (e.g., -CH3) and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n        *   δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d): These are two doublets, each for one proton, in the vinylic region. They are coupled to each other, indicating a -CH=CH- group. The large chemical shifts, especially δ 7.68, suggest they are part of a conjugated system, likely an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n        *   δ 197.7 (1C, s): Confirms the presence of a ketone carbonyl group (C=O).\n        *   δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s): These correspond to the two methyl carbons.\n        *   The signals between δ 126.9 and δ 130.3 account for the six CH carbons (4 aromatic and 2 vinylic).\n        *   The signals at δ 141.5 and δ 144.1 are quaternary carbons, corresponding to the two ipso-carbons on the para-substituted ring.\n    *   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n        *   The data points to a molecule with a para-methylphenyl (p-tolyl) group and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n        *   These groups are connected by a -CH=CH- bridge, forming an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n        *   The structure is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n        *   Structure: `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`.\n        *   This structure has a molecular formula of C11H12O, which matches the starting material. This confirms the reaction is an isomerization.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the starting material (Compound X) that would rearrange to form this product.**\n    *   The reaction is an isomerization of Compound X (C11H12O) to 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The reaction is conducted with a base (DABCO) at high temperature, which are conditions known to promote rearrangements of epoxides.\n    *   Let's examine the options provided, which are all vinylic epoxides.\n\n    *   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound has a phenyl group (`-C6H5`), not a p-tolyl group (`p-CH3-C6H4-`). Its rearrangement would not yield a product with a p-tolyl group. So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** The molecular formula is C10H10O, which does not match the C11H12O of Compound X. So, B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:**\n        *   The structure is `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-[epoxide ring]`.\n        *   The molecular formula is C11H12O. This matches.\n        *   This compound possesses the necessary p-tolyl group and the correct number of remaining atoms.\n        *   The rearrangement of a vinylic terminal epoxide (`-CH(O)CH2`) to a methyl ketone (`-C(=O)CH3`) is a known chemical transformation.\n        *   `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2` (Compound C) → `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3` (Product). This is a perfect match.\n\n    *   **D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This compound has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Its rearrangement cannot form the identified product. So, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The product of the reaction is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The only starting material among the options that could rearrange to form this product is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
