    "Answering this question requires us to calculate the ratio of the transit probabilities for the two planets.\n\n**1. Transit Probability Formula**\n\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star, for a circular orbit, is given by the formula:\n*   P_transit = R_s / a\nwhere:\n*   `R_s` is the radius of the host star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities**\n\nWe are not given the semi-major axis (`a`) directly, but we can relate it to the orbital period (`P`) and the host star's mass (`M_s`) using Kepler's Third Law. The simplified form (since a planet's mass is negligible compared to its star's) is:\n*   P² ∝ a³ / M_s\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis (`a`):\n*   a³ ∝ M_s * P²\n*   a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)\n\n**3. Combining Formulas**\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for `a` into our transit probability formula:\n*   P_transit ∝ R_s / (M_s * P²)^(1/3)\n*   P_transit ∝ R_s * M_s^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)\n\n**4. Setting up the Ratio**\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the probability of Planet_1 transiting to the probability of Planet_2 transiting (P_transit1 / P_transit2):\n*   Ratio = (R_s1 * M_s1^(-1/3) * P1^(-2/3)) / (R_s2 * M_s2^(-1/3) * P2^(-2/3))\n\n**5. Plugging in the Given Values**\n\nLet's use the relationships provided in the problem:\n*   The host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`\n*   The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`\n*   The period of Planet_1 is one-third that of Planet_2: `P1 = P2 / 3`\n\nSubstituting these into our ratio equation:\n*   Ratio = (R_s2 * (2 * M_s2)^(-1/3) * (P2 / 3)^(-2/3)) / (R_s2 * M_s2^(-1/3) * P2^(-2/3))\n\n**6. Simplifying the Expression**\n\nWe can cancel out the `R_s2`, `M_s2^(-1/3)`, and `P2^(-2/3)` terms from the numerator and denominator:\n*   Ratio = (2^(-1/3) * (1/3)^(-2/3)) / 1\n*   Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * 3^(2/3)\n*   Ratio = (3²)⁽¹/³⁾ / 2^(1/3)\n*   Ratio = 9^(1/3) / 2^(1/3)\n*   Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)\n*   Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\n**7. Calculation**\n\nLet's compute the final value.\n```python\nimport math\nratio = (4.5)**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_output>\n1.6509640186131448\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation shows that the ratio is approximately 1.65.\n\nThis means that the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\n*   D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's semi-major axis, assuming a circular orbit and random inclination.\n\n**1. Formula for Transit Probability (P_transit):**\nP_transit = R_s / a\nwhere:\n*   R_s is the radius of the host star.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**2. Express Semi-Major Axis (a) in terms of knowns:**\nWe are given the orbital period (P) and the stellar mass (M_s). From Kepler's Third Law, we know the relationship:\nP² ∝ a³ / M_s\nSolving for `a`, we get:\na³ ∝ P² * M_s\na ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3)\n\n**3. Substitute 'a' into the Transit Probability Formula:**\nP_transit ∝ R_s / [(P² * M_s)^(1/3)]\nP_transit ∝ R_s * P^(-2/3) * M_s^(-1/3)\n\n**4. Set up the Ratio:**\nWe want to compare the probability of Planet_1 (P_transit1) to that of Planet_2 (P_transit2). Let's create a ratio:\nRatio = P_transit1 / P_transit2\nRatio = [R_s1 * P1^(-2/3) * M_s1^(-1/3)] / [R_s2 * P2^(-2/3) * M_s2^(-1/3)]\nRatio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (P1 / P2)^(-2/3) * (M_s1 / M_s2)^(-1/3)\nRatio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (P2 / P1)^(2/3) * (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3)\n\n**5. Plug in the given relationships:**\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   Both host stars have the same radii: R_s1 = R_s2  =>  R_s1 / R_s2 = 1\n*   The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: P1 = P2 / 3  =>  P2 / P1 = 3\n*   The mass of Star 1 is twice the mass of Star 2: M_s1 = 2 * M_s2  => M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2\n\n**6. Calculate the Ratio:**\nRatio = (1) * (3)^(2/3) * (1/2)^(1/3)\nRatio = (3²)^(1/3) * (1/2)^(1/3)\nRatio = (9)^(1/3) / (2)^(1/3)\nRatio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)\nRatio = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nUsing the provided calculation, (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.\n\nThis result means that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
