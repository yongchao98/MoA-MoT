    "Here is a detailed reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position C1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position C3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C5.\n\nThe substituents are located at positions 1, 3, and 5. This means each substituent is **meta** to the other two.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding how each substituent directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\nThe final product has a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. This pattern is most easily achieved when the substituents already on the ring are meta-directors, as they will direct the next incoming group to the desired position. The presence of an ortho,para-directing bromine atom in a meta-meta relationship with two other groups suggests a careful ordering of steps is required.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Reaction Sequence Option\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene:** Puts a -NO2 group on the ring (meta-director).\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline:** The -NO2 group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2), which is a strongly activating ortho,para-director.\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a positively charged ammonium complex (-NH3+), which is strongly deactivating and prevents the Friedel-Crafts acylation of the ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect because step (iii) is not feasible as written.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   **i) Benzene → Acetophenone:** Friedel-Crafts acylation puts an acetyl group (-COCH3) on the ring. This group is a meta-director. This is a good starting point.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) to the meta position (C3). The product is 1-acetyl-3-bromobenzene. This aligns with the target structure.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone → Nitration:** Now we nitrate a ring with an acetyl group at C1 (meta-director) and a bromo group at C3 (ortho,para-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   This is a case of competing directors. However, in such 1,3-disubstituted systems, the substitution happens at the position that is least deactivated. Position C5 is meta to both the strong deactivating acetyl group and the weak deactivating bromo group. Experimentally, nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone gives the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product. The directing effect of the acetyl group to position C5 governs the reaction outcome.\n*   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence successfully synthesize the target molecule in high yield. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) are superfluous and would modify the product further, but the initial path is correct.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **i) Benzene → Bromobenzene:** Puts a -Br on the ring (ortho,para-director).\n*   **ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene:** The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group mainly to the para position (C4), yielding 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.\n*   **iii) 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene → Acylation:** Now we have -Br at C1 (o,p-director) and -NO2 at C4 (m-director).\n    *   -Br directs to C2 and C6.\n    *   -NO2 directs to C2 and C6.\n    *   Both groups reinforce substitution at position C2 (or C6). The product would be 2-acetyl-1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (or 1-acetyl-2-bromo-5-nitrobenzene), which is the wrong isomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n*   **i-iv) Benzene → Benzene:** This sequence is i) Nitration, ii) Reduction to aniline, iii) Diazotization, iv) Deamination. The net result of these four steps is the conversion of benzene back into benzene. This sequence is illogical. The subsequent steps (v, vi, vii) form a different isomer, 4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, only Option B outlines a viable synthetic route to 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The first three steps constitute a logical and efficient synthesis. Although the option includes unnecessary additional steps, it is the only choice that contains the correct pathway.\n\nThe correct sequence is:\n1.  **Acylation** of benzene to form acetophenone.\n2.  **Bromination** of acetophenone to form 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Nitration** of 3-bromoacetophenone to form 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis corresponds to the beginning of sequence B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
