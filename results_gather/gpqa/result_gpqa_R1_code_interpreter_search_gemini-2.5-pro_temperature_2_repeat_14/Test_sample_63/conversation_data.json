    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the gaseous products and their quantities from the experimental data.**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of water produced by the decomposition.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases, most notably carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the mass of this tube did not change, no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced. This implies that the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: Hot copper acts as a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, which means the copper was oxidized. This is typically a reaction with O₂ or another oxygen-containing oxidizing gas like N₂O. The mass increase of the copper tube is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have chemically bonded to the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of atomic oxygen is 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas C**: This is the gas that did not get absorbed or react in the previous three tubes. Its volume is given at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nThe total mass of the products must equal the mass of the reactants (7.20 g). Let's calculate the mass of the elements in the gaseous products.\n*   Mass of Hydrogen = Moles(H₂O) * 2 * Molar Mass(H) = 0.20 mol * 2 * 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n*   Mass of Oxygen = Moles(H₂O) * 1 * Molar Mass(O) + Moles(O atoms) * Molar Mass(O) = 0.20 mol * 16.0 g/mol + 0.05 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 3.20 g + 0.80 g = 4.00 g.\n*   The remaining mass must belong to the element(s) that make up Gas C. Total mass = Mass(H) + Mass(O) + Mass(C_element) = 7.20 g.\n*   Mass(C_element) = 7.20 g - 0.4 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n\nGas C is inert to the reagents used. Nitrogen gas (N₂) is the most plausible candidate, especially from heating nitrogen-containing salts. Let's check if this fits.\n*   If Gas C is N₂, its molar mass is 28.0 g/mol.\n*   Mass of 0.10 mol N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\nThis perfectly matches the remaining mass. Therefore, the original salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n**Step 3: Propose the identities of salts A and B.**\n\nSince salts A and B are composed of N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of oxyacids of nitrogen. The most common ones are:\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n\nLet's hypothesize that A and B are these two salts. We are told the mixture is equimolar, meaning moles(A) = moles(B) = n.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the hypothesis with the reaction stoichiometry.**\n\nLet's consider the thermal decomposition reactions for these salts around 200°C.\n*   **NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)**\n*   **NH₄NO₃ (s) → N₂O (g) + 2H₂O (g)**\n\nIn this scenario, the initial gas mixture from decomposing n moles of each salt would be:\n*   H₂O: 2n (from nitrite) + 2n (from nitrate) = 4n mol\n*   N₂: n mol (from nitrite)\n*   N₂O: n mol (from nitrate)\n\nNow, let's trace these gases through the tubes:\n1.  **Tube 1:** Absorbs 4n moles of H₂O.\n2.  **Tube 2:** N₂ and N₂O pass through unreacted.\n3.  **Tube 3:** The oxidizing gas N₂O reacts with hot copper: **N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO**. This reaction consumes n moles of N₂O and adds n moles of oxygen atoms to the copper tube.\n4.  **Final Gas C:** The final gas is the N₂ from the nitrite decomposition (n mol) plus the N₂ from the N₂O reaction (n mol). Total moles of Gas C = n + n = 2n.\n\nNow let's match this stoichiometry with our experimental mole calculations:\n*   Moles of H₂O = 4n = 0.20 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of O atoms = n = 0.05 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of Gas C = 2n = 0.10 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three results consistently give **n = 0.05 mol**. This confirms that the mixture contains 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n**Step 5: Final verification with total mass.**\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol) = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem. The identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**Step 6: Answer the question.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their chemical formulas).\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of atoms in both salts combined is 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>"
