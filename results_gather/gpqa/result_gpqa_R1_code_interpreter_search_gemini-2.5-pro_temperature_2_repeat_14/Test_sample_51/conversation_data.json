    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the populations of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes. This factor is the ratio of `(population ratio without spots)` to `(population ratio with spots)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Law:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere can be assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This means we can use the Boltzmann equation to describe the ratio of the number of atoms in different energy states.\n\n3.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms `n_j` in an excited state `j` to the number of atoms `n_i` in a state `i` is given by:\n    `n_j / n_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))`\n    Where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `E_j` and `E_i` are the energies of the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature of the gas.\n\n4.  **Define the Ratios:** Let's define the population ratio as `Ratio = n2 / n1`, where level 2 is the higher energy level and level 1 is the lower one.\n    *   The ratio without spots is: `Ratio_ns = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns))`\n    *   The ratio with spots is: `Ratio_s = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_s))`\n\n    Here, `T_ns` is the temperature without spots (6000 K), `T_s` is the effective temperature with spots (5500 K), and `ΔE = E2 - E1` is the energy difference between the two levels. The question asks for the \"overall photospheric effective temperature\" when spots are present, which we take as the representative temperature for the Boltzmann equation in that state.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Factor:** The desired factor is `Factor = Ratio_ns / Ratio_s`.\n    `Factor = [(g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns))] / [(g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_s))]`\n    The statistical weight term `(g2 / g1)` cancels out.\n    `Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_s))`\n    Using the properties of exponents (`a^x / a^y = a^(x-y)`), we get:\n    `Factor = exp((-ΔE / k) * (1/T_ns) - (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_s))`\n    `Factor = exp((-ΔE / k) * (1/T_ns - 1/T_s))`\n    `Factor = exp((ΔE / k) * (1/T_s - 1/T_ns))`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy Term (`ΔE/k`):** The problem provides the wavelength of the photon (λ = 1448 Å) corresponding to the transition between the two energy levels. The energy of this photon is equal to the energy difference `ΔE`.\n    `ΔE = h * c / λ`\n    where `h` is the Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n    We need the term `ΔE / k`:\n    `ΔE / k = (h * c) / (λ * k)`\n    This term has units of temperature (Kelvin) and represents the energy difference in temperature units.\n\n7.  **Perform the Calculation:** We will use a python script to compute the values precisely.\n\n    *   **Inputs:**\n        *   T_ns = 6000 K\n        *   T_s = 5500 K\n        *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   **Constants:**\n        *   `h` (Planck constant) = 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   `c` (speed of light) = 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s\n        *   `k` (Boltzmann constant) = 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   **Calculation steps:**\n        1.  Calculate `ΔE / k`.\n        2.  Plug `ΔE / k`, `T_ns`, and `T_s` into the `Factor` formula.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\nc = 2.99792458e8     # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given values from the problem\nT_ns = 6000.0  # Temperature of the star's surface without spots (K)\nT_s = 5500.0   # Overall effective temperature of the star with spots (K)\nlambda_angstrom = 1448.0  # Wavelength of the transition in Angstroms\nlambda_m = lambda_angstrom * 1e-10  # Convert wavelength to meters\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the energy difference term, delta_E / k\ndelta_E_over_k = (h * c) / (lambda_m * k)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the factor by which the ratio changes\n# Factor = Ratio_no_spots / Ratio_spots\n# Factor = exp((delta_E / k) * (1/T_s - 1/T_ns))\nfactor = np.exp(delta_E_over_k * (1/T_s - 1/T_ns))\n\nprint(f\"The factor by which the ratio changes is: {factor:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe factor by which the ratio changes is: 4.51\n>>>The final computed value for the factor is approximately 4.51. This matches option D.\n\nThe additional information about the star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage allows for a deeper analysis (e.g., calculating the temperature of the spots themselves), but for the question asked, a direct comparison using the provided effective temperatures is the most straightforward approach and leads to one of the given answers. This implies that we should use the overall effective temperatures as the characteristic temperatures for the LTE calculation in each case.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The factor by which the ratio changes is given by the ratio of the Boltzmann factors at the two different temperatures.\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (n₂/n₁) is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n(n₂/n₁) = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT)\nwhere:\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature.\n\nLet T_ns be the temperature without spots (6000 K) and T_s be the temperature with spots (5500 K).\nThe ratio without spots is: Ratio_ns = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns))\nThe ratio with spots is: Ratio_s = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_s))\n\nWe want to find the factor by which the ratio changes, which is `Factor = Ratio_ns / Ratio_s`.\n\nFactor = [(g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns))] / [(g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_s))]\nThe statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out.\nFactor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_s))\nUsing the property of exponents, exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a-b):\nFactor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns) - (-ΔE / (k * T_s)))\nFactor = exp( (ΔE/k) * (1/T_s - 1/T_ns) )\n\nNext, we need to calculate the energy difference, ΔE. It corresponds to the energy of a photon with wavelength λ = 1448 Å.\nΔE = hc/λ\nwhere h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\nSo, the term ΔE/k can be calculated as:\nΔE/k = hc / (λk)\n\nLet's plug in the values and compute the result using the provided code output.\n*   T_ns = 6000 K\n*   T_s = 5500 K\n*   λ = 1448 Å = 1.448 × 10⁻⁷ m\n*   h = 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c = 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   k = 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n\nFrom the code execution:\n1.  The term `delta_E_over_k` = (hc) / (λk) is calculated.\n2.  This value is used in the `factor` formula: `factor = exp(delta_E_over_k * (1/5500 - 1/6000))`.\n\nThe code output shows the result of this calculation: `The factor by which the ratio changes is: 4.51`.\nThis value is approximately 4.5, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
