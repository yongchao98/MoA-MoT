    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reagents for the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** butan-2-one. This is a ketone.\n        ```\n          O\n          ||\n       CH3-C-CH2-CH3\n        ```\n    *   **Reactant 2:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN). This provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which is a strong nucleophile.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This compound is a cyanohydrin. The structure shows that a -CN group and an -OH group have been added to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        ```\n           OH\n           |\n        CH3-C-C≡N\n           |\n           CH2CH3\n        ```\n\n2.  **Analyze the Transformation:**\n    This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation** reaction. The reaction proceeds in two main steps:\n    *   **Step 1 (Nucleophilic Addition):** The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond and forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        ```\n           O⁻\n           |\n        CH3-C-C≡N\n           |\n           CH2CH3\n        ```\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** The negatively charged oxygen (the alkoxide) is then protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group. This requires a proton source.\n\n3.  **Determine the role of Reagent 'A':**\n    *   Reagent 'A' must provide the proton (H⁺) needed for Step 2.\n    *   Let's evaluate the options provided for 'A':\n        *   **NaHSO₃ (Sodium bisulfite):** This reagent reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products, which is a different reaction pathway. It is not used as a proton source in cyanohydrin formation.\n        *   **H₃O⁺ (Hydronium ion):** This represents an acidic workup (e.g., adding a dilute mineral acid like HCl after the initial reaction). Adding an acid is the standard way to protonate the alkoxide intermediate and obtain the final cyanohydrin product.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. This is an α-hydroxynitrile. The key functional group we are concerned with is the nitrile group (-C≡N).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is an α-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The key functional group is the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Transformation:**\n    *   The reaction converts a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the presence of water. This is a **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n        ```\n        R-C≡N + 2 H₂O  --[catalyst]--> R-COOH + NH₃\n        ```\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires either strong acidic or strong basic conditions and typically heat.\n\n3.  **Determine the role of Reagent 'B':**\n    *   Reagent 'B' acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   Let's evaluate the options provided for 'B':\n        *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong mineral acid. Heating a nitrile with aqueous strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) is a standard laboratory method for hydrolyzing it to a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions. The reaction would be extremely slow or might stop at the intermediate amide stage.\n    *   Therefore, the suitable reagent for this complete hydrolysis is the strong acid, **B = HCl**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   For the first reaction, reagent **A** must be **H₃O⁺** for the acid workup step.\n*   For the second reaction, reagent **B** must be **HCl** to catalyze the nitrile hydrolysis.\n\nCombining these findings, we match them to the given options:\n*   A) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  (Incorrect)\n*   B) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl      (Incorrect)\n*   C) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl      (**Correct**)\n*   D) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH   (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
