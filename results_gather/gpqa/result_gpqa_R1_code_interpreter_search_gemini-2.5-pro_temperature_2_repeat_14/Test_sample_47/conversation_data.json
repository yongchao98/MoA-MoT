    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2).**\nThis is a classic alpha-halogenation reaction of a ketone. The bromine atom will substitute one of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so both α-positions are equivalent. The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Product 1: 2-bromocyclohexanone**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).**\nWhen an α-haloketone with available α'-protons (protons on the other α-carbon) is treated with a strong base, the most characteristic reaction is the **Favorskii rearrangement**. The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α'-proton (from C6) to form an enolate. This enolate then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate, leading to ring-opening. This process results in a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring is converted into a five-membered cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group (after neutralization).\nAn alternative reaction is E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the subsequent reaction with thionyl chloride strongly suggests the formation of a carboxylic acid, making the Favorskii rearrangement the intended pathway.\n*   **Product 2: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid** (or its sodium salt, sodium cyclopentanecarboxylate, which for the next step behaves similarly or is assumed to be worked up to the acid).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.**\nThionyl chloride is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acid chlorides. Pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   **Product 3: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OᵗBu)₃).**\nThis is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without over-reduction to the corresponding primary alcohol. It selectively delivers one hydride ion to the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Product 4: Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**\n\n**Final Question: How many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4?**\n\nTo answer this, we need to analyze the structure and symmetry of Product 4, **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**.\n\n1.  **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). Let's number the carbon atoms of the ring from C1 to C5, with the aldehyde group attached to C1.\n\n2.  **Symmetry:** On average (due to rapid ring-flipping), the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (a Cₛ plane). This plane passes through the aldehyde group (C-H and C=O), the C1 carbon atom, the hydrogen atom attached to C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Hydrogen Atoms:** We use this symmetry to determine which hydrogens are chemically equivalent (and would give a single signal in an ¹H NMR spectrum).\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton:** The hydrogen in the -CHO group. It lies on the plane of symmetry. It is unique. **(1st type)**\n    *   **C1 Proton:** The hydrogen attached to C1 of the ring. It also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. **(2nd type)**\n    *   **C2 and C5 Protons:** The plane of symmetry reflects C2 onto C5, making these positions equivalent. Each position is a CH₂ group. We must determine if the two hydrogens on a single carbon (e.g., C2) are equivalent. They are not related by any symmetry element of the molecule. Replacing each in turn with a test group 'X' would create a pair of diastereomers (cis and trans isomers with respect to the aldehyde group). Therefore, the two hydrogens on C2 are **diastereotopic** and are not chemically equivalent.\n        *   The two \"cis\" protons (on C2 and C5, relative to the CHO group) are equivalent to each other by symmetry. **(3rd type)**\n        *   The two \"trans\" protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other by symmetry. **(4th type)**\n    *   **C3 and C4 Protons:** The plane of symmetry also reflects C3 onto C4, making these positions equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two geminal hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent.\n        *   The two \"cis\" protons (on C3 and C4) are equivalent to each other. **(5th type)**\n        *   The two \"trans\" protons (on C3 and C4) are equivalent to each other. **(6th type)**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are 6 sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\nThe 6 types are:\n1.  The aldehyde H (1 proton)\n2.  The H on C1 (1 proton)\n3.  The 2 equivalent H's on C2 and C5 (\"cis\")\n4.  The 2 equivalent H's on C2 and C5 (\"trans\")\n5.  The 2 equivalent H's on C3 and C4 (\"cis\")\n6.  The 2 equivalent H's on C3 and C4 (\"trans\")\n\nTherefore, there are **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
