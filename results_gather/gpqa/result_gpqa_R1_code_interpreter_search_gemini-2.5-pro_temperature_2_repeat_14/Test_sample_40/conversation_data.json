    "Here's a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference**\n\n*   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's stationary frame of reference.\n*   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference moving with the glass. It moves at a velocity *v* relative to the laboratory frame.\n\n**2. Determine the Velocities in Each Frame**\n\n*   **v:** The velocity of the glass frame (S') relative to the laboratory frame (S). The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n*   **u':** The speed of the light beam as measured *within* the glass frame (S'). In its own rest frame, the speed of light in the glass is determined by its index of refraction, *n*, and the speed of light in vacuum, *c*. The formula is `u' = c/n`. Since the problem specifies `c = 1`, the speed of light in the glass, relative to the glass itself, is `u' = 1/n`.\n*   **u:** The speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). This is the value we need to find.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n\nWhen velocities are in the same direction, we cannot simply add them (`u = u' + v`) because of the principles of special relativity. We must use the Einstein velocity addition formula:\n\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n**4. Substitute the Known Values**\n\nNow, we substitute the values from step 2 into this formula:\n\n*   `u' = 1/n`\n*   `v = v`\n*   `c = 1`\n\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n**5. Simplify the Expression**\n\nLet's clean up the equation:\n\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\nTo remove the fractions within the numerator and the denominator, we can multiply both the top and bottom of the main fraction by *n*:\n\n`u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\nDistribute the *n* in both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n`u = (n*(1/n) + n*v) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\nThis result, `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
