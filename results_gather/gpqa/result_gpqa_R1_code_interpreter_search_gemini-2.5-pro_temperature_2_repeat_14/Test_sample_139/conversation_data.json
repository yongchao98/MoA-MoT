    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This points to common elements with stable heavy isotopes used in chemistry, like Deuterium (D or ²H), ¹³C, ¹⁵N, ¹⁸O, etc.\n    *   **Clue 2 & 7: \"substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" and \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"** This strongly suggests X is a reducing agent. Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent. It reduces both ketones (R-CO-R') and carboxylic acids (R-COOH). A keto acid (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH, which has 3 oxygens) would be reduced by LiAlH₄ to a diol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH, which has 2 oxygens). This perfectly matches the description. The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄, and Substance X, which incorporates the heavy isotope, must be its deuterated version, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Verify with Other Clues using X = LiAlD₄:**\n    *   **Clue 3 & 4: \"reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms\".**\n        *   LiAlD₄ reacts extremely violently with water (let's assume Y = H₂O).\n        *   The primary reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O -> LiOH (soluble) + Al(OH)₃ (s) + 4 HD (g)`\n        *   The precipitate **G is Aluminium Hydroxide, Al(OH)₃**.\n        *   The gas produced is mainly HD (Deuterium Hydride), which has 2 protons and 1 neutron. This does not fit the description of gas W (equal protons and neutrons).\n        *   However, the reaction is extremely violent and exothermic. This provides enough energy to cause a side reaction: the thermal decomposition of LiAlD₄ itself. `LiAlD₄ --(heat)--> LiD + Al + 3/2 D₂`.\n        *   The gas **D₂ (Deuterium gas) is our gas W**. A molecule of D₂ contains two Deuterium atoms. Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**, satisfying the condition.\n    *   **Clue 5 & 6: \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        *   We identified G as Al(OH)₃. When heated, hydroxides decompose. `2 Al(OH)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 H₂O`.\n        *   The substance released, **B, is water (H₂O)**.\n        *   The melting point of water is 273.15 K (0°C). 277 K is 4°C. This is described as \"very close\", which is a reasonable approximation in a chemistry puzzle.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   We need to find the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present\". We will use mass numbers for this calculation (protons + neutrons).\n        *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (present as D, ²H). Mass number = 2.\n        *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminium (present as ²⁷Al). Mass number = 27.\n        *   **Intermediate element:** Lithium (present as ⁷Li). Mass number = 7.\n    *   The instruction says: \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we must account for the stoichiometry in the formula LiAlD₄.\n    *   Total mass contribution of the lightest element (Deuterium) = (Number of D atoms) × (Mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Total mass contribution of the heaviest element (Aluminium) = (Number of Al atoms) × (Mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (summed) mass = (Total mass of D) + (Total mass of Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nLet's double check with a simple python script.\n```python\n# Atomic mass numbers for the isotopes in LiAlD4\n# D (Deuterium, 2H) has mass number 2\n# Al (Aluminum, 27Al) has mass number 27\n\n# Number of atoms in the formula LiAlD4\nnum_D_atoms = 4\nnum_Al_atoms = 1\n\n# Mass contributions\nmass_D_total = num_D_atoms * 2\nmass_Al_total = num_Al_atoms * 27\n\n# Cumulative mass of the lightest (D) and heaviest (Al) elements\ncumulative_mass = mass_D_total + mass_Al_total\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "The final answer is $\\boxed{35}$.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify Substance X**:\n    *   The problem states that \"substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" and that its reaction with a keto acid results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acids (R-CO-COOH) have 3 oxygen atoms. A reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups would lead to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which has 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   This points to a powerful reducing agent. A common one is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄.\n    *   Since Substance X \"incorporates a heavier isotope\", it is likely the deuterated version, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Verify with Other Clues**:\n    *   **Reaction with Liquid Y**: LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water (Y = H₂O).\n    *   **Gas W**: The reaction produces gas. One possible reaction is the thermal decomposition of X due to the heat generated: `LiAlD₄ → LiD + Al + 3/2 D₂`. The gas produced is Deuterium gas (**W = D₂**). A D₂ molecule contains two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has a total of **2 protons and 2 neutrons**, matching the description.\n    *   **Precipitate G**: The main reaction with water is `LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O → LiOH + Al(OH)₃(s) + 4HD(g)`. The precipitate **G is Aluminium Hydroxide (Al(OH)₃)**.\n    *   **Substance B**: When precipitate G (Al(OH)₃) is heated, it decomposes: `2 Al(OH)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 H₂O`. The substance released is water (**B = H₂O**). The melting point of water is 273.15 K, which is \"very close to 277 K\" as stated.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Cumulative Mass**:\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D). Its mass number is 2.\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (Al). Its mass number is 27.\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing all instances.\n    *   In one molecule of LiAlD₄:\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 atoms, so 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is 1 atom, so 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative sum is 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
