    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure and symmetry of Product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Process:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho, para-directing and activating group. This means the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) will predominantly add to the positions ortho (2 and 6) and para (4) to the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** Due to less steric hindrance, the major product is para-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene). We will follow the reaction path of this major isomer.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: A benzene ring with a -CH₃ group at position 1 and an -NO₂ group at position 4.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (4-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Process:** This mixture is a strong oxidizing agent. It oxidizes the alkyl side chain of the benzene ring to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), provided there is a benzylic hydrogen (which the -CH₃ group has). The nitro group is stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** The -CH₃ group of 4-nitrotoluene is oxidized to a -COOH group. The product is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.\n    *   Structure of Product 2: A benzene ring with a -COOH group at position 1 and an -NO₂ group at position 4.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (4-nitrobenzoic acid) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.\n*   **Process Analysis:** There are two main plausible reaction pathways.\n    1.  **Janovsky Reaction (Meisenheimer Complex Formation):** In the presence of a strong base (NaOH), acetone forms an enolate anion (⁻CH₂COCH₃). This nucleophilic enolate can attack the electron-deficient aromatic ring of 4-nitrobenzoic acid (which exists as the 4-nitrobenzoate anion in the basic solution). The attack would occur at a position activated by the electron-withdrawing nitro group (ortho to -NO₂), forming a σ-complex known as a Meisenheimer complex. This complex would have an sp³-hybridized carbon in the ring where the acetonyl group has attached, making it a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is asymmetric and belongs to the **C₁ point group**. However, C₁ is not among the given options (A, B, C, D), suggesting this is not the intended reaction pathway.\n    2.  **Reductive Coupling:** Nitroarenes can undergo reductive coupling in basic media, especially in the presence of a reducing agent. Acetone can act as a reducing agent in this context, becoming oxidized itself while it reduces the nitro group. This reaction typically couples two molecules of the nitroarene to form an azo (-N=N-) or azoxy (-N(O)=N-) compound. The formation of the more stable *trans*-azo compound is a known reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Following the reductive coupling pathway, two molecules of 4-nitrobenzoate are coupled to form trans-4,4'-azobis(benzoic acid). In the aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, this product exists as its dianion salt, **trans-4,4'-azobis(benzoate)**.\n    *   Structure of Product 3: OOC⁻-C₆H₄-N=N-C₆H₄-COO⁻, with the two benzoate groups in a *trans* configuration about the central -N=N- double bond.\n\n**Symmetry Analysis of Product 3**\n*   **Molecule:** trans-4,4'-azobis(benzoate).\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** Let's analyze the symmetry of the idealized planar structure of this molecule.\n    *   **C₂ axis:** There is a twofold rotational axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and passing through the center of the N=N bond. Rotating the molecule by 180° around this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the N=N bond. Any point (x, y, z) on the molecule is mapped to an identical point at (-x, -y, -z).\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σh):** There is a horizontal mirror plane that is coincident with the plane of the molecule itself. It is perpendicular to the principal C₂ axis.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that contains an identity element (E), a C₂ axis, a center of inversion (i), and a horizontal plane of symmetry (σh) belongs to the **C₂h point group**.\n\nThis analysis provides a product whose symmetry group is one of the given options.\n\nFinal Answer reasoning steps:\n1.  Reaction sequence leads to p-nitrobenzoic acid.\n2.  The reaction of p-nitrobenzoic acid with acetone and base to produce one of the options for the point group suggests a reductive coupling.\n3.  The product is trans-4,4'-azobis(benzoate).\n4.  The point group for trans-4,4'-azobis(benzoate) is C₂h.\n\n<<<A>>>"
