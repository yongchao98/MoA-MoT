    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   All four potential compounds are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group is present but does not help differentiate between the options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   The information that there are no vinyl-hydrogens confirms the absence of C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all options.\n    *   The crucial information lies in the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of two specific signals:\n        *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n        *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structural Requirements for Each Splitting Pattern:**\n    *   For a **dtq**, a proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet, d).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (e.g., a CH₂ group, giving a triplet, t).\n        *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (e.g., a CH₃ group, giving a quartet, q).\n        This implies a structural fragment like `CH₃-CH₂-CH*-CH-`, where `H*` is the proton being observed.\n    *   For a **dtt**, a proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet, d).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (e.g., a CH₂ group, giving a triplet, t).\n        *   *Another* different group of two equivalent neighboring protons (e.g., a second CH₂ group, giving another triplet, t).\n        This implies a structural fragment like `-CH₂-CH*-CH₂-CH-`, where `H*` is the proton being observed.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n\n    *   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n        This molecule has only one CH₂ group. It is structurally impossible for any proton to be coupled to two different CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (Interpreted as 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n        `CH₃-CH₂(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is not correct. Correct interpretation: `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`, which leads to the IUPAC name 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid (as it is an isomer of C9H18O2). If interpreted as 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, (`CH3-CH2-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`, a C10 compound) it has two different protons (on C3 and C4) which could both give `dtt` signals, but no proton that would give a clear `dtq` signal from first-order analysis.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\n        The proton on C3 is coupled to the C2 proton (1H, doublet), the C4 methylene protons (2H, triplet), and the C3-methyl protons (3H, quartet). This perfectly matches the requirement for a **dtq**. However, the molecule contains only one CH₂ group, so it is impossible for it to produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-COOH`\n        Let's analyze the proton on C3 (the third carbon from the COOH group):\n        `CH₃CH₂–CH(Et)–CH(Et)–COOH`\n                       ^\n                     (H on C3)\n        This C3 proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton on C2 (1H) → doublet (d).\n        *   The methylene (CH₂) protons on C4 (2H) → triplet (t).\n        *   The methylene (CH₂) protons of its own ethyl group substituent (2H) → triplet (t).\n        This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This molecule perfectly explains one of the required signals.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Molecule C can explain the `dtq` but not the `dtt`. Molecule D can explain the `dtt` but explaining the `dtq` is not straightforward from a simple first-order analysis (it would likely arise from the accidental simplification of a more complex multiplet like a `ddq` from a diastereotopic methylene group, which is common in complex molecules).\n    However, it is structurally *impossible* for molecule C to produce a `dtt` because it lacks the required number of neighboring CH₂ groups. In contrast, molecule D is a complex structure that contains all the necessary pieces (CH, CH₂, CH₃ groups) and perfectly explains the highly specific `dtt` pattern. Therefore, it is the only plausible structure among the choices that could exhibit both phenomena, even if one requires a more advanced NMR interpretation. Given the options, Molecule D is the best fit.\n\nThe compound is **CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
