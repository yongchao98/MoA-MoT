    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Given Information\n\nThe problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵\".\nLet's denote the number of stars as `N` and the parallax as `plx`. The relationship can be written as a proportionality:\nN ∝ 1 / plx⁵ or N ∝ plx⁻⁵\n\nIn astrophysics, when discussing star counts as a function of a limiting parameter (like magnitude, distance, or parallax), \"the number of stars\" typically refers to the **cumulative count** of all stars satisfying the condition. In this case, it means the number of stars with a parallax *greater than* a certain value `plx` (which corresponds to stars *closer than* a certain distance `r`).\n\n### 2. Relating Parallax to Distance\n\nParallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely related. The standard formula is:\nr = 1 / plx\n(where `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\nFrom this relationship, we can express parallax in terms of distance:\nplx = 1 / r\n\n### 3. Expressing the Number of Stars in Terms of Distance\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for parallax (`plx = 1/r`) into the given relationship for the number of stars:\nN ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵\nN ∝ 1 / (1/r⁵)\nN ∝ r⁵\n\nThis tells us that the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance. We can write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\nN(r) = k * r⁵\n\n### 4. Determining the Quantity to be Found\n\nThe question asks for \"how the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is asking for the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance. Mathematically, this is the derivative of the number of stars `N` with respect to the distance `r`, which is `dN/dr`.\n\nThis quantity, `dN/dr`, represents the number of stars within a thin spherical shell at distance `r` with a unit thickness.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Derivative\n\nWe need to differentiate our expression for `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\nN(r) = k * r⁵\n\nUsing the power rule of differentiation (d/dx(axⁿ) = anxⁿ⁻¹):\ndN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)\ndN/dr = k * 5 * r⁵⁻¹\ndN/dr = (5k) * r⁴\n\n### 6. Final Conclusion\n\nThe result `dN/dr = (5k) * r⁴` shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`, since `5k` is a constant.\n\ndN/dr ∝ r⁴\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ r³\nB) ~ r⁵\nC) ~ r⁴\nD) ~ r²\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
