    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct statement:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Chemical Problem:** The goal is to synthesize a branched polymer using only ethylene as the raw material. This requires a tandem (\"dual\") catalyst system operating in a single reactor.\n    *   **Catalyst 1 (Polymerization):** Takes ethylene and polymerizes it to form the main polyethylene chain. This is a standard polymerization catalyst (e.g., a metallocene or Ziegler-Natta type). The initial result, as stated, is a high-density (linear) polymer.\n    *   **Catalyst 2 (Oligomerization):** This is the key component for branching. It must take ethylene and convert it into a short-chain alpha-olefin (e.g., 1-butene, 1-hexene, or 1-octene).\n    *   **Tandem Action:** Catalyst 1 then incorporates this newly formed alpha-olefin as a comonomer into the growing polyethylene chain, creating a branch.\n    *   **\"Regular Branches\":** This is a critical detail. To get regular branches (i.e., branches of a consistent length), the oligomerization reaction must be highly selective. For instance, it should produce primarily 1-hexene (leading to C4 branches) and not a broad mixture of different olefins.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Statement based on Chemical Principles:**\n\n    *   **A) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\n        *   Noble metals like nickel (Ni) are used industrially for ethylene oligomerization in the Shell Higher Olefin Process (SHOP). However, the SHOP process produces a broad, statistical distribution of alpha-olefins, which would result in *irregular* branches, not regular ones. While some highly selective palladium (Pd) catalysts for ethylene dimerization to 1-butene exist, the most prominent technology for making regularly branched polyethylene relies on other metals. Because the most common noble metal systems lead to irregular branches, this statement is misleading and likely incorrect in the specific context of forming *regular* branches.\n\n    *   **B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\n        *   The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the selective oligomerization of ethylene. The most successful and widely studied catalysts for selective ethylene trimerization (to 1-hexene) are based on chromium. These chromium catalysts are almost always activated by an aluminum-based cocatalyst, most commonly methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO). Since these aluminum-based activators are, in fact, essential for the reaction, this statement is definitively **incorrect**.\n\n    *   **C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n        *   Group VIa (or Group 6) on the periodic table includes Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W). As mentioned above, chromium-based catalysts (e.g., systems containing Cr(acac)₃, specific ligands like PNP or SNS, and an MAO activator) are renowned for their exceptionally high selectivity and activity in converting ethylene into 1-hexene. This 1-hexene is the perfect in-situ comonomer to create regular butyl (C4) branches. This statement accurately describes the cornerstone of modern tandem catalysis for this purpose. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **D) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\n        *   This technology has indeed been commercialized. Univation Technologies, a joint venture between The Dow Chemical Company and ExxonMobil Chemical Company (both US companies), has developed and licensed this technology on a large, industrial scale (e.g., their XCAT™ Metallocene Catalysts platform). The technology is used in plants in the US and globally. Therefore, this statement is also factually **correct**.\n\n3.  **Select the Best Answer:**\n    *   We have established that statement B is definitively incorrect and statement A is incorrect in the context of regular branching.\n    *   Both statements C and D are factually correct. However, the question originates from a scientist in a research lab seeking to develop a system. Statement C provides direct chemical insight into the *type* of catalyst to use (\"use a Group VIa metal\"), which is fundamental scientific information. Statement D provides the commercial context. In scientific problem-solving, the statement describing the underlying chemical principle (C) is generally considered the more fundamental and relevant answer compared to the one describing its commercial status (D). The breakthrough was the discovery of the Group VIa catalyst system; its industrialization followed.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
