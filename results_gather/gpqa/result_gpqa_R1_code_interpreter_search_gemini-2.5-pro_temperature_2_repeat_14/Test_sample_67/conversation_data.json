    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle.\n    *   The initial magnetic field is in the +Z direction: `B_initial = B * z_hat`.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is `mu = gamma * S`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator and `gamma` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in the energy eigenstate where the spin is parallel to the field. The Hamiltonian for the initial situation is `H_initial = -mu . B_initial = -gamma * B * S_z`. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`). To be aligned with the +Z field, the spin must be in the `|+z>` state, which is the lower energy state.\n    *   Therefore, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian for Time Evolution:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off, and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the +Y direction: `B_new = B * y_hat`.\n    *   For `t > 0`, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian, `H_new`.\n    *   `H_new = -mu . B_new = -gamma * S . (B * y_hat) = -gamma * B * S_y`.\n    *   `S_y` is the y-component of the spin operator.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting `H_new`, we get: `U(t) = exp(-i * (-gamma * B * S_y) * t / ħ) = exp(i * gamma * B * t * S_y / ħ)`.\n    *   So, `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * gamma * B * t * S_y / ħ) |+z>`.\n    *   For a spin-1/2 particle, `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix.\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * gamma * B * t * (ħ/2) * σ_y / ħ) |+z> = exp(i * (gamma * B * t / 2) * σ_y) |+z>`.\n    *   Let `α = gamma * B * t / 2`. The expression simplifies to `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * α * σ_y) |+z>`.\n    *   We use the identity `exp(i * α * σ_y) = I * cos(α) + i * σ_y * sin(α)`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n    *   So, `|ψ(t)> = (I * cos(α) + i * σ_y * sin(α)) |+z>`.\n    *   In the standard Z-basis, `|+z> = [[1], [0]]` and `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   `σ_y |+z> = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [[1], [0]] = [[0], [i]] = i * [[0], [1]] = i * |-z>`.\n    *   Substituting this back: `|ψ(t)> = cos(α)|+z> + i * (i * |-z>) * sin(α) = cos(α)|+z> - sin(α)|-z>`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-component of the Moment:**\n    *   We need to find the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`, which is `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = gamma * S_z`, this is `<μ_z(t)> = gamma * <S_z(t)>`, where `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   First, let's operate with `S_z` on `|ψ(t)>`:\n        `S_z |ψ(t)> = S_z * (cos(α)|+z> - sin(α)|-z>)`\n        `S_z |ψ(t)> = cos(α) * S_z |+z> - sin(α) * S_z |-z>`\n        Using `S_z |±z> = ±(ħ/2)|±z>`, we get:\n        `S_z |ψ(t)> = cos(α) * (ħ/2)|+z> - sin(α) * (-ħ/2)|-z> = (ħ/2) * (cos(α)|+z> + sin(α)|-z>)`.\n    *   Now, we compute the inner product `<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`:\n        `<ψ(t)| = cos(α)<+z| - sin(α)<-z|`.\n        `<S_z(t)> = (cos(α)<+z| - sin(α)<-z|) * (ħ/2) * (cos(α)|+z> + sin(α)|-z>)`.\n        Using the orthogonality relations (`<+z|+z> = 1`, `<+z|-z> = 0`, etc.), this simplifies to:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos(α) * cos(α) - sin(α) * sin(α)) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(α) - sin²(α))`.\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2α) = cos²(α) - sin²(α)`, we have:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(2α)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   Now substitute back `α = gamma * B * t / 2`.\n    *   `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * [gamma * B * t / 2]) = (ħ/2) * cos(gamma * B * t)`.\n    *   The expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = gamma * <S_z(t)> = gamma * (ħ/2) * cos(gamma * B * t)`.\n    *   This expression describes an oscillation of the form `A * cos(ωt)`. The angular frequency of oscillation `ω` is the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function.\n    *   By comparison, the angular frequency `ω = gamma * B`.\n    *   This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `gamma * B`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
