    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of each reactant.**\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of moles of the acidic and basic species in each solution. The formula for moles is Molarity (M) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, so moles of H+ = 0.080 mol.\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with the acids. The reaction with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) happens completely first, followed by the reaction with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Base + Strong Acid**\n    *   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H⁺ ions are the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol**\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base + Weak Acid**\n    *   CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available from Reaction 1 = 0.100 mol\n    *   The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**3. Determine the final composition and calculate pH.**\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of strong base (OH⁻). The pH of the solution will be determined by the concentration of these excess hydroxide ions. The conjugate base formed (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base, but its contribution to the hydroxide concentration is negligible compared to the excess strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻ ions:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH and then the pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167)\n    *   To calculate this value, we can use a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of excess OH-\nmoles_oh_excess = 0.050\n\n# Total volume in L\ntotal_volume = 1.200\n\n# Concentration of excess OH-\nconc_oh_excess = moles_oh_excess / total_volume\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_oh_excess)\n\n# Calculate pH\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH=}\")\n```\n>>>\npH=12.619788775463724\n<<<\nThe calculation shows that the pH is approximately 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a chemical reaction problem involving acids and bases. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH)**: This is a weak acid.\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (L)\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol CH₃COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)**: This is a strong acid, which means it completely dissociates into H⁺ and Cl⁻.\n    *   Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol HCl**\n    *   Therefore, we have **0.080 mol of H⁺** ions.\n\n*   **Moles of Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂)**: This is a strong base, which means it completely dissociates into Ba²⁺ and 2 OH⁻.\n    *   Moles = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = **0.090 mol Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   Since each molecule of Ba(OH)₂ produces two hydroxide ions, the moles of OH⁻ are:\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol OH⁻**\n\n**2. Determine the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with the acids. It will neutralize the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) first, followed by the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Step 1: Reaction between strong acid and strong base.**\n    *   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   We have 0.080 mol of H⁺ and 0.180 mol of OH⁻. The H⁺ is the limiting reactant.\n    *   All 0.080 mol of H⁺ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol OH⁻**\n\n*   **Step 2: Reaction between the remaining strong base and the weak acid.**\n    *   Reaction: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   We have 0.050 mol of CH₃COOH and 0.100 mol of OH⁻ remaining. The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant.\n    *   All 0.050 mol of CH₃COOH will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol OH⁻**\n\n**3. Calculate the pH of the final solution.**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH⁻). The presence of the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) is negligible in determining the pH compared to the strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the final solution.**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of the excess OH⁻.**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH and then the pH.**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is: pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe Python code execution confirms this calculation: `pH = 12.6197...`, which rounds to 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
