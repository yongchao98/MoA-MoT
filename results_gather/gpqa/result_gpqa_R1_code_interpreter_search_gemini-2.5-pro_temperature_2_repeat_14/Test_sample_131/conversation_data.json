    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Information Provided**\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n2.  **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum of the Mixture:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlet signals with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlet signals with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. All signals are around 2.2 ppm, characteristic of methyl groups attached to an aromatic ring.\n4.  **The Candidates:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n### **Step 2: Check Molecular Formulas and Rule out Candidates Based on Signal Type**\n*   **Molecular Formula Check:** All four compounds, the three tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4) and 1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2), have the molecular formula C10H14. This does not eliminate any options.\n*   **Signal Type Check:** The problem states that all signals in the aliphatic region are **singlets**.\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene has two ethyl groups. The protons of the ethyl groups (-CH2- and -CH3) would couple with each other, producing a **quartet** and a **triplet**, not singlets.\n    *   Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds in the mixture. This eliminates **Option A**.\n\n### **Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Remaining Isomer**\nWe need to determine the number of signals and their relative integrations for the three tetramethylbenzene isomers based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary (Durene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Since they are equivalent, they appear as a single signal. Although they are adjacent, in such an A2 spin system, they produce a **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. They give one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. They give a second, different signal (6H).\n        *   This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**. The ratio is 6:6 or 1:1.\n    *   **Summary (Prehnitene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. They will appear as **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Isodurene):** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\nNow we combine the spectra of the pairs in the remaining options (B, C, D) and see which one matches the experimental data for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**Experimental Data Requirements:**\n*   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   Since the mixture is 1:1, the total number of methyl protons is 12 (from one molecule) + 12 (from the other) = 24H.\n    *   The ratio 2:1:1 has a total of 4 parts. So the signals must correspond to integrations of:\n        *   (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   We are looking for a pair of compounds whose combined methyl signals are: one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets.\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons is 2 (from one molecule) + 2 (from the other) = 4H.\n    *   A 1:1 ratio means the two signals must each integrate to **2H**.\n\n**Let's test the options:**\n\n*   **B) Durene + Isodurene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: {12H} from Durene + {6H, 3H, 3H} from Isodurene = A total of 4 signals. **Does not match.**\n\n*   **C) Prehnitene + Isodurene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: {6H, 6H} from Prehnitene + {6H, 3H, 3H} from Isodurene. The combination does not produce the required {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern. **Does not match.**\n\n*   **D) Durene + Prehnitene**\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet of **12H**.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes two separate singlets of **6H** each.\n        *   The total is three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet of **2H**.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes one singlet of **2H**.\n        *   These two signals are from non-identical molecules, so they will likely have slightly different chemical shifts, resulting in two separate signals. Each signal integrates to 2H. The ratio is 2:2, which simplifies to **1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) is the only one that perfectly reproduces all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
