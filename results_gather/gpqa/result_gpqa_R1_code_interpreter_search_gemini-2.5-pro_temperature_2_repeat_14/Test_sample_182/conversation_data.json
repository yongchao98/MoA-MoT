    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its structure and its index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD). The IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is a count of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n    *   **Structure breakdown:**\n        *   `cyclohex-3-ene`: This is a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond. This accounts for **one ring** and **one pi bond**.\n        *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): This group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This accounts for **one pi bond**.\n        *   `formyl` (-CHO): This is an aldehyde group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This accounts for **one pi bond**.\n        *   `vinyl` (-CH=CH2): This group contains one carbon-carbon double bond. This accounts for **one pi bond**.\n\n    *   **Calculate the IHD of the reactant:**\n        Summing up the contributions:\n        IHD(reactant) = 1 (from the ring) + 1 (from C=C in ring) + 1 (from C=O in acid) + 1 (from C=O in formyl) + 1 (from C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reactant is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydriodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful and well-known reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n\n    *   **Effect of Red P + HI:** This reagent combination is capable of the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n        *   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) and aldehydes (-CHO) completely to alkyl groups (-CH3). This involves the reduction of the C=O bonds.\n        *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n        *   It does not, under typical conditions, break open a stable cycloalkane ring.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    The reaction will reduce all the unsaturations (pi bonds) in the starting material but will leave the carbon ring intact.\n\n    *   The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C bond, making it a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The C=C bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid is reduced, and the entire group is converted to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The C=O bond in the formyl group is reduced, and the entire group is converted to a methyl group (-CH3).\n\n    The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated molecule containing one ring system.\n\n4.  **Calculate the IHD of the Product:**\n    We can determine the IHD of the product in two ways:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Change in IHD**\n        The reaction removes all four pi bonds from the reactant. The ring structure is preserved.\n        IHD(product) = IHD(reactant) - (Number of pi bonds reduced)\n        IHD(product) = 5 - 4\n        IHD(product) = 1\n        This remaining degree of unsaturation corresponds to the single ring in the product molecule.\n\n    *   **Method 2: From the Product's Molecular Formula**\n        Let's determine the molecular formula of the product. First, find the number of carbon atoms in the reactant:\n        - Cyclohexene ring: 6 C\n        - Carboxylic acid group: 1 C\n        - Formyl group: 1 C\n        - Vinyl group: 2 C\n        - Total carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 C.\n        The reaction does not change the number of carbon atoms. The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane) with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\n        Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C10H(2*10) = **C10H20**.\n        Now, calculate the IHD for C10H20 using the formula IHD = C - H/2 + 1:\n        IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n        IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n        IHD = 1\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1. This corresponds to the presence of the cyclohexane ring. Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) 1\n    B) 0\n    C) 3\n    D) 5\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
