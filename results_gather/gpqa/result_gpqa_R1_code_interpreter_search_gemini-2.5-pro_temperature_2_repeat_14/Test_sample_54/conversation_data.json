    "*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n    1.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This value is in the vinyl proton region (protons on a C=C double bond). The high chemical shift suggests it is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.\n        *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n        *   **Splitting (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, meaning this proton is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n        *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a large coupling constant for protons across a double bond. A J-value in the range of 12-18 Hz is characteristic of a *trans* configuration between two vinyl protons. A *cis* configuration would show a smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz). This is the key piece of information for determining the stereochemistry.\n\n    2.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinyl proton region.\n        *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n        *   **Splitting (dq, doublet of quartets):** This complex splitting pattern indicates the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n            *   The \"d\" (doublet) part arises from coupling to the single proton at 7.0 ppm (with the same J = 16.0 Hz).\n            *   The \"q\" (quartet) part arises from coupling to a group of three equivalent protons (n+1=4, so n=3), which must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n\n    3.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group in an acetate ester (`CH3-C(=O)O-`).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n        *   **Splitting (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with, which is consistent with an acetate group.\n\n    4.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n        *   **Splitting (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, meaning these three protons are coupled to a single adjacent proton. This matches the \"q\" splitting seen for the proton at 5.5 ppm (which is coupled to these three methyl protons).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   The molecule contains an acetate group (`CH3COO-`) from the singlet at 2.1 ppm.\n    *   The total integration (1+1+3+3 = 8 protons) corresponds to the formula for propenyl acetate (`C5H8O2`), not butenyl acetate (`C6H10O2`, which would have 10 protons). This eliminates options A and B.\n    *   The remaining fragments are `CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   Putting it together, the structure is `CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   The final step is to determine the stereochemistry around the double bond. The large coupling constant, `J = 16.0 Hz`, between the two vinyl protons (at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) definitively indicates a *trans* relationship.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The data corresponds to Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n    *   `trans-CH3(d)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-C(=O)-CH3(c)`\n    *   H(a): ~7.0 ppm, doublet, coupled to H(b). Downfield due to attached oxygen.\n    *   H(b): ~5.5 ppm, doublet of quartets, coupled to H(a) and the CH3(d) group.\n    *   CH3(c): ~2.1 ppm, singlet, acetate methyl group.\n    *   CH3(d): ~1.6 ppm, doublet, coupled to H(b).\n    *   The `J = 16.0 Hz` confirms the *trans* geometry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
