    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the spectral data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   A very broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n        *   A strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   Absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This chemical shift is typical for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broad singlet nature confirms this assignment.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. A pair of doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield shift of the 8.0 ppm signal indicates that these protons are ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group, which is the carboxylic acid. The 7.2 ppm signal corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** We need to assemble the remaining signals into an alkyl group:\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives us an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the -CH₂- group of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the adjacent -CH₃ group and another proton.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (-CH-).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This multiplet for one proton is the -CH- group. Its chemical shift suggests it is benzylic (directly attached to the benzene ring). It is coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (1.4 ppm) and the two protons of the methylene group (1.7 ppm).\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** We have an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) and a methyl group (-CH₃) both attached to a methine (-CH-) carbon. The structure of this group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in a para (1,4) arrangement. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is well-known for the complete reduction of carbonyl-containing functional groups, including aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids, to the corresponding alkane (CH₂ or CH₃).\n    *   **Transformation:** The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group, being an alkane substituent, and the aromatic ring itself will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the final product.**\n\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Product: The -COOH group is converted to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The side chain is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - Correct. This matches our derived product.\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material, Compound X.\n\n<<<C>>>"
