    "The user is asking to identify a biological process based on a described experiment. Let's break down the experimental details and connect them to immunological concepts.\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery and Site of Immune Response:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage. This means the antigen enters the body through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n    *   **Immune Response Site:** Fluorescent Peyer's patches are observed. Peyer's patches are a type of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which are secondary lymphoid organs. This is the primary site for initiating immune responses to antigens encountered in the intestines.\n\n2.  **Cellular Activity:**\n    *   **Proliferating cell population:** In a secondary lymphoid organ, an antigen encounter triggers the activation and proliferation (clonal expansion) of lymphocytes (B cells and T cells) that recognize that specific antigen. The observation of proliferating cells indicates an active immune response is underway. This proliferation occurs in structures called germinal centers.\n\n3.  **Genetic Observation:**\n    *   **High variability in the variable heavy chain gene:** The cells' variable heavy chain genes are sequenced. This gene region is responsible for forming the antigen-binding site of an antibody (or B cell receptor). The finding of \"high variability\" among this proliferating population of cells, which all started by recognizing the same antigen, points to a mechanism that introduces diversity *after* the initial antigen recognition.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which determines the antibody's effector function. It does *not* alter the *variable* region, and therefore does not account for the observed variability in the variable heavy chain gene.\n    *   **B) Complement activation:** This is part of the humoral innate immune system, a cascade of proteins that helps clear pathogens. It has no role in altering the genes of lymphocytes.\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a key process that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. B cells with mutations that increase their affinity for the antigen are then positively selected to survive and proliferate further (a process called affinity maturation). This process is the direct cause of \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating B cell population responding to an antigen. This matches the observations perfectly.\n    *   **D) VDJ recombination:** This process occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) during the initial development of B cells, *before* they encounter any antigen. It's responsible for creating the initial, vast diversity of B cell receptors by randomly combining V (Variable), D (Diversity), and J (Joining) gene segments. While it creates variability, it is not the process happening in a *proliferating cell population* within a *secondary lymphoid organ* in response to an antigen. The variability described in the question is being generated *during* the immune response, not before it.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of proliferating cells in a Peyer's patch showing high variability specifically in the variable heavy chain gene is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation occurring within a germinal center reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
