    "This question asks for the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is to treat a nucleon inside a nucleus as if it were a free particle during a high-energy interaction. Let's break down each statement to see how it contributes to this picture.\n\n1.  **Statement 1: \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is the most fundamental part of the approximation. It assumes that the probe (e.g., an electron, a neutrino) interacts with just one nucleon at a time. This neglects more complex interactions, such as those involving pairs of nucleons, known as meson-exchange currents (MEC), or interactions with the entire nucleus coherently. By assuming interaction with a single nucleon, we are taking the first step towards treating that nucleon as a distinct, quasi-free entity. This assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **Statement 2: \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This addresses what happens before and after the primary interaction. If the nucleus is not transparent, the incoming projectile could scatter off other nucleons before hitting the target one (initial-state interactions, ISI), and the outgoing particles (the scattered projectile and the struck nucleon) could interact with the remaining nucleons on their way out (final-state interactions, FSI). These secondary interactions would complicate the process significantly, and the final state would not resemble a free-nucleon interaction. Assuming transparency means we ignore ISI and FSI, which is a key part of the simplest form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation or PWIA). This assumption is also essential.\n\n3.  **Statement 3: \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This statement concerns the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself, describing it in terms of the constituent quark model. The impulse approximation, however, is a model of the nucleon's behavior *within the nucleus*. It treats the nucleon as the fundamental particle being struck. The internal physics of the nucleon (whether its quarks are relativistic or not) is a separate question that affects the calculation of nucleon form factors, but it is not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation itself. In fact, in deep inelastic scattering, where a similar impulse picture is used at a deeper level (the parton model), the quarks are treated as highly relativistic. Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **Statement 4: \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the \"impulse\" part of the name. It assumes that the interaction is very fast, occurring over a timescale much shorter than the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nuclear potential well. Because the \"hit\" is so sudden, the nucleon does not have time to interact with its neighbors or feel the binding potential during the event. It is struck \"impulsively\" and reacts as if it were a free particle with the momentum it happened to have just before the collision. This assumption is crucial.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTo treat a nucleon in a nucleus as a free particle for the purpose of an interaction, we must assume:\n- The interaction hits only that one nucleon (Statement 1).\n- The rest of the nucleus is \"invisible\" to the particles coming in and going out (Statement 2).\n- The nucleon is not bound during the brief moment of interaction (Statement 4).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
