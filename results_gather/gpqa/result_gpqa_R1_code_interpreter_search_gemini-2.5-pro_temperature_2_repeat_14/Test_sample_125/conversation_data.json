    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂(C=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   Let's number the carbon chain starting from the right to give the methoxy group the lowest number as per its name origin, though IUPAC would prefer numbering from the left to give the ketone a lower number (2-methoxyhexan-4-one). However, let's stick to the name provided: the carbonyl is at C3 and the methoxy is at C5. Structure: CH₃CH₂(C=O)CH₂CH(OCH₃)CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is chiral because of the stereocenter at C5, which is given in the (S) configuration. It is an enantiomerically pure starting material.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n    *   This reaction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3. The carbonyl carbon is planar (sp² hybridized), and the hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either face.\n    *   Because the starting molecule already contains a stereocenter (at C5), the two faces of the carbonyl are diastereotopic. The attack is not equally likely from both sides, leading to an unequal mixture of diastereomers. However, *both* possible diastereomers will be formed, as these reactions are rarely 100% diastereoselective.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It has two stereocenters, at C3 and C5.\n    *   Since the stereocenter at C5 remains (S), the new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The two products are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are **diastereomers** of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-(C=O)-CH₂-(C=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" means both carbonyl groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   We need to consider all possible stereoisomers. With 2 stereocenters, there is a maximum of 2² = 4 stereoisomers.\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Let's check for relationships:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be formed as a 1:1 mixture (a racemic mixture).\n        *   Now consider (2R, 4S). If we look at this molecule, it has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the C3-CH₂ group. This makes it an achiral **meso compound**. Its mirror image, (2S, 4R), is superimposable on the original (2R, 4S) molecule. So, they are the same compound.\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   Thus, Reaction II produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: the racemic pair of (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), and the meso compound (2R, 4S).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Products with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Key principle:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated.\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomers, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), will not separate and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, giving a second peak.\n    *   This gives a total of **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The products of Reaction I (C₇ alcohols) and Reaction II (C₅ diols) are structurally very different and will not co-elute by chance.\n    *   Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Products with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is a **chiral** separation technique.\n*   **Key principle:** A chiral column can separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers. Essentially, it can resolve all different stereoisomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers, (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S). They are both chiral and different compounds, so they will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomers, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), will be separated by the chiral column. This gives 2 distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound is achiral, but it is a distinct stereoisomer and will be separated from the other two compounds. This gives a third peak.\n    *   This gives a total of **3 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Again, assuming no accidental co-elution between the products of the two different reactions.\n    *   Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 3 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to the option that states \"5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\".\n\n<<<B>>>"
