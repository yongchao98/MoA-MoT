    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation for the enthalpy of formation.\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 to count the number of atoms and the types of bonds.\n\n*   **Structure breakdown:**\n    *   `(CH3)2C=`: A carbon double-bonded to the next, and single-bonded to two methyl (CH3) groups.\n    *   `=CH-`: A CH group connected by a double bond and a single bond.\n    *   `-CH2-`: A CH2 group.\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-`: A CH group with a methyl group attached.\n    *   `-CH2-`: Another CH2 group.\n    *   `-CH=`: A CH group connected by a single bond and a double bond.\n    *   `=C(CH3)2`: A carbon double-bonded to the previous, and single-bonded to two methyl groups.\n\n*   **Counting Atoms:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** (1+2) + 1 + 1 + (1+1) + 1 + 1 + (1+2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** (3*2) + 1 + 2 + (1+3) + 2 + 1 + (3*2) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Counting Bonds:**\n    *   **C=C double bonds:** There are two in the structure, at (CH3)2**C=CH** and C**H=C**(CH3)2. So, **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-H single bonds:** This is simply the number of hydrogen atoms. So, **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C-C single bonds:** In a non-cyclic molecule, the total number of bonds between carbon atoms is (Total C atoms - 1). Here, 12 - 1 = 11. Since we have 2 C=C bonds, the remaining must be C-C single bonds. So, 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom, compound)**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound to form gaseous atoms. It is the sum of the bond energies of all bonds.\n\n*   **ΔH_atom, compound** = (2 × BE(C=C)) + (9 × BE(C-C)) + (22 × BE(C-H))\n*   Using the given values:\n    *   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n    *   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n    *   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   **ΔH_atom, compound** = (2 × 300) + (9 × 200) + (22 × 400) = 600 + 1800 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements (ΔH_atom, elements)**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C(s, graphite) and H2(g)) to gaseous atoms (C(g) and H(g)). The formation reaction is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\nWe need to form 12 moles of C(g) and 22 moles of H(g).\n\n*   **ΔH_atom, elements** = (12 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\n    *   Note: We need 22 H atoms, which come from 11 H2 molecules. The energy to break 11 moles of H2 is 11 × BE(H-H).\n*   Using the given values:\n    *   ΔH_atom(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\n    *   BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol\n*   **ΔH_atom, elements** = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is related to the enthalpies of atomization by the following Hess's cycle relationship:\n**ΔH_f = ΔH_atom(elements) - ΔH_atom(compound)**\n\n*   **ΔH_f** = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### **5. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check against the options.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × 12.0) + (22 × 1.0) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **ΔH_f in kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (ΔH_f (kJ/mol)) / (Molar Mass (g/mol))\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol, which is equivalent to 11.44 kJ/g.\nLet's check the options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g (Incorrect unit)\nB) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its formation)\nC) 11.44 kJ/g (This matches our calculation)\nD) 67.4 kJ/mol (Incorrect value)\n\nThe correct option is C.

    "Here is a summary of the calculation process:\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Bond Counting:**\nThe molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n*   **Carbon atoms (C):** 12\n*   **Hydrogen atoms (H):** 22\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C12H22\n*   **C=C double bonds:** 2\n*   **C-H single bonds:** 22\n*   **C-C single bonds:** Total carbon-carbon bonds are (12-1) = 11. Since 2 are double bonds, there are 11 - 2 = 9 C-C single bonds.\n\n**2. Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom_compound):**\nThis is the energy needed to break all bonds in one mole of the compound.\nΔH_atom_compound = (2 × BE(C=C)) + (9 × BE(C-C)) + (22 × BE(C-H))\nΔH_atom_compound = (2 × 300) + (9 × 200) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atom_compound = 600 + 1800 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**3.

Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f):**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when the compound's bonds are formed (which is equal in magnitude to the compound's enthalpy of atomization).\nΔH_f = ΔH_atom_elements - ΔH_atom_compound\nΔH_f = 13100 - 11200 = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Convert to kJ/g:**\nThe options include a value in kJ/g, so we must perform this conversion.\n*   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12.0) + (22 × 1.0) = 166 g/mol.\n*   Enthalpy in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.45 kJ/g**.\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\n*   A) 1900 kJ/g -> The value is correct, but the unit is wrong. Our calculation is 1900 kJ/mol.\n*   B) 11200 kJ/mol -> This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not the enthalpy of formation.\n*   C) 11.44 kJ/g -> This matches our calculated value of 11.45 kJ/g. The minor difference is due to rounding.\n*   D) 67.4 kJ/mol -> Incorrect value.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
