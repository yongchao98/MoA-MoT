    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium. Since the stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can use this equation.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms ($N_i$) in an energy state $i$ to the number of atoms ($N_j$) in an energy state $j$ is given by:\n\n    $ \\frac{N_i}{N_j} = \\frac{g_i}{g_j} e^{(-(E_i - E_j))/(k_B T)} $\n\n    where:\n    *   $g_i$ and $g_j$ are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the energy levels $i$ and $j$.\n    *   $E_i - E_j = \\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n    *   $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Interpreting the Problem Statement**: The phrase \"atoms... are twice as excited\" refers to the ratio of the population of a specific excited energy level to the population of a reference level (typically the ground state). Let's call this the \"excitation ratio\", $R$.\n\n    *   For star 1, with temperature $T_1$, the excitation ratio is:\n        $ R_1 = \\frac{N_{exc,1}}{N_{g,1}} = \\frac{g_{exc}}{g_{g}} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)} $\n\n    *   For star 2, with temperature $T_2$, the excitation ratio is:\n        $ R_2 = \\frac{N_{exc,2}}{N_{g,2}} = \\frac{g_{exc}}{g_{g}} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)} $\n\n    The problem states that atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means:\n    $ R_1 = 2 \\times R_2 $\n\n3.  **Setting up the Equation**: We can now set up an equation by dividing $R_1$ by $R_2$:\n\n    $ \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \\frac{\\frac{g_{exc}}{g_{g}} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)}}{\\frac{g_{exc}}{g_{g}} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)}} = 2 $\n\n    The statistical weights $g_{exc}$ and $g_{g}$ are properties of the iron atom and are the same regardless of the star, so they cancel out:\n\n    $ \\frac{e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)}}{e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)}} = 2 $\n\n4.  **Solving for the Temperatures**: Now, we solve this equation for the relationship between $T_1$ and $T_2$.\n\n    *   Using the property of exponents, $e^a / e^b = e^{a-b}$:\n        $ e^{(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_1}) - (-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_2})} = 2 $\n        $ e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B}(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1})} = 2 $\n\n    *   Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        $ \\ln(e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B}(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1})}) = \\ln(2) $\n        $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B}(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}) = \\ln(2) $\n\n    *   Combine the terms in the parentheses by finding a common denominator ($T_1 T_2$):\n        $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} \\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = \\ln(2) $\n\n5.  **Using the Given Numerical Values**: The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference, $\\Delta E = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J.\n    *   The value of the Boltzmann constant is $k_B \\approx 1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.\n\n    The values given in the problem are set up so that their ratio is approximately 1:\n    $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} = \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}} = 1 \\text{ K} $\n\n6.  **Final Equation**: Substituting this value back into our derived equation:\n\n    $ (1) \\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = \\ln(2) $\n    $ \\ln(2) = \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} $\n\nThis matches option B. A physical check confirms this is correct: since star 1 is \"more excited\" ($R_1 > R_2$), its temperature must be higher ($T_1 > T_2$). The equation $\\ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2)/(T_1T_2)$ is consistent with this, as $\\ln(2)$ is positive, requiring $T_1 - T_2$ to be positive.\n\n<<<B>>>"
