    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    To simplify the problem, we convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the relations:\n    *   x = r * cos(θ)\n    *   y = r * sin(θ)\n    *   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (r * cos(θ))^2\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * x^2\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Combine the terms:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 * kx^2 + 3/2 * kx^2) + 1/2 * ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2) * kx^2 + 1/2 * ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 * ky^2\n\n4.  **Identify the System:**\n    The resulting potential V(x, y) is the sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\n    *   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n    *   V_y(y) = 1/2 * ky^2\n    This represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n5.  **Separate the Schrödinger Equation:**\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation in 2D is:\n    Hψ = Eψ\n    Where the Hamiltonian H can be written as H = H_x + H_y:\n    *   H_x = - (ħ^2 / 2m) * (d^2/dx^2) + V_x(x)\n    *   H_y = - (ħ^2 / 2m) * (d^2/dy^2) + V_y(y)\n\n    Because the Hamiltonian is separable, the total energy E is the sum of the energy eigenvalues from each dimension: E = E_x + E_y.\n\n6.  **Solve for Energy Eigenvalues in the x-direction:**\n    The potential for the x-direction is V_x(x) = 2kx^2.\n    We compare this to the standard 1D quantum harmonic oscillator potential, V(x) = 1/2 * mω^2 * x^2.\n    1/2 * mω_x^2 = 2k\n    ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n    ω_x = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω. So for the x-direction (with quantum number n_x):\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n    E_{n_x} = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n7.  **Solve for Energy Eigenvalues in the y-direction:**\n    The potential for the y-direction is V_y(y) = 1/2 * ky^2.\n    Again, we compare this to V(y) = 1/2 * mω^2 * y^2.\n    1/2 * mω_y^2 = 1/2 * k\n    ω_y^2 = k/m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-direction (with quantum number n_y) are:\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy E is the sum of the energies for the x and y motions:\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m). This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
