    "The user wants to find the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state for a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**1. Identify the System and Energy Spectrum**\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The Hamiltonian for this system can be separated in Cartesian coordinates, $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$, where each $H_i$ is a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i=0, 1, 2, ...$.\n\nFor the 3D isotropic case, the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$.\nThe energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n**2. Determine the Energy of the Third Excited State**\nThe energy levels are determined by the value of the principal quantum number $n$.\n*   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy state, which corresponds to $n=0$.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**3. Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that correspond to the same energy. This means we need to find the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n$.\nFor the third excited state, we need to find the number of solutions to:\n$n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z \\ge 0$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. The number of such combinations (degeneracy $g_n$) is given by the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy eigenvalue is equal to the degeneracy of that energy level. Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.\n\nWe can also list the combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ to verify this:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). (3 states)\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). (6 states)\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1: (1,1,1). (1 state)\n\nTotal number of states = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the degeneracy (the number of possible linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\nB) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\nC) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\nD) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
