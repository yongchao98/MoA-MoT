    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 4 usually indicates a benzene ring. The remaining DBE of 1 suggests an additional pi bond, most likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** These two medium-to-strong bands are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is consistent with a conjugated ester (an ester group attached to an aromatic ring).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH3) with three protons. The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a group with two protons (n+1=3, so n=2), most likely a methylene (-CH2-) group. This suggests the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH2-) with two protons. The quartet (q) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a group with three protons (n+1=4, so n=3), confirming it is coupled to the methyl group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates that this -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which is characteristic of an oxygen in an ester (R-COO-CH2-). Thus, we have an ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet represents two exchangeable protons, which is consistent with the primary amine (-NH2) group identified from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift between the two doublets indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n    2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH2)**, which is an electron-donating group.\n    3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**, which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\n    The structure that fits all these pieces of evidence is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n    *   The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group appear upfield (7.0 ppm).\n    *   The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group appear downfield (8.0 ppm).\n    *   This structure matches the molecular formula (C9H11NO2).\n    *   This structure is consistent with all spectral data.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group would be part of a propionate (-OCOCH2CH3), and its -CH2- signal would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure is a perfect match for all the data.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester. The IR would show a single N-H band and an amide carbonyl stretch at a lower frequency (~1680 cm-1).\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted ring, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n\n<<<B>>>"
