    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I need to analyze a set of experimental data for a synthesized peptide and choose the best explanation from four options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Experimental Data:**\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   Observation: Two peaks for a *single* alpha-proton.\n        *   Characteristics: Similar chemical shifts, integrals are roughly equal and sum to 1H.\n        *   Constraint: Spin-spin coupling is *not* the cause.\n        *   Interpretation: This means the sample contains two distinct molecular species. The alpha-proton in species 1 is in a slightly different chemical environment than the alpha-proton in species 2. Since the integrals are roughly equal, the two species are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio. The fact that they both correspond to the same alpha-proton and sum to 1H confirms we are looking at two versions of the *same* proton in the molecule, not two different protons.\n\n    *   **LC-MS:**\n        *   Observation: Two clearly defined peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC).\n        *   Characteristics: Equal intensities.\n        *   Interpretation: The LC is separating the crude mixture into two components. The equal intensities again suggest a ~1:1 ratio of these two components. The fact that the analysis is at \"elevated temperature\" and the peaks are \"clearly defined\" suggests these are not easily interconvertible species (like some very fast rotamers that would coalesce into a single broad peak at high temp). They are stable enough to be separated by chromatography.\n\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n        *   Observation: Both LC peaks give the *same mass spectrum*.\n        *   Characteristics: The mass spectrum is \"consistent with the expected molecule.\"\n        *   Interpretation: This is the most crucial piece of information. The two species being separated by the LC have the exact same molecular mass, and that mass is the correct one for the target peptide. This means they are isomers of the target molecule.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   If 'double coupling' means an extra amino acid was added, the molecule would be larger.\n        *   This would result in a *different* and *higher* mass in the MS.\n        *   This contradicts the MS data, which shows both peaks have the mass of the *expected* molecule.\n        *   Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have the same chemical formula and connectivity, thus the same mass. Common examples in peptides include epimers (racemization at one chiral center) or rotamers (*cis/trans* isomers around a peptide bond, which are also a type of diastereomer).\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and exist in different chemical environments. Therefore, they would produce two distinct sets of NMR signals. It is very common for corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers to have similar, but not identical, chemical shifts. This matches the observation of two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **Consistency with LC:** Because they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, shape), diastereoisomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This would result in two separate peaks, as observed.\n        *   **Consistency with MS:** Diastereoisomers have the same molecular formula, so they have the identical molecular weight. This would result in identical mass spectra for both LC peaks, which is exactly what was observed.\n        *   Conclusion: This option is perfectly consistent with all the provided data.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have the same mass.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would give only a *single* set of peaks, not two.\n        *   **Consistency with LC:** Using a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are not separable and would elute as a *single* peak.\n        *   The observations (two NMR peaks, two LC peaks) directly contradict the properties of enantiomers under standard analysis conditions.\n        *   Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate in the synthesis. It is a different chemical compound from the final product.\n        *   As a different compound, it would almost certainly have a different molecular weight.\n        *   The MS data shows both separated components have the *same mass* as the expected product.\n        *   This contradicts the idea of a precursor contaminant, which would have a different mass.\n        *   Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** Only option B, a mixture of diastereoisomers, explains all the experimental observations simultaneously. The data strongly points to the presence of two isomers that have the same mass (isomers), are separable by LC (not enantiomers), and are distinguishable by NMR (not enantiomers). This is the definition of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<B>>>"
