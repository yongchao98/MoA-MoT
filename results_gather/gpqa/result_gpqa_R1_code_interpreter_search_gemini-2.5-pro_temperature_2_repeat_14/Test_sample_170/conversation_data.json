    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is the electrophilic bromination of a substituted benzene ring (C6H5-X). The incoming electrophile (Br+) will add to the ring at a position determined by the electronic and steric properties of the substituent 'X'.\n\n*   **Electronic Effects (Directing Effects):**\n    *   **Activating Groups (Electron-Donating Groups, EDGs):** These groups increase the electron density of the ring, particularly at the *ortho* and *para* positions. They are *ortho, para*-directors. Examples from the list: `-CH3`, `-C2H5`.\n    *   **Deactivating Groups (Electron-Withdrawing Groups, EWGs):** These groups decrease the electron density of the ring. Most are *meta*-directors because the *meta* position is the least deactivated. Examples from the list: `-NO2`, `-COOC2H5`, `-COOH`.\n    *   **Halogens (-Cl):** This is a special case. Halogens are deactivating due to their strong inductive effect (-I) but are *ortho, para*-directing due to their resonance effect (+M).\n\n*   **Steric Effects:**\n    *   The size of the substituent 'X' can hinder the approach of the electrophile (Br+) to the nearby *ortho* positions. Larger substituents generally lead to a higher proportion of the *para*-isomer compared to the *ortho*-isomer.\n\n### **2. Initial Sorting based on Directing Effects**\n\nWe can split the substances into two groups:\n\n*   **Group 1 (Meta-directors):** These will produce very little of the para-isomer. The major product is the meta-isomer.\n    *   `4) C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   `6) C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   `2) C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Group 2 (Ortho, para-directors):** These will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer.\n    *   `1) C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n    *   `5) C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   `3) C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nTherefore, any substance from Group 1 will have a lower para-isomer yield than any substance from Group 2. The final ranked list will look like: (Group 1 substances) < (Group 2 substances).\n\n### **3. Ranking within Group 1 (Meta-directors)**\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer for these substances will be very low. The order depends on the strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect. The stronger the meta-directing effect, the lower the yield of the unwanted para-isomer.\n\nThe deactivating strength of these groups is generally accepted as:\n`-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`\n\n*   `-NO2` is a very powerful deactivating group, directing almost exclusively to the meta position. It will produce the *least* amount of para-isomer.\n*   `-COOH` is a strong deactivator.\n*   `-COOC2H5` is also a strong deactivator, but slightly weaker than `-COOH`. The ethyl group (+I effect) slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing character of the carbonyl group compared to the acidic proton in `-COOH`.\n\nThus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n`4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5)`\n\n### **4. Ranking within Group 2 (Ortho, para-directors)**\n\nFor these substances, we need to consider the para:ortho ratio. A higher ratio means a higher yield of the para-isomer. This ratio is primarily influenced by the steric hindrance caused by the substituent. A bulkier group will block the ortho positions more effectively, favoring the formation of the para-isomer.\n\nLet's evaluate the steric bulk of the substituents: `-CH3`, `-C2H5`, `-Cl`.\n\n*   **-CH3 vs. -C2H5:** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is larger and more sterically demanding than the methyl group (`-CH3`). Therefore, ethylbenzene will have a higher para:ortho ratio than toluene. This means the para-isomer yield for `C6H5-C2H5` is greater than for `C6H5-CH3`.\n*   **-Cl:** The chlorine atom is a single atom, but it is larger than a carbon atom. Due to its size and electronic repulsion, it provides significant steric hindrance at the ortho positions. Experimental data for bromination consistently shows that chlorobenzene gives a very high para:ortho ratio, even higher than that for alkylbenzenes. For bromination, chlorobenzene gives about 87% para-product.\n\nThus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group, based on increasing steric hindrance, is:\n`-CH3` < `-C2H5` < `-Cl`\nThis corresponds to the substance order: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\n### **5. Final Combination**\n\nCombining the two ranked groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n`(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)`\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
