    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, with either (R) or (S) stereochemistry. Let's break down this name:\n*   `pyran`: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   `tetrahydro- ... -2-one`: It is a saturated ring with a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position. This specific structure, a cyclic ester, is called a lactone. Because it's a 6-membered ring, it's a delta-lactone.\n*   `4-ethyl`: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   `(R)` or `(S)`: This denotes the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is the C4 carbon bearing the ethyl group.\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of hydroxy-carboxylic acids. A six-membered delta-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid.\nLet's identify the specific hydroxy acid precursor for `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   The lactone ring is O¹-C²(=O)-C³H₂-C⁴H(Et)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₂.\n*   If we conceptually \"open\" the ester bond (between O¹ and C²), we get a carboxylic acid at C² and a hydroxyl group at C⁶.\n*   The open-chain precursor is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)`.\n*   Note that the chiral center in the acid is at C3, which corresponds to the C4 chiral center in the lactone. Therefore, cyclization of `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will yield `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, and the `(S)` acid will yield the `(S)` lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\nLet's decode this name:\n*   `pentanoic acid`: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at C1.\n*   `3-ethyl`: An ethyl group at C3. This is the chiral center.\n*   `5-isobutoxy-5-oxo`: This describes the group at C5. It's a combination of a carbonyl (`oxo`) and an isobutoxy group, which indicates an isobutyl ester (`-COO-isobutyl`).\nSo, the structure is `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COO-isobutyl(5)`. This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n\nThe two reducing agents show different chemoselectivity:\n*   `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride): A relatively mild reducing agent that reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters. It does **not** typically reduce carboxylic acids because it first deprotonates them to form a very unreactive carboxylate anion.\n*   `BH₃` (Borane): A powerful reducing agent that is particularly effective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It is much more reactive towards carboxylic acids than esters.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` will selectively reduce the ester group (`-COO-isobutyl` at C5) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH` at C1) untouched.\n    *   `A` (`HOOC...CH(Et)...COOR`) → `HOOC...CH(Et)...CH₂OH`\n*   This intermediate is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n*   Acid workup (`H⁺`) causes this hydroxy-acid to cyclize into the 6-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material `A` directly determines the stereochemistry of the product. To get the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material `A` must be `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH` at C1) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while leaving the ester group (`-COO-isobutyl` at C5) untouched.\n    *   `B` (`HOOC...CH(Et)...COOR`) → `HOCH₂...CH(Et)...COOR`\n*   The intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n*   Acid workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed `-OH` group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   Let's verify the ring size. The intermediate is `HO-CH₂¹⁻CH₂²-CH(Et)³-CH₂⁴-C(=O)⁵OR`. The attacking oxygen (from C1) and the carbons C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 form the ring. This is a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction happens at the achiral end of the molecule, and the cyclization does not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry of the starting material `B` directly determines the stereochemistry of the product. To get the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material `B` must be `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
