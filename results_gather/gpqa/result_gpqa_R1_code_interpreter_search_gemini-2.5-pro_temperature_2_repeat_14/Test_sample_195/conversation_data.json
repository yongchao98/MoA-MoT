    "Here is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The problem involves a harmonic oscillator where the speeds can be relativistic. Therefore, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically the concepts of relativistic energy and the conservation of energy.\n\n2.  **Define the system's energy:** The total energy of the mass in the potential field is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy. The potential energy for a spring obeying Hooke's law ($F = -kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. The relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ is $E_{rel} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light. The relativistic energy $E_{rel}$ includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n\n3.  **Apply the law of conservation of energy:** The total energy $E_{total}$ of the system is conserved throughout the oscillation.\n    $E_{total} = E_{rel} + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\text{constant}$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the energy at two key points in the oscillation:**\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum displacement (amplitude).**\n        At this point, $x = A$. The mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v=0$.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n        The potential energy is maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        The total energy at this point is $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position.**\n        At this point, $x = 0$. The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n        The speed of the mass is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-(v_{max}/c)^2}}$.\n        The total energy at this point is $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n5.  **Equate the energies:** Since total energy is conserved, the energy at Point 1 equals the energy at Point 2.\n    $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n6.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:**\n    First, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing the equation by $mc^2$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$.\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$.\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we perform the following algebraic steps:\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$.\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$.\n    *   Rearrange to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$.\n    *   Take the square root of both sides and multiply by $c$:\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$.\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:** The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option C exactly.\n\n8.  **Alternative approach (Work-Energy Theorem):**\n    The work done by the conservative spring force as the mass moves from a point $x_1$ to $x_2$ is equal to the change in its relativistic kinetic energy, $\\Delta K = K_2 - K_1$.\n    Let's consider the motion from maximum amplitude ($x=A$) to the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n    *   Work done by the spring: $W_{A \\to 0} = \\int_A^0 F dx = \\int_A^0 (-kx) dx = -k[\\frac{x^2}{2}]_A^0 = -k(0 - \\frac{A^2}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   Change in kinetic energy: $\\Delta K = K_{max} - K_{at A}$.\n    *   At $x=A$, $v=0$, so the kinetic energy $K_{at A} = (\\gamma-1)mc^2 = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\n    *   At $x=0$, the kinetic energy is maximum: $K_{max} = (\\gamma_{max}-1)mc^2$.\n    *   By the work-energy theorem, $W_{A \\to 0} = \\Delta K$.\n        $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max}-1)mc^2$.\n    *   This leads to the same intermediate equation: $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$, and thus the same final result.\n\n9.  **Sanity Check (Classical Limit):** In the non-relativistic limit, the potential energy is much smaller than the rest energy ($ \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 \\ll mc^2 $). Let $\\epsilon = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \\ll 1$.\n    Our result is $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - (1+\\epsilon)^{-2}}$.\n    Using the binomial approximation $(1+\\epsilon)^n \\approx 1+n\\epsilon$ for small $\\epsilon$:\n    $(1+\\epsilon)^{-2} \\approx 1 - 2\\epsilon$.\n    $v_{max} \\approx c \\sqrt{1 - (1 - 2\\epsilon)} = c \\sqrt{2\\epsilon}$.\n    Substituting $\\epsilon$ back:\n    $v_{max} \\approx c \\sqrt{2 \\left(\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$.\n    This is the well-known classical result for the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator, which we get by equating $\\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$. The fact that our relativistic formula correctly reduces to the classical one in the appropriate limit gives us confidence in the answer.\n\nBased on the consistent derivation from fundamental principles and the correct classical limit, the answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
