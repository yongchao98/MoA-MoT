    "This problem involves the concept of time dilation in special relativity and the exponential decay of particles.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics:**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** Unstable particles decay over time. The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial population `N0` after a time `t'` in the particle's own reference frame (its proper time) is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t') = N0 * exp(-t' / τ)`, where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n*   **Time Dilation:** From our perspective in the lab (the detector's frame), the particle's internal clock runs slower. If a time `t` passes in the lab frame, the proper time `t'` that passes for the moving particle is `t' = t / γ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Travel Time:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to travel the detector radius `d` in the lab frame is `t = d / v ≈ d / c`.\n\n**2. Formulate the Equation:**\n\nCombining these concepts, we can find the fraction of particles (`N/N0`) that reach the detector wall.\n\n*   The proper time elapsed for a particle to reach the wall is `t' = t / γ ≈ (d/c) / γ`.\n*   Substituting this into the decay equation gives the survival fraction:\n    `N/N0 = exp(-t' / τ) = exp(-d / (γ * c * τ))`\n\nLet's call the survival fraction `f`. So, `f = exp(-d / (γ * c * τ))`.\nWe can rearrange this equation by taking the natural logarithm:\n`ln(f) = -d / (γ * c * τ)`\n`γ * -ln(f) = d / (c * τ)`\n\nThe term `d / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup, as `d`, `c`, and `τ` do not change.\n\n**3. Use the Initial Condition:**\n\nThe problem states that when the Lorentz factor `γ1` is 20, the survival fraction `f1` is 1/3.\n\n*   `γ1 = 20`\n*   `f1 = 1/3`\n*   `20 * -ln(1/3) = d / (c * τ)`\n*   Since `-ln(1/3) = ln(3)`, we have:\n    `20 * ln(3) = d / (c * τ)`\n\n**4. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor:**\n\nWe need to find the new Lorentz factor `γ2` that results in a survival fraction `f2` of 2/3.\n\n*   `γ2 = ?`\n*   `f2 = 2/3`\n*   `γ2 * -ln(2/3) = d / (c * τ)`\n*   Since `-ln(2/3) = ln(3/2)`, we have:\n    `γ2 * ln(3/2) = d / (c * τ)`\n\n**5. Combine the Equations:**\n\nNow we have two expressions for the constant `d / (c * τ)`. We can set them equal to each other:\n\n`γ2 * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nNow, solve for `γ2`:\n\n`γ2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\nLet's compute the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We need to calculate gamma2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\ngamma2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(3/2)\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n>54.18985161329431\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.\n\nLooking at the options:\nA) 28\nB) 68\nC) 40\nD) 54\n\nThe closest option is 54.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem relates the survival fraction of decaying particles to their Lorentz factor. The survival fraction `N/N0` is determined by the exponential decay law `N(t') = N0 * exp(-t'/τ)`, where `t'` is the proper time experienced by the particle and `τ` is its mean proper lifetime.\n\n**1. Relate Lab Time and Proper Time**\n\n*   The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n*   The time it takes for a particle to travel the detector radius `d = 30 m` in the lab frame is `t = d/v ≈ d/c`.\n*   Due to time dilation, the proper time `t'` experienced by the particle is shorter than the lab time `t` by a factor of `γ` (the Lorentz factor): `t' = t/γ`.\n*   Substituting `t ≈ d/c`, we get `t' ≈ (d/c) / γ`.\n\n**2. Formulate the Survival Equation**\n\nThe fraction of particles surviving, `f = N/N0`, can be written as:\n`f = exp(-t'/τ) = exp(-d / (γ * c * τ))`\n\nThe term `c*τ` is the mean decay length of the particle in its own rest frame. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for `γ`:\n`ln(f) = -d / (γ * c * τ)`\n`γ * ln(1/f) = d / (c * τ)`\n\nThe quantity `d / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific type of particle and detector setup.\n\n**3. Use the Initial Conditions**\n\nWe are given that for the first case:\n*   Lorentz factor `γ1 = 20`\n*   Survival fraction `f1 = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these into the equation:\n`20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) = d / (c * τ)`\n`20 * ln(3) = d / (c * τ)`\n\nThis gives us the value of the constant `d / (c * τ)`.\n\n**4. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor**\n\nNow, we need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ2`, for the second case:\n*   Lorentz factor `γ2 = ?`\n*   Survival fraction `f2 = 2/3`\n\nPlugging these into the same equation format:\n`γ2 * ln(1 / (2/3)) = d / (c * τ)`\n`γ2 * ln(3/2) = d / (c * τ)`\n\n**5. Combine and Calculate**\n\nWe now have two expressions for the same constant `d / (c * τ)`. We can set them equal to each other:\n`γ2 * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nNow, solve for `γ2`:\n`γ2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\nWe can compute the numerical value:\n`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n`ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n`γ2 = 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 28\nB) 68\nC) 40\nD) 54\n\nThe closest answer is 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
