    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Initial State & Dilution**\n\n*   First, we need to determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted.\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH):\n    `moles = Concentration × Volume`\n    `moles = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol`\n*   The initial volume was 20.00 cm³ (0.0200 L). We add 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   New total volume:\n    `V_total = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L`\n*   Concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution:\n    `C_diluted = moles / V_total = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M`\n\n**2. Titration Reaction & Equivalence Point**\n\n*   The titration reaction is between a weak acid (CH3COOH) and a strong base (NaOH):\n    `CH3COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) -> CH3COONa(aq) + H2O(l)`\n*   At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of CH3COOH.\n*   Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence (V_eq):\n    `moles_acid = C_NaOH × V_eq`\n    `0.001 mol = 0.1 mol/L × V_eq`\n    `V_eq = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 mL`\n\n**3. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At 25% titration, we have added 25% of the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence.\n    `V_NaOH_added = 0.25 × 10.00 mL = 2.50 mL`\n*   Moles of NaOH added:\n    `moles_NaOH = 0.1 mol/L × 0.00250 L = 0.00025 mol`\n*   At this point, some of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-), creating a buffer solution.\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH remaining = `Initial moles - moles NaOH added`\n        `= 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol`\n    *   Moles of CH3COO- formed = `moles NaOH added`\n        `= 0.00025 mol`\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer:\n    `pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])`\n    where A⁻ is the conjugate base (CH3COO⁻) and HA is the weak acid (CH3COOH). Since they are in the same solution, we can use the ratio of their moles.\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵)`\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    `pH = pKa + log(moles of CH3COO⁻ / moles of CH3COOH)`\n    `pH = pKa + log(0.00025 / 0.00075)`\n    `pH = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3)`\n*   Calculation:\n    `pKa ≈ 4.7328`\n    `pH ≈ 4.7328 - log(3) ≈ 4.7328 - 0.4771 = 4.2557`\n    Rounding gives **pH ≈ 4.26**.\n\n**4. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the initial 0.001 mol of CH3COOH has reacted with 0.001 mol of NaOH to form 0.001 mol of sodium acetate (CH3COONa).\n*   The solution now consists of the conjugate base, CH3COO⁻, dissolved in water. This base will hydrolyze water, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n    `CH3COO⁻(aq) + H2O(l) ⇌ CH3COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)`\n*   We need to find the concentration of the CH3COO⁻ ion.\n    *   Total volume = `Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added`\n        `= 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.0500 L`\n    *   Concentration of CH3COO⁻:\n        `[CH3COO⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M`\n*   Now we use the base hydrolysis constant, Kb, for the acetate ion.\n    `Kb = Kw / Ka` (where Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C)\n    `Kb = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰`\n*   Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis to find the [OH⁻] at equilibrium. Let [OH⁻] = x.\n    `Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)`\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`.\n    `5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02`\n    `x² ≈ (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹`\n    `x = [OH⁻] = sqrt(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M`\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    `pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483`\n    `pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517`\n    Rounding gives **pH ≈ 8.52**.\n\nI will use Python to verify these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants and Initial Values ---\ninitial_vol_acid_L = 0.0200\ninitial_conc_acid_M = 0.05\nconc_NaOH_M = 0.1\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution ---\ninitial_moles_acid = initial_conc_acid_M * initial_vol_acid_L\ndiluted_vol_acid_L = 0.0400\ndiluted_conc_acid_M = initial_moles_acid / diluted_vol_acid_L\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3.\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Moles of NaOH added = initial moles of acid = 0.001 mol\nvol_NaOH_eq_L = initial_moles_acid / conc_NaOH_M\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq_L = diluted_vol_acid_L + vol_NaOH_eq_L\n# Concentration of acetate (A-) at equivalence\nconc_A_minus_eq = initial_moles_acid / total_vol_eq_L\n\n# Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-], so [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\n# Approximation is valid since Kb is small.\nconc_OH_minus = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus_eq)\n\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH_minus)\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH_eq\n\n# --- Print Results ---\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\nThe calculated values from the step-by-step reasoning and the Python script are consistent.\n*   pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n*   pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\n\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):\n    `Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol`\n*   The initial volume of 20.00 cm³ (0.0200 L) is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   The new total volume is `20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L`.\n*   The new concentration of the diluted acetic acid is:\n    `Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M`\n\n**2. Calculate pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution where 75% of the acid remains and 25% has become the conjugate base. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n`pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])`\n\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73`\n*   The ratio `[A⁻]/[HA]` is `25% / 75% = 1/3`.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    `pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - log(3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253`\n*   Rounding gives a pH of **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the weak conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic.\n\n`CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)`\n\n*   **Find the volume and concentration at equivalence:**\n    *   Volume of NaOH needed: `(Moles Acid) / (Conc. NaOH) = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 mL`\n    *   Total volume = `40.00 mL (diluted acid) + 10.00 mL (NaOH) = 50.00 mL = 0.050 L`\n    *   Concentration of acetate `[CH₃COO⁻]` = `Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M`\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   Calculate Kb for acetate: `Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰`\n    *   Use the approximation for a weak base: `[OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻])`\n    *   `[OH⁻] = sqrt((5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02) = sqrt(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M`\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   `pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48`\n    *   `pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52`\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
