    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and analyze its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1\n\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for the alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid. While the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3 as a catalyst, this is an alternative method to achieve the same transformation. The key step is the halogenation of the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   **Transformation:** CH3COOH → BrCH2COOH\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Transformation:** BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate.\n\n### Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile that attacks the carbon atom bonded to the bromine, displacing the bromide ion, which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Transformation:** BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NC-CH2COOCH2CH3 + NaBr\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NC-CH2COOEt) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and then 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a double alkylation reaction.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Ethyl cyanoacetate has acidic protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups. The strong base, sodium hydride (NaH), deprotonates this carbon to form a stable carbanion (an enolate). The use of excess NaH ensures all the ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated.\n        NC-CH2COOEt + NaH → [NC-CHCOOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H2\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion is a potent nucleophile. It reacts with the electrophilic 1,5-dibromopentane. Since there are two reactive sites on the dibromopentane and a sufficient amount of the carbanion, a double substitution occurs, connecting two ethyl cyanoacetate units via the five-carbon chain.\n        2 [NC-CHCOOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt) + 2 Br⁻\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate. Its structure is:\n    ```\n             CN   COOEt\n              |   /\n              CH-(CH2)5-CH\n                         |  \\\n                         CN  COOEt\n    ```\n    or more linearly: `(EtOOC)(CN)CH–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH(CN)(COOEt)`\n\n### Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in Product 4. The molecule has two chiral centers at the carbons bearing the cyano and ester groups. The reaction produces a mixture of diastereomers (a meso form and a d/l racemic pair). However, both the meso form (with a plane of symmetry) and the d/l pair (with a C2 axis of symmetry) will exhibit a high degree of symmetry, leading to the same number of signals. We can analyze either.\n\nLet's break down the structure and count the unique proton environments:\n\n`(CH3(a)CH2(b)OOC)(CN)CH(c)–CH2(d)–CH2(e)–CH2(f)–CH2(e)–CH2(d)–CH(c)(CN)(COOCH2(b)CH3(a))`\n\n1.  **Methyl Protons (-CH3), labeled (a):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent due to the molecule's overall symmetry. The three protons within each methyl group are also equivalent due to free rotation. This results in **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Methylene Protons of Ethyl Group (-OCH2-), labeled (b):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. In principle, the two protons on each methylene group are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. However, in many contexts, especially for groups slightly removed from the chiral center, this splitting is not resolved or is intentionally ignored in problems. Given the answer choices, we will assume they are treated as equivalent. This results in **1 signal**.\n\n3.  **Methine Protons (-CH(CN)-), labeled (c):** These are the protons on the two chiral centers. Due to the molecule's symmetry (either a plane or C2 axis), these two protons are chemically equivalent. This results in **1 signal**.\n\n4.  **Central Methylene Protons (-CH2-), labeled (f):** The five-carbon linker is `–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–`. The central CH2 group is unique. Its two protons are equivalent because they can be interchanged by the molecule's symmetry element (either residing on the plane of symmetry or being swapped by C2 rotation). This results in **1 signal**.\n\n5.  **Inner Methylene Protons, labeled (e):** These are the two CH2 groups adjacent to the central one. They are equivalent to each other by symmetry. However, within each group, the two protons are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule and cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation. Thus, they are chemically distinct and will produce two separate signals. This results in **2 signals**.\n\n6.  **Outer Methylene Protons, labeled (d):** These are the two CH2 groups adjacent to the chiral centers. They are equivalent to each other by symmetry. Similar to the protons at (e), the two protons within each of these methylene groups are diastereotopic (and this effect is often more pronounced due to proximity to the chiral center). They will give two distinct signals. This results in **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming up the signals from each unique environment:\n1 (from CH3) + 1 (from OCH2) + 1 (from CH) + 1 (from central CH2) + 2 (from inner CH2s) + 2 (from outer CH2s) = **8 signals**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
