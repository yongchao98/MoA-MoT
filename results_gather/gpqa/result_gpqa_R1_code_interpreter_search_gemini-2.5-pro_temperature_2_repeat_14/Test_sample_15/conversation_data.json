    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the optical activity of each compound. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the absence of a plane of symmetry (Ïƒ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure**: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, CH3, C from ethyl) lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex, bridged polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   **Analysis**: The designation `(3aR,7aS...)` indicates that the compound is a specific stereoisomer with defined configurations at its chiral centers (3a and 7a). When a compound is named as a single stereoisomer (with R/S descriptors), it is chiral unless it is a meso compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to internal symmetry. However, this molecule has a substituent, `(E)-8-(chloromethylene)` which is `-C=CHCl`, on the methano bridge. This substituent is unsymmetrical and is placed on the bridge, which destroys any potential plane of symmetry that might have existed in the parent bicyclic framework. Therefore, the molecule as a whole is asymmetric.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, and thus **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a classic example of a meso compound. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule that has a plane of symmetry when viewed in an eclipsed conformation (in a Fischer projection) or a center of inversion in its staggered anti-periplanar conformation. The optical rotation caused by the (2R) center is cancelled internally by the opposite rotation caused by the (3S) center.\n        ```\n           COOH\n            |\n        H---C(R)---CH3\n        ----------- (plane of symmetry)\n      CH3---C(S)---H\n            |\n           COOH\n        ```\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral (meso), and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This is a diastereomer of the compound above.\n    *   **Analysis**: The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The molecule is chiral, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable (2S,3S) isomer. These two form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, and thus **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with a double bond (C3-C4) and a hydroxyl group (at C1).\n    *   **Analysis**: The name explicitly designates it as the (R) enantiomer. Carbon C1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=, and -CH=CH-CH2-. The designation `(R)` specifies one of the two enantiomers, which is by definition chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, and thus **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Structure**: Cyclohexane with three OH groups at C1, C3, and C5, all on the same side of the ring (cis).\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule is highly symmetrical. In its stable chair conformation with all three OH groups in equatorial positions, the molecule possesses a C3 axis of rotation and three planes of symmetry (each plane passes through a C-OH group). The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. The `s` notation (instead of R/S) is often used to denote stereogenic centers in an achiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral, and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure**: `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Analysis**: Let's search for chiral centers (a carbon with four different groups). There are none. The carbon in the `-CH(CH3)2` group is attached to two identical methyl groups. While lack of a chiral center doesn't automatically mean achiral, this molecule does possess a plane of symmetry in an accessible conformation. This plane contains the ketone's C=O group, the CH2 group, and the CH of the isopropyl group, and it bisects both the cyclopentyl ring and the two methyls of the isopropyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral, and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\n\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are three compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
