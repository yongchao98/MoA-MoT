    "The user wants to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution.\n\n1.  **Define the system:** We have a central metal ion `Co(II)` and a ligand `SCN-`. They form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`.\n\n2.  **State the given information:**\n    *   Total Cobalt Concentration, `c(Co)` = `[Co^2+]_total` = 10^-2 M\n    *   Thiocyanate Concentration, `[SCN-]` = 0.1 M. Since the total cobalt concentration is 100 times smaller than the thiocyanate concentration, the formation of complexes will not significantly change the free thiocyanate concentration. Thus, we can approximate the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand `[SCN-]` as 0.1 M.\n    *   Overall stability constants:\n        *   `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]) = 9`\n        *   `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) = 40`\n        *   `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]-] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3) = 63`\n        *   `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4) = 16`\n\n3.  **Formulate the problem:** The goal is to calculate the percentage of `[Co(SCN)2]` relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction (`α2`) of the `[Co(SCN)2]` species and multiplying it by 100.\n\n    `Percentage of [Co(SCN)2] = ( [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co) ) * 100`\n\n4.  **Set up the equations:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free `Co^2+` and all its complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n    We can express the concentration of each complex using the stability constants:\n    `[[Co(SCN)_n]] = βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^n`\n\n    Substituting these into the total concentration equation:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1*[Co^2+]*[SCN-] + β2*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]^4`\n\n    Factoring out `[Co^2+]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the mole fraction (α2):**\n    The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)2]` species is:\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels, leaving an expression that only depends on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)`\n\n6.  **Perform the calculation:** We will substitute the given values into this formula. This can be done efficiently and accurately using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate each term in the denominator of the mole fraction equation\nterm0 = 1  # Represents free Co^2+\nterm1 = beta1 * scn_conc\nterm2 = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)  # Represents [Co(SCN)2]\nterm3 = beta3 * (scn_conc**3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (scn_conc**4)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms, which represents the ratio of total Co to free Co\ndenominator_sum = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator is the term for the species of interest, [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = term2\n\n# The mole fraction (alpha2) of the dithiocyanato complex\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator_sum\n\n# Convert the mole fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f'{percentage:.1f}')\n```\n<execute_result>\n16.9\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)2]` is 16.9%.

    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]`, denoted as `α2`, and expressing it as a percentage.\n\n**1. Define the species and equilibria**\nThe species containing cobalt in the solution are the free ion `Co^2+` and the complexes `[Co(SCN)]+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`.\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (βn):\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]+` ; `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)2]` ; `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)3]-` ; `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)4]^2-` ; `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16`\n\n**2. Formulate the mole fraction expression**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\nThe mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]`, `α2`, is given by:\n`α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free `[Co^2+]` ion, the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]`, and the stability constants:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the formula for `α2`:\n`α2 = (β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels, leaving an expression that depends only on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n`α2 = (β2[SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n**3. Perform the calculation**\nWe are given:\n*   Total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10^-2 M = 0.01 M`\n*   Total thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN-]_total = 0.1 M`\n*   Stability constants: `β1=9`, `β2=40`, `β3=63`, `β4=16`\n\nSince the total thiocyanate concentration (`0.1 M`) is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration (`0.01 M`), we can approximate that the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand `[SCN-]` is approximately equal to its total concentration.\n`[SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\nNow, we substitute the values into the equation for `α2`.\n\n*   **Calculate the numerator:**\n    Numerator = `β2 * [SCN-]^2` = `40 * (0.1)^2` = `40 * 0.01` = `0.4`\n\n*   **Calculate the terms in the denominator:**\n    *   Term 0 (`Co^2+`): `1`\n    *   Term 1 (`[Co(SCN)]+`): `β1 * [SCN-]` = `9 * 0.1` = `0.9`\n    *   Term 2 (`[Co(SCN)2]`): `β2 * [SCN-]^2` = `40 * (0.1)^2` = `0.4`\n    *   Term 3 (`[Co(SCN)3]-`): `β3 * [SCN-]^3` = `63 * (0.1)^3` = `63 * 0.001` = `0.063`\n    *   Term 4 (`[Co(SCN)4]^2-`): `β4 * [SCN-]^4` = `16 * (0.1)^4` = `16 * 0.0001` = `0.0016`\n\n*   **Sum the denominator:**\n    Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016` = `2.3646`\n\n*   **Calculate the mole fraction `α2`:**\n    `α2 = Numerator / Denominator` = `0.4 / 2.3646` ≈ `0.16916`\n\n*   **Convert to percentage:**\n    Percentage = `α2 * 100` = `0.16916 * 100` ≈ `16.9%`\n\nThus, the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
