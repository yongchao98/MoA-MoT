    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Model and Energy Levels**\n\nThe problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor) for a diatomic molecule. The total energy `E` of the molecule in a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J` is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\n`E(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot`\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy:** `E_vib = ħω(v + 1/2)`\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (`v = 0, 1, 2, ...`).\n\n*   **Rotational Energy:** `E_rot = (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)`\n    *   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n    *   `J` is the rotational quantum number (`J = 0, 1, 2, ...`).\n\nSo, the total energy is: `E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)`\n\n### **2. Identify the Initial State**\n\nThe molecule is in its **fundamental state** (or ground state). This is the state with the lowest possible energy, which corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers:\n*   `v = 0`\n*   `J = 0`\n\nThe energy of this initial state `E_i` is:\n`E_i = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω`\n\n### **3. Determine the Transition to the Next Lowest Energy State**\n\nAn absorbed photon causes the molecule to transition to a higher energy state. We need to find the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" In the context of ro-vibrational spectroscopy, transitions are governed by **selection rules**. For a diatomic molecule absorbing a photon, the standard selection rules are:\n*   `Δv = +1` (for absorption)\n*   `ΔJ = ±1`\n\nStarting from the ground state `(v=0, J=0)`, we apply these rules:\n*   `v` must change from 0 to 1 (`Δv = +1`).\n*   `J` must change by ±1. Since `J` cannot be negative, the only possibility is `ΔJ = +1`, meaning `J` changes from 0 to 1.\n\nTherefore, the final state `(v_f, J_f)` is `(1, 1)`. This is the lowest energy transition allowed from the ground state under the typical IR absorption selection rules.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Energy of the Transition (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the difference in energy between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **Initial Energy:** `E_i = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω`\n*   **Final Energy:** `E_f = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2(ħ² / 2I) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I`\n\nThe energy difference `ΔE` is:\n`ΔE = E_f - E_i = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n### **5. Calculate the Numerical Value of ΔE**\n\nTo find `ΔE`, we first need to calculate the moment of inertia, `I`.\n`I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass and `R` is the bond length.\n\n**a) Calculate Reduced Mass (μ):**\n`μ = (M_x * M_y) / (M_x + M_y)`\nGiven: `M_x = 20 amu`, `M_y = 2 amu`.\n`μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu`\nConvert amu to kg: `1 amu = 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n`μ = 1.818 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n\n**b) Calculate Moment of Inertia (I):**\nGiven: `R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n`I = μR² = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n**c) Calculate the two energy terms:**\n`ħω = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n`ħ²/I = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.209 x 10⁻²³ J`\n\n**d) Calculate Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n`ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I = (4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (0.009209 x 10⁻²⁰ J) = 4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n\n### **6. Calculate the Photon's Momentum**\n\nThe energy `E` of a photon is related to its momentum `p` by the equation `E = pc`, where `c` is the speed of light (`c ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s`).\n\nTherefore, the momentum of the absorbed photon is:\n`p = ΔE / c`\n`p = (4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.9979 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ J·s/m (or N·s)`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Constants ---\nh_bar = 1.05457e-34      # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\namu_to_kg = 1.66054e-27  # Conversion factor from amu to kg\nangstrom_to_m = 1e-10    # Conversion factor from angstrom to m\nc = 2.99792458e8         # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# --- Given Molecular Properties ---\nMx_amu = 20              # Mass of atom X in amu\nMy_amu = 2               # Mass of atom Y in amu\nR_angstrom = 2           # Bond length in angstroms\nomega = 4e14             # Angular frequency of vibration in rad/s\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate Reduced Mass in SI units ---\nmu = (Mx_amu * My_amu) / (Mx_amu + My_amu) * amu_to_kg\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate Moment of Inertia in SI units ---\nR_m = R_angstrom * angstrom_to_m\nI = mu * R_m**2\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the energy of the transition (v=0, J=0) -> (v=1, J=1) ---\n# This transition energy is Delta_E = h_bar*omega + h_bar^2/I\ndelta_E = (h_bar * omega) + (h_bar**2 / I)\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the momentum of the photon ---\n# p = E / c\np_photon = delta_E / c\n\nprint(f\"p = {p_photon:.2e} N*s\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**1. Identify the Model and Energy Levels**\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). The total energy `E(v, J)` of the molecule in a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J` is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n`E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * J(J + 1)`\nwhere:\n-   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (`0, 1, 2, ...`).\n-   `J` is the rotational quantum number (`0, 1, 2, ...`).\n-   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`).\n-   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n-   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n**2. Determine the Initial and Final States**\n-   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state\" (or ground state), which is the state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers, `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω`\n-   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" For ro-vibrational spectroscopy of a diatomic molecule, the selection rules for absorption are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`.\n    -   Starting from `v = 0`, the next vibrational level is `v = 1` (`Δv = +1`).\n    -   Starting from `J = 0`, the only possible change is to `J = 1` (`ΔJ = +1`), since `J` cannot be negative.\n    Therefore, the final state is `(v, J) = (1, 1)`.\n    `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2(ħ²/2I) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE)**\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n`ΔE = E_final - E_initial`\n`ΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]`\n`ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n**4. Calculate the Numerical Values of Physical Quantities**\nTo calculate `ΔE`, we first need to find the moment of inertia, `I`.\n-   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`\n    `μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu`\n    We need to convert this to kilograms: `1 amu = 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`.\n    `μ = 1.818... * 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n-   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    `I = μ * R²`\n    The bond length `R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`.\n\n**5. Perform the Full Calculation Using Python**\nTo ensure precision, we will use a Python script to calculate the values of `μ`, `I`, `ΔE`, and finally the photon momentum `p`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Constants ---\nh_bar = 1.05457e-34      # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\namu_to_kg = 1.66054e-27  # Conversion factor from amu to kg\nangstrom_to_m = 1e-10    # Conversion factor from angstrom to m\nc = 2.99792458e8         # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# --- Given Molecular Properties ---\nMx_amu = 20              # Mass of atom X in amu\nMy_amu = 2               # Mass of atom Y in amu\nR_angstrom = 2           # Bond length in angstroms\nomega = 4e14             # Angular frequency of vibration in rad/s\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate Reduced Mass in SI units ---\nmu_amu = (Mx_amu * My_amu) / (Mx_amu + My_amu)\nmu_kg = mu_amu * amu_to_kg\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate Moment of Inertia in SI units ---\nR_m = R_angstrom * angstrom_to_m\nI = mu_kg * R_m**2\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the energy of the transition (ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I) ---\ndelta_E = (h_bar * omega) + (h_bar**2 / I)\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the momentum of the photon using E = pc ---\np_photon = delta_E / c\n\nprint(f\"p = {p_photon:.3e} N*s\")\n```\n\nCode output: p = 1.410e-28 N*s\n\nErrors:\n\n**6. Relate Energy to Momentum and Finalize**\nThe energy of a photon `E` is related to its momentum `p` and the speed of light `c` by the formula `E = pc`. Therefore, the required momentum is `p = ΔE / c`.\nFrom the calculation performed by the Python script, `ΔE` is calculated and then divided by `c` to find the momentum `p`.\n\nThe result is `p = 1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) p = 1.4*10⁻²⁸ N*s\nB) p = 1.1*10⁻²⁷ N*s\nC) p = 2.3*10⁻²⁷ N*s\nD) p = 1.9*10⁻²⁸ N*s\n\nThe calculated value `1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
