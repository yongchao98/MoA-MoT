    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. The simplest and typically dominant form of radiation from such a source, unless forbidden by symmetry, is electric dipole radiation. We will model the oscillating spheroid as an oscillating electric dipole.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the angular dependence of the radiated power.**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\nwhere `θ` is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis in this case), and `C` is a factor that depends on the frequency of oscillation, the amplitude of the dipole moment, and fundamental constants.\n\nThe function `f(λ, θ)` represents this power per unit solid angle. So, we have:\n`f(λ, θ) = C(λ) * sin²(θ)`\n\nThe problem states that the maximum radiated power is `A`. The maximum value of the `sin²(θ)` term is 1, which occurs when `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\nSo, the maximum power is:\n`A = f_max = C(λ) * sin²(90°) = C(λ) * 1 = C(λ)`\n\nThis means we can write the radiated power as a function of the maximum power `A` and the angle `θ`:\n`f(θ) = A * sin²(θ)`\n\nWe need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We calculate the power at this angle:\n`f(30°) = A * sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`. Therefore:\n`f(30°) = A * (1/2)² = A * (1/4)`\n\nSo, the fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the wavelength dependence of the radiated power.**\n\nNow, let's look at the wavelength dependence of the function `f`. The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is strongly dependent on the frequency of oscillation. The full formula for the time-averaged power per unit solid angle is:\n`dP/dΩ = (μ₀ * p₀² * ω⁴) / (32 * π² * c) * sin²(θ)`\nHere, `ω` is the angular frequency of the oscillation. The power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πν = 2π(c/λ)`, where `c` is the speed of light and `ν` is the frequency.\nSubstituting this into the proportionality, we get:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴`\n\nSo, the power per unit solid angle, `f`, is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n`f ∝ λ⁻⁴`\nThis is a possible form for the function `f`. This is also the basis for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue (shorter wavelengths are scattered more effectively).\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results.**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n1.  The fraction of `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n2.  A possible form for the wavelength dependence of `f` is **`λ⁻⁴`**.\n\nCombining these two results, we get the pair (1/4, `λ⁻⁴`). This corresponds to option B."
