    "Here's a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n2.  **Understand the Chemical System:** The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, exists in equilibrium with its constituent ions. The relevant reaction is the dissociation of this complex:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Relate Formation and Dissociation Constants:** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$, also called stability constant) for the complex, which corresponds to the formation reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    To work with the dissociation reaction, we need the dissociation constant ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n4.  **Set up an Equilibrium Table (ICE Table):** We'll track the concentrations of the species from the initial state to the equilibrium state. Let 'x' be the change in concentration due to dissociation. The problem states we start with a 0.02 M solution of the stoichiometric complex.\n\n    | Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n    |---------------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|\n    | $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n    | $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n    | $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n    The term \"ideal pH\" implies that we can consider all free EDTA to be in the $EDTA^{4-}$ form, so we can use the given K value directly without pH correction (i.e., $\\alpha_{Y^{4-}} = 1$).\n\n5.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for the dissociation constant ($K_d$):\n    $K_d = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n6.  **Simplify and Solve for x:** The value of $K_d$ ($2 \\times 10^{-11}$) is extremely small. This indicates that the dissociation is very slight, and the equilibrium lies far to the left. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make a simplifying assumption:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    Now, the equation becomes:\n    $\\frac{x^2}{0.02} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n    Solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.02 \\times (2 \\times 10^{-11})$\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-11})$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Solve for x (which is the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$):\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the final value:** I will use a simple python script to calculate the square root accurately and avoid manual calculation errors.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nx_squared = 4 * (10**-13)\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\nprint(f\"The concentration of calcium ions is {x:.2e} M.\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nThe concentration of calcium ions is 6.32e-07 M.\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n8.  **Check the Assumption:** Was the simplification valid?\n    Is $x << 0.02$?\n    Is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7} << 0.02$? Yes, the value of x is several orders of magnitude smaller than 0.02, so the assumption was excellent.\n\n9.  **Compare with the Answer Choices:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions is $[Ca^{2+}] = x = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n    This value corresponds to option A.\n    A) 6.3x10^-7 M\n    B) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    C) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    D) 2.0x10^-2 M\n\nThe calculated result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution prepared by dissolving 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Write the relevant chemical reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, will dissociate into its constituent ions. The equilibrium reaction for dissociation is:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Determine the equilibrium constant:** The problem gives the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which is for the reverse reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations.

Therefore, x will be very small compared to 0.02. We can make the simplifying assumption that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n    Now, solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Solve for x, which is the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n    Since $\\sqrt{36} = 6$ and $\\sqrt{49} = 7$, $\\sqrt{40}$ is approximately 6.3.\n    $x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} M$\n\n5.  **Compare with the provided options:** The calculated concentration is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.
