    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Name:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Structure:** The name describes a substituted cyclohexene oxide.\n    *   `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is the IUPAC name for cyclohexene oxide, where the epoxide oxygen is numbered as atom 7, and it bridges carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups on carbons C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` defines the absolute stereochemistry at these four chiral centers.\n*   **Key Feature:** The epoxide ring (C1-O-C6) is cis-fused to the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me2CuLi, known as lithium dimethylcuprate or a Gilman reagent.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Nucleophile:** The reagent provides a methyl nucleophile (CH3-), which is considered a \"soft\" nucleophile.\n*   **Reaction Rules:** The problem states two key rules for the reaction of epoxides with organocuprates:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack follows an SN2 mechanism, resulting in an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The nucleophilic attack can occur at either C1 or C6 of the epoxide ring.\n*   We need to compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to the epoxide oxygen (O7), another ring carbon (C2), the other bridgehead carbon (C6), and a methyl group. This makes C1 a **quaternary carbon** (or a highly substituted tertiary carbon within the ring system).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to the epoxide oxygen (O7), another ring carbon (C5), the other bridgehead carbon (C1), and a hydrogen atom. This makes C6 a **tertiary carbon**.\n*   Comparing a quaternary carbon (C1) to a tertiary carbon (C6), the tertiary carbon **C6 is significantly less sterically hindered**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The methyl nucleophile from Me2CuLi will attack C6.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Connectivity**\n\n*   The attack of the methyl group (Me) on C6 breaks the C6-O bond.\n*   The C1-O bond remains intact initially, forming an alkoxide at C1.\n*   A subsequent workup step (usually with a mild acid like NH4Cl or H3O+) protonates the alkoxide to give a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexane ring with:\n    *   An -OH group and a -CH3 group on C1 (from the original structure).\n    *   A new -CH3 group on C6 (from the nucleophilic attack).\n    *   A -CH3 group on C3 (from the original structure).\n    *   A -CH3 group on C4 (from the original structure).\n*   **Naming the Product:** The principal functional group is the hydroxyl group, so it is a cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the -OH group is numbered C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible locants, we number the ring towards the old C6.\n    *   C1(product) = C1(reactant) -> has OH, Me\n    *   C2(product) = C6(reactant) -> has new Me\n    *   C4(product) = C4(reactant) -> has Me\n    *   C5(product) = C3(reactant) -> has Me\n*   The IUPAC name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n**5. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\n*   We need to find the configuration at the four stereocenters of the product: C1, C2, C4, and C5.\n*   **Center C2 (from reactant C6):** The reaction is an SN2 attack at C6, causing an **inversion of configuration**.\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n    *   Inversion of (S) gives **(R)**.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C2 of the product is **(2R)**.\n*   **Comparing Options:**\n    *   Option A is (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-...\n    *   Option D is (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-...\n*   Based on the inversion at the site of attack, the product must have a (2R) configuration. This alone points to **Option D** as the correct answer.\n\n**6. Confirmation of Other Stereocenters (Optional but good practice)**\n\n*   **C1, C4, C5:** These centers are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-making steps of the reaction. Their absolute spatial arrangement of substituents is preserved. We need to check if the R/S designation remains the same after the molecule's structure has changed.\n    *   **C1:** The configuration was **(1R)**. The attached groups and their priorities relative to each other's spatial positions do not change in a way that flips the designation. It remains **(1R)**.\n    *   **C4:** The configuration was **(4R)**. The chiral center's geometry is unchanged. It remains **(4R)** in the product.\n    *   **C5 (from reactant C3):** The configuration was **(3R)**. The center's geometry is preserved. It becomes C5 in the product name and remains **(R)**. So it is **(5R)**.\n*   **Final Product Stereochemistry:** The combined analysis confirms the product's configuration is **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction is a regioselective and stereoselective SN2 opening of the epoxide. The methyl nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon (C6), causing an inversion of configuration at that center from (6S) to (2R). The other stereocenters (1R, 3R -> 5R, 4R -> 4R) retain their configuration.\n\nTherefore, the final product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>"
