    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The problem describes a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles confined within a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. We need to find the total energy of this system for its ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    For a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are quantized and given by the formula:\n    E_n = n^2 * (h_bar^2 * pi^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\n    where 'n' is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), 'm' is the mass of the particle, and 'h_bar' is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n    The problem helpfully defines a base energy unit E = (h_bar^2 * pi^2) / (2 * m * L^2).\n    So, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n    E_n = n^2 * E\n\n    Let's list the first few single-particle energy levels:\n    *   n = 1: E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n    *   n = 2: E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n    *   n = 3: E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n    *   n = 4: E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n    *   n = 5: E_5 = 5^2 * E = 25E\n    *   and so on.\n\n3.  **Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n    The particles are described as \"identical spin-1/2 particles\". This means they are **fermions**. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n\n    The state of a particle in this well is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number 'n' (which determines the spatial part of the wavefunction and the energy) and the spin magnetic quantum number 'm_s'. For a spin-1/2 particle, 'm_s' can be +1/2 (spin up, ↑) or -1/2 (spin down, ↓).\n\n    Therefore, for each energy level E_n (defined by 'n'), there are two distinct quantum states: one with spin up and one with spin down. This means each energy level `E_n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    The ground state is the state of the lowest possible total energy. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the lowest upwards with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n    *   **Level n=1 (E_1 = 1E):** Can hold two particles. We place the first two particles here.\n        *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * E_1 = 2 * (1E) = 2E.\n    *   **Level n=2 (E_2 = 4E):** Can hold two particles. We place the remaining two particles here.\n        *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n\n    The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n    E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n    *   Ground State Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited):**\n    The first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest possible energy. It is typically formed by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2.\n    *   The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n    *   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n\n    The new configuration for the first excited state is:\n    *   Level n=1: Two particles. Energy = 2 * E_1 = 2E.\n    *   Level n=2: One particle. Energy = 1 * E_2 = 4E.\n    *   Level n=3: One particle. Energy = 1 * E_3 = 9E.\n\n    The total energy of the first excited state is:\n    E_1st_excited = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible low-energy promotions from the ground state.\n\n    Let's list the possible states and their energies in increasing order:\n    *   **Ground State:** {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2}. Energy = 10E.\n    *   **Excitation A (already found):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n        *   Energy = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2 + 4 + 9 = 15E. (This is the First Excited State).\n    *   **Excitation B:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n        *   Energy = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1 + 8 + 9 = **18E**.\n    *   **Excitation C:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: {2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3}.\n        *   Energy = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2 + 18 = 20E.\n    *   **Excitation D:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n        *   Configuration: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n        *   Energy = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2 + 4 + 16 = 22E.\n\n    Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E,...), the lowest is 15E, which corresponds to the first excited state. The next lowest is 18E.\n\n    Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n7.  **Final Summary:**\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
