    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n1.  **Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n    The general solutions for the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` in terms of charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are given by the retarded potentials, which account for the finite speed of light, `c`.\n    \n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d\\tau'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d\\tau'$\n\n    Here:\n    *   $\\vec{r}$ is the observation point (field point).\n    *   $\\vec{r'}$ is the source point.\n    *   $t_r$ is the retarded time, defined by $t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}{c}$. This is the time at which the field observed at time `t` must have been emitted from the source.\n    *   $d\\tau'$ is the volume element of the source.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a single point charge `q` with trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    \n    *   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t) = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t))$\n    *   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t) = q \\vec{v}(t) \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t))$, where $\\vec{v}(t) = \\dfrac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals**\n    Let's substitute these densities into the potential integrals. The delta function simplifies the integration over the volume `dτ'`.\n    \n    Let's first consider the scalar potential `V`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d\\tau'$\n\n    The delta function is evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. This is the tricky part. The retarded time `tr` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. We have $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c$.\n    \n    A standard result from electrodynamics for evaluating this integral is that the retardation introduces a correction factor in the denominator. The derivation involves a change of variables and accounts for the \"compression\" or \"stretching\" of the volume element due to the source's motion (a Doppler-like effect).\n\n    The result of this integration is the Liénard-Wiechert potential:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    And similarly for the vector potential:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    Where:\n    *   The notation `[... ]_tr` means all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ is the distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is determined by the equation $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n4.  **Matching with the Options**\n    Let's rewrite the denominators to match the form in the given options.\n    \n    For `V(r,t)`:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    Multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    This matches the expression for `V` in option B.\n\n    For `A(r,t)`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    Multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    This matches the expression for `A` in option B.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The expressions in option B are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n    \n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n    It is also worth noting that there is a direct relationship between these potentials:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi \\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{1}{c^2} \\vec{v} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    \n    This relationship confirms the consistency of the expressions in option B. The other options are incorrect. Option A uses an overly simplified potential, Option C has an incorrect relationship for A, and Option D has the wrong sign in the denominator.\n\n<<<B>>>"
