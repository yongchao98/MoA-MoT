    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the expression:** The given expression is a \"size estimate\" for a quantity calculated from a Feynman diagram.\n    `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n    This expression can be broken down into several parts:\n    *   `alpha^3 * g^2`: Factors from coupling constants at the vertices of the diagram.\n    *   `sqrt(2) * 8`: Numerical factors that can arise from symmetry, traces over matrices (like Dirac gamma matrices), or group theory factors.\n    *   `(Q/M)^2`: A dimensionless ratio of energy scales or masses, which typically results from the evaluation of integrals.\n    *   `1/(4pi)^6`: A factor containing `π`. In quantum field theory, powers of `π` in the denominator are a tell-tale sign of loop calculations. This term is the key to solving the problem.\n\n2.  **Recall the origin of loop factors:** In Quantum Field Theory (QFT), calculating a Feynman diagram with loops involves integrating over the momenta of the virtual particles running in the loops. For each loop in a diagram, we have one integral over a four-dimensional loop momentum `k`. In `d` spacetime dimensions, this is written as:\n    `∫ d^d k / (2π)^d`\n\n3.  **Evaluate the loop factor:** When this integral is performed (typically using techniques like Feynman parametrization and dimensional regularization), the integration over the angular components in `d=4` dimensions results in a standard factor. Let's quickly see how this comes about.\n    The integration measure `d^4k` in Euclidean space becomes `dΩ_4 * k^3 dk`. The solid angle in 4 dimensions is `2π^2`. Dividing by the `(2π)^4` from the integration measure gives `2π^2 / (16π^4) = 1/(8π^2)`. Along with other factors from the radial integral, the canonical result for one loop integral in a typical amplitude calculation is a suppression factor of `1/(16π^2)`.\n\n4.  **Establish the rule for L loops:** Based on the above, a key rule of thumb in QFT is that each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of `1/(16π^2)` to the amplitude of the process.\n    *   For a 1-loop diagram, the factor is `1/(16π^2)`.\n    *   For a 2-loop diagram, the factor is `(1/(16π^2))^2`.\n    *   For an `L`-loop diagram, the factor is `(1/(16π^2))^L`.\n\n5.  **Connect the general rule to the given expression:** The expression in the note has a factor of `1/(4pi)^6`. We need to find the number of loops, `L`, that would produce this factor. We set up the equation:\n    `(1/(16π^2))^L = 1/(4pi)^6`\n\n6.  **Solve for L:** To solve for `L`, we can rewrite the terms to have a common base. Notice that `16 = 4^2`.\n    So, `16π^2 = (4^2) * π^2 = (4π)^2`.\n    Now substitute this back into the equation:\n    `(1/((4π)^2))^L = 1/(4π)^6`\n    `1/(4π)^(2L) = 1/(4π)^6`\n\n7.  By comparing the exponents in the denominator, we get:\n    `2L = 6`\n    `L = 3`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculation implies that the Feynman diagram had 3 loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
