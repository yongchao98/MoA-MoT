    "**1. Deciphering the Starting Material (C8H9NO) from NMR Data**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula is C8H9NO. The DoU is calculated as C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5. A DoU of 5 strongly indicates the presence of a benzene ring (4 DoU) and one other double bond or ring (1 DoU). The signals in the aromatic region (6-7 ppm) confirm the benzene ring.\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, suggesting a -CH2-CHO group.\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are in the aromatic region. This pattern is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons. Its chemical shift suggests it's a benzylic -CH2- group (a CH2 attached to the benzene ring). The doublet multiplicity means it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as this CH2 is coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amine group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2-CHO).\n    *   Let's check the formula: C6H4 (from the ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (from the side chain) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n    *   The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The chemical shifts also align: the electron-donating -NH2 group shields the ortho protons (6.51 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing -CH2CHO group deshields its ortho protons (6.98 ppm).\n\n**2. Analyzing the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde (H2N-C6H4-CH2-CHO)\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    *   This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   First, the reaction with NaNO2 and HCl at low temperature (diazotization) converts the -NH2 group into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        *   `H2N-C6H4-CH2-CHO -> [Cl-][+N2]-C6H4-CH2-CHO`\n    *   Second, warming the diazonium salt solution with water (hydrolysis) replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        *   `[+N2]-C6H4-CH2-CHO -> HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO`\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves treating the intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat.\n    *   4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group).\n    *   This is the classic condition for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an alpha-proton to form an enolate ion.\n        2.  **Aldol Addition:** The nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms an aldol addition product.\n            *   Adduct: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (This corresponds to option C).\n        3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct. The alpha-proton is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the beta-carbon leaves. This results in the formation of a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons.\n            *   `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO -> HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO + H2O`\n            *   The formation of this α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is thermodynamically favored because the new double bond is in conjugation with both the aldehyde's carbonyl group and one of the phenyl rings, creating a large, stable conjugated system.\n\n*   **Identifying the Final Product:**\n    *   The dehydrated product is named by identifying the main chain, which is a butenal (a four-carbon aldehyde with a double bond).\n    *   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a but-2-enal.\n    *   There are two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups, one on C2 and one on C4.\n    *   Therefore, the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option B. Option C is the intermediate before the final dehydration step, which occurs due to the applied heat.\n\n<<<B>>>"
