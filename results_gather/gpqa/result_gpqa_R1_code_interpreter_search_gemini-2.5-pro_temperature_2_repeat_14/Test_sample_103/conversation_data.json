    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n\n    *   **Goal:** Find the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets, T₂ / T₁.\n    *   **Given Information:**\n        *   Star masses are equal: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n        *   Planet masses are equal: M_p₁ = M_p₂.\n        *   Detection method: Radial Velocity (RV).\n        *   The RV manifests as a periodic wavelength shift (Doppler shift).\n        *   Shift amplitude for Planet 1 system: Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ.\n        *   Shift amplitude for Planet 2 system: Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ.\n        *   Orbits are circular.\n\n2.  **Relate Observations to Physical Quantities:**\n\n    *   The radial velocity method relies on the Doppler effect. The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight: Δλ ∝ v_r.\n    *   The problem gives the *amplitude* of the periodic shift (e.g., \"up to 5 miliangstrom\"). This corresponds to the *amplitude* of the star's radial velocity, denoted by K.\n    *   Therefore, K ∝ Δλ.\n    *   We can write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n        K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 mÅ / 5 mÅ = 1.4.\n\n3.  **Find the Relevant Physics Formula:**\n\n    *   We need an equation that connects the radial velocity amplitude (K) to the orbital period (T) and the masses of the star and planet.\n    *   The standard formula for the RV amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n        K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n        where:\n        *   T is the orbital period.\n        *   G is the gravitational constant.\n        *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n        *   M_star is the star's mass.\n        *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight (i=90° is an edge-on orbit).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Relationship between K and T:**\n\n    *   Let's look at the formula and see what's constant and what's changing between the two systems.\n        K ∝ T^(-1/3) * M_p * M_star^(-2/3) * sin(i)\n    *   The problem states M_p₁ = M_p₂ and M_star₁ = M_star₂. So, the mass terms are the same for both systems.\n    *   The problem does not mention the orbital inclination `i`. In such problems, it's a standard simplifying assumption that either the inclination is the same for both systems (sin(i₁) = sin(i₂)) or that the effect of inclination is already factored out or irrelevant to the ratio. Without this assumption, the problem is unsolvable. Let's proceed with sin(i₁) = sin(i₂).\n    *   With these simplifications, the relationship becomes purely a proportionality between K and T:\n        K ∝ T^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio Equation:**\n\n    *   Using the proportionality, we can write a ratio for the two systems:\n        K₂ / K₁ = (T₂)^(-1/3) / (T₁)^(-1/3)\n    *   This can be rewritten as:\n        K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)^(-1/3)\n    *   Which is also the same as:\n        K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Solve for the desired ratio (T₂ / T₁):**\n\n    *   Substitute the known value of K₂ / K₁ = 1.4 into the equation:\n        1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n    *   To isolate the period ratio, cube both sides of the equation:\n        (1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂\n    *   The question asks for T₂ / T₁, so we need to take the reciprocal:\n        T₂ / T₁ = 1 / (1.4)³\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n\n    *   Now, compute the numerical value. I will use the code interpreter for precision.\n    *   Calculation: T₂ / T₁ = 1 / (1.4 * 1.4 * 1.4) = 1 / 2.744.\n```python\nprint(1 / (1.4**3))\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation gives approximately 0.364. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The radial velocity (RV) method measures the periodic shift in a star's spectral lines due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The amplitude of this wavelength shift, Δλ, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, K.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the stars' radial velocity amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 mÅ / 5 mÅ = 1.4\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit, assuming we are observing edge-on (sin(i) = 1, which is a common simplification for such problems), is given by:\n\nK = ( (2πG) / T )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   T is the orbital period\n*   G is the gravitational constant\n*   M_p is the planet's mass\n*   M_star is the star's mass\n\nThe problem states that the star masses are identical (M_star₁ = M_star₂) and the planet masses are similar (M_p₁ = M_p₂). All other terms in the equation, except for K and T, are either constants or are the same for both systems.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\nK ∝ T^(-1/3)\n\nWe can express this as a ratio for our two systems:\nK₂ / K₁ = (T₂)^(-1/3) / (T₁)^(-1/3)\nK₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\nWe already calculated that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. Substituting this value into the equation:\n1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n(1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂\n2.744 = T₁ / T₂\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio T₂ / T₁. We need to take the reciprocal of our result:\nT₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<D>>>"
