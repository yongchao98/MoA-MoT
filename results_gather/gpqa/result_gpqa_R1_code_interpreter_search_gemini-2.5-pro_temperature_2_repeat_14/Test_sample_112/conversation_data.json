    "*   **Analysis of FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically that of a carboxylic acid (which is often around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   The combination of the broad O-H and the C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens (hydrogens attached to a C=C bond) confirms the presence of an alkene functional group in the molecule.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group itself, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass calculation: Carbon (≈12) + Oxygen (≈16) + Oxygen (≈16) + Hydrogen (≈1) = 45.\n\n*   **Combining the Evidence and Evaluating Options:**\n    1.  The evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group is overwhelming. A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen.\n    2.  We are left with two possibilities: B) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2.\n    3.  To distinguish between these two, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each formula and compare it to the unsaturation indicated by the functional groups. The formula for DoU is `C - H/2 + 1` for a compound containing only C, H, and O.\n    4.  From the spectroscopic data, we know there are two sources of unsaturation:\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid).\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene).\n        *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\n    5.  Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   For **B) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. This formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (or an ester). It does not account for the C=C double bond.\n        *   For **D) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the presence of one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the molecular formula C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
