    "**Detailed analysis:**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. Chirality typically arises from the absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl system. Biphenyls consist of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In this molecule, all four positions *ortho* to the connecting single bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with bulky groups (nitro -NO₂ and dimethyl carboxylate -COOCH₃).\n    *   **Chirality:** The bulky groups at the ortho positions prevent the two phenyl rings from becoming co-planar due to steric hindrance. This locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. Because of the substitution pattern, this twisted conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The molecule is therefore chiral, and its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of stereoisomerism arising from hindered rotation is called **atropisomerism**. Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure:** The structure can be written as CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** We need to look for chiral centers. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        4.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule as a whole chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. It consists of a carbonyl group attached to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** This molecule is symmetric. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. It is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of the dimethyl ester of butenedioic acid (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃). The two ester groups (-COOCH₃) are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral and not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Compound **1** is optically active due to atropisomerism.\n*   Compound **2** is optically active due to a chiral center.\n*   Compound **3** is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.\n*   Compound **4** is achiral due to a center of inversion and being planar.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
