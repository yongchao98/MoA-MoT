    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Radius**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the amount of energy it absorbs from its host star. The formula is:\n\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (which is the orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\nFor any two planets (let's say Planet X and Planet Y) orbiting the *same star*, `T_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem also states that the albedo `A` is the same for all three planets. Therefore, all terms except `a` can be treated as a constant factor.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to: `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n\nFrom this, we can establish a ratio:\n`T_X / T_Y = (a_X / a_Y)^(-1/2) = (a_Y / a_X)^(1/2)`\n\nBy squaring both sides, we can find the ratio of the orbital radii:\n`a_Y / a_X = (T_X / T_Y)^2`\n\n**2. Understand the Relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Radius**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a):\n\n`P^2 ∝ a^3`\n\nFor two planets orbiting the same star, we can write this as a ratio:\n`(P_Y / P_X)^2 = (a_Y / a_X)^3`\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n`P_Y / P_X = (a_Y / a_X)^(3/2)`\n\n**3. Combine the two relationships**\n\nNow we can combine the equations from Step 1 and Step 2 to find a direct relationship between orbital period and equilibrium temperature.\n\nWe start with the period ratio from Step 2:\n`P_Y / P_X = (a_Y / a_X)^(3/2)`\n\nAnd we substitute the expression for `a_Y / a_X` from Step 1:\n`P_Y / P_X = [ (T_X / T_Y)^2 ]^(3/2)`\n\nThis simplifies to:\n`P_Y / P_X = (T_X / T_Y)^3`\n\nThis crucial formula tells us that the ratio of the orbital periods is equal to the cube of the *inverse* ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. The information about the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method is not needed for this calculation and can be disregarded.\n\n**4. Apply the Formula and Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nWe need to find the ratio `P3 / P1`. Using the formula we derived:\n\n`P3 / P1 = (T1 / T3)^3`\n\nWe are given the temperature ratios:\n*   `T1 / T2 = 1.4`\n*   `T2 / T3 = 2.3`\n\nWe can find the ratio `T1 / T3` by multiplying these two ratios:\n`T1 / T3 = (T1 / T2) * (T2 / T3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into our period ratio formula:\n`P3 / P1 = (3.22)^3`\n\nTo get the precise numerical value, we can use a simple calculation.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet 1 to Planet 3\nT1_over_T3 = 1.4 * 2.3\n\n# The ratio of the orbital period of Planet 3 to Planet 1 is the cube of the T1/T3 ratio.\nP3_over_P1 = T1_over_T3**3\n\nprint(P3_over_P1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n33.386248000000005\n</execute_result>\nThe result is approximately 33.39. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 10.4\nD) ~ 33.4\n\nThe calculated value of ~33.4 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature `T_eq` of a planet is related to its distance `a` from the star by the formula:\n`T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n\nThis means that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet X and Planet Y) orbiting the same star is:\n`T_X / T_Y = (a_Y / a_X)^(1/2)`\n\nSquaring both sides gives the ratio of their orbital radii:\n`a_Y / a_X = (T_X / T_Y)^2`\n\nKepler's Third Law relates the orbital period `P` to the orbital radius `a`:\n`P^2 ∝ a^3`\n\nFor two planets, the ratio of their periods is:\n`(P_Y / P_X)^2 = (a_Y / a_X)^3`\n`P_Y / P_X = (a_Y / a_X)^(3/2)`\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for the radius ratio into the period ratio equation:\n`P_Y / P_X = [ (T_X / T_Y)^2 ]^(3/2) = (T_X / T_Y)^3`\n\nThis is the key relationship: the ratio of the orbital periods is the cube of the inverse ratio of the equilibrium temperatures. The information about the planet masses, the albedo value, and the TTV method are not needed for this calculation, as the albedo cancels out in the ratio.\n\nWe are given:\n`T1 / T2 = 1.4`\n`T2 / T3 = 2.3`\n\nWe need to find the ratio `P3 / P1`. Using the formula we derived:\n`P3 / P1 = (T1 / T3)^3`\n\nFirst, let's find `T1 / T3` by multiplying the given ratios:\n`T1 / T3 = (T1 / T2) * (T2 / T3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n\nNow, substitute this value back into the period ratio equation:\n`P3 / P1 = (3.22)^3 ≈ 33.386`\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 10.4\nD) ~ 33.4\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
