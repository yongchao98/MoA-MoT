    "This problem asks us to identify which of the four given mutations is most likely to result in the complete inactivation of a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to find the mutation that causes the most severe disruption to the protein-building process.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:**\n    The sequence begins with `5’-ATG...`. In molecular biology, `ATG` is the standard start codon, which signals the beginning of protein translation and codes for the amino acid Methionine. The protein is translated codon by codon (in groups of three DNA bases) until a stop codon (`TGA`, `TAA`, or `TAG`) is reached. The intact gene ends with a `TGA` stop codon.\n\n    *   Intact Gene's first few codons and amino acids:\n        `ATG TTT CTC GCT ...` -> Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - ...\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Mutation's Impact:**\n    We need to determine the type of mutation in each case and assess how severely it would affect the final protein product. The most effective mutations for knocking out a gene's function are those that cause a **nonsense mutation** (introducing a premature stop codon) or a **frameshift mutation** (inserting or deleting a number of bases not divisible by three, which scrambles the entire downstream amino acid sequence).\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Intact:   `ATGTTTCTC...` -> `ATG TTT CTC...` (Met-Phe-Leu)\n        *   Mutant 1: `ATGTTCTAC...` -> `ATG TTC TAC...` (Met-Phe-Tyr)\n        *   The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a *silent* mutation.\n        *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a *missense* mutation, as it changes one amino acid to another. A single amino acid change might inactivate the protein, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Intact:   `ATGTTTCTC...` -> `ATG TTT CTC...` (Met-Phe-Leu)\n        *   Mutant 2: `ATGTTCTAAG...` -> `ATG TTC TAA...` (Met-Phe-STOP)\n        *   The second codon `TTT` (Phe) becomes `TTC` (Phe) - a silent change.\n        *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAA`. **`TAA` is a stop codon.** This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   This mutation will cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely. The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A protein from a gene with five exons will be much longer, so this truncation will almost certainly result in a completely non-functional product.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Intact:   `ATGTTTCTCGCT...`\n        *   Mutant 3: `ATGTTTTACGCT...`\n        *   Comparing the sequences, we see an extra `T` inserted after the first six bases (`ATGTTT`).\n        *   Intact frame:   `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n        *   Mutant frame: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT...` Wait, the string in the prompt is `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...`. Let's assume an insertion: `ATG TTT` followed by the new `T`.\n        *   New reading frame: `ATG TTT T AC G CTG GTG...` -> `Met Phe Tyr Ala Gly Val...`. The sequence of amino acids is scrambled from the point of insertion.\n        *   This is a **frameshift mutation**. Like a nonsense mutation, a frameshift is a severe mutation that is highly likely to lead to a non-functional protein, often by creating a downstream stop codon by chance.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Intact:   `...GCT GGT ACT...` (Ala-Gly-Thr)\n        *   Mutant 4: By comparing `ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...` with `ATGTTTTACGCTACT...` we can infer a deletion of `GGT`. (Note: The start of the mutant sequence has other changes, but the most significant is a deletion).\n        *   A deletion of `GGT` removes three bases, which corresponds to exactly one codon (for the amino acid Glycine). This is an **in-frame deletion**. It removes an amino acid but does not shift the reading frame for the rest of the protein. While this could be disruptive, it's generally less severe than a frameshift or nonsense mutation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth Mutant 2 (nonsense) and Mutant 3 (frameshift) would be highly effective at eliminating the gene's function. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is unambiguous and creates a stop codon at the very beginning of the protein (the 3rd codon). This is the most certain way, among the given options, to ensure a non-functional protein is produced, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
