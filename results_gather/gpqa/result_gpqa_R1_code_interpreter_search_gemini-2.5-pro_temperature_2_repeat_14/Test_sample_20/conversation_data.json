    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A)**\n\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers, known as tautomers. A very common type is **keto-enol tautomerism**, which involves the migration of a proton and the shifting of a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, a molecule must typically possess a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen on an sp3 hybridized carbon).\n\n    2.  **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone)**:\n        *   Structure: It is a cyclic diketone with the formula C₆H₄O₂. The ring contains two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups opposite each other.\n        *   α-hydrogens: The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl carbons are themselves part of C=C double bonds. They are sp2 hybridized and do not have the typical sp3 alpha-hydrogens required for simple keto-enol tautomerization. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n        *   Structure: It is a six-membered ring containing three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n        *   α-hydrogens: The hydrogens on carbons 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. In fact, each of these CH₂ groups is flanked by two carbonyl groups, making their hydrogens particularly acidic and easily removable.\n        *   This compound can readily undergo tautomerization. It exists in equilibrium with its enol form, **1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol)**. Due to the high stability of the aromatic ring in phloroglucinol, the equilibrium overwhelmingly favors this enol tautomer. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione strongly exhibits tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B)**\n\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n        *   Structure: The formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Chiral Center: Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n            1.  -H (hydrogen)\n            2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n            3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n            4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n        *   Since the carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will therefore exhibit optical isomerism (it has two non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers).\n\n    3.  **Dimethyl fumarate**:\n        *   Structure: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. It has a trans C=C double bond, with a -COOCH₃ group on each carbon of the double bond. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (trans).\n        *   Chirality: The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry that contains all the atoms, as well as a center of inversion. Due to these elements of symmetry, the molecule is achiral. An achiral molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism): **Benzoquinone**\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism): **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n    This combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
