    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe goal is to calculate the uncertainty, $\\Delta P_z$, of the operator $P_z$ for a system in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n**2. Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:**\nThe uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined by the standard deviation:\n$(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\nTherefore, for our operator $P_z$, the formula is:\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\nTo find $\\Delta P_z$, we need to calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, which is $\\langle P_z \\rangle$, and the expectation value of $P_z^2$, which is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.\n\n**3. Define the Given Operators and State:**\nFrom the problem description, we have:\nThe matrix for the operator $P_z$:\n$P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe state of the system is given by the column vector (ket) $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe corresponding row vector (bra) $\\langle\\psi|$ is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all elements are real, it's just the transpose:\n$\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| P_z |\\psi\\rangle$.\nFirst, let's calculate the result of applying the operator $P_z$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\cdot (-1/2) + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 \\cdot (1/\\sqrt{2}) + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 - 1 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we multiply this result by the bra $\\langle\\psi|$ from the left:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(0) + (-\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}) \\right) = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 0$\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n**5. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\nFirst, we need to find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$.\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_z^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\cdot1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0\\cdot0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)(-1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle$.\nFirst, apply $P_z^2$ to $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, multiply by the bra $\\langle\\psi|$ from the left:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(0) + (-\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{1}{2}) \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{2}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\nNow we substitute the calculated values back into the uncertainty formula:\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\nTo find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$, we take the square root:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nTo confirm this, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set hbar = 1 for calculation simplicity\nhbar = 1\n\n# Define the P_z operator matrix\nPz = hbar * np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]])\n\n# Define the state vector |psi>\npsi = np.array([[-1/2], [1/np.sqrt(2)], [-1/2]])\n\n# Calculate the conjugate transpose of |psi> to get <psi|\npsi_dagger = psi.conj().T\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz: <Pz>\nexp_Pz = psi_dagger @ Pz @ psi\nexp_Pz_val = exp_Pz[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the Pz^2 operator\nPz_squared = Pz @ Pz\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz^2: <Pz^2>\nexp_Pz_squared = psi_dagger @ Pz_squared @ psi\nexp_Pz_squared_val = exp_Pz_squared[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the variance: (<Pz^2> - <Pz>^2)\nvariance = exp_Pz_squared_val - (exp_Pz_val)**2\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty (standard deviation)\nuncertainty = np.sqrt(variance)\n\n# Print the final result in terms of hbar\nprint(f\"The uncertainty Delta Pz is: {uncertainty} * hbar\")\nprint(f\"This is equal to hbar/sqrt(2). hbar/sqrt(2) is approximately {1/np.sqrt(2):.3f} * hbar\")\n```\n>>>\nThe uncertainty Delta Pz is: 0.7071067811865476 * hbar\nThis is equal to hbar/sqrt(2). hbar/sqrt(2) is approximately 0.707 * hbar\n\nThe calculation yields $\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The uncertainty of an operator A is defined as $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$.\nFirst, we write down the matrix for the operator $P_z$ and the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ based on the problem description:\n\n$P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe state vector is given by:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe corresponding bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$ is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we need to calculate two quantities: the expectation value of $P_z$, denoted as $\\langle P_z \\rangle$, and the expectation value of $P_z^2$, denoted as $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.\n\n**1.
