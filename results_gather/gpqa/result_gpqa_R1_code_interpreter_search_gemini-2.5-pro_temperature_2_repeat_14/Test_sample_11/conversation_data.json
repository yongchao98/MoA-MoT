    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Principles:** This is a particle decay problem. The key principles to use are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Define Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** A positive pion (${\\pi}^{+}$) is at rest.\n        *   Initial Momentum ($p_i$): Since it's at rest, $p_i = 0$.\n        *   Initial Energy ($E_i$): Since it's at rest, its total energy is its rest energy, $E_i = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n    *   **Final State:** The pion decays into a positive muon (${\\mu}^{+}$) and a muon neutrino (${\\nu}_{\\mu}$).\n        *   Final Particles: ${\\mu}^{+}$ and ${\\nu}_{\\mu}$.\n        *   Final Momentum ($p_f$): $p_f = p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu}$.\n        *   Final Energy ($E_f$): $E_f = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   $p_i = p_f$\n    *   $0 = \\vec{p_{\\mu}} + \\vec{p_{\\nu}}$\n    *   This means the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n    *   $|\\vec{p_{\\mu}}| = |\\vec{p_{\\nu}}| = p$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_i = E_f$\n    *   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    *   We need to express the final energies in terms of momentum using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass.\n        *   For the muon (${\\mu}^{+}$): $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n        *   For the neutrino (${\\nu}_{\\mu}$): Neutrinos have a very tiny mass, so we can approximate it as massless ($m_{\\nu} = 0$). For a massless particle, the energy is $E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n5.  **Set up the Equation to Solve for Momentum (p):**\n    *   Substitute the energy expressions back into the energy conservation equation:\n        $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `pc`:\n        $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n        $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    *   The $(pc)^2$ terms cancel out:\n        $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    *   Isolate the `pc` term:\n        $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 = 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc)$\n    *   Solve for `pc`:\n        $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):** Since the neutrino is treated as massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n        $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$. We can calculate this directly from the formula above.\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):** The total energy released in the decay (Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energies of the products.\n        $Q = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = (\\text{Initial rest energy}) - (\\text{Final rest energies})$\n        $Q = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n        Therefore, $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2) - KE_{\\nu}$.\n\n7.  **Computation:** Let's use Python to perform the calculations accurately. We can use the given rest mass values in MeV, which are technically rest energies ($m_0c^2$).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given rest energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate the momentum term pc using the derived formula\n# pc = (m_pi_c2^2 - m_mu_c2^2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to pc\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The total energy released is the difference in rest masses\nQ_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is the remaining energy\nKE_mu = Q_value - KE_nu\n\n# The question asks for KE of product particles, mu(+) first then nu\n# It's conventional to list the more massive particle's KE first.\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of Muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of Neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nKinetic Energy of Muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic Energy of Neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n</execute_result>\nBased on the calculation, the kinetic energy of the muon (${\\mu}^{+}$) is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino (${\\nu}$) is approximately 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the kinetic energies of the product particles, a muon (${\\mu}^{+}$) and a muon neutrino (${\\nu}$), from the decay of a stationary positive pion (${\\pi}^{+}$).\n\n**1. Principles:**\nThis decay must conserve both energy and momentum. Since the initial pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\n*   Initial momentum ($p_{initial}$) = 0.\n*   Final momentum ($p_{final}$) = $p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu}$.\n*   For momentum to be conserved ($p_{initial} = p_{final}$), the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   $|\\vec{p_{\\mu}}| = |\\vec{p_{\\nu}}| = p$\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy:**\n*   Initial energy ($E_{initial}$) = Rest energy of the pion = $m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n*   Final energy ($E_{final}$) = Total energy of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) + Total energy of the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$).\n*   Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$:\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the neutrino: We assume the neutrino is massless ($m_{\\nu} = 0$), so its energy is $E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n*   Setting $E_{initial} = E_{final}$:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**4. Solving for Momentum (pc):**\n*   Rearrange the equation: $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n*   Square both sides: $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n*   Expand and simplify: $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    *   $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n*   Isolate pc: $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**5. Calculating Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n*   **KE of Neutrino:** Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n    *   $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$\n*   **KE of Muon:** The total energy released (Q-value) is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energies, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the products.\n    *   $Q = KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n    *   Therefore, $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2) - KE_{\\nu}$\n\n**Given Values:**\n*   Rest energy of Pi(+) ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of mu(+) ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n\n**Calculation:**\nUsing the results from the executed Python code:\n1.  **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):** The calculation for `pc` yielded 29.78 MeV.\n    $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.8$ MeV\n2.  **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):** The code calculated this as 4.12 MeV.\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 4.12$ MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
