    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given two astronauts with different masses ($m_1 = 2m$, $m_2 = 3m$) moving at different relativistic speeds ($v_1 = 0.6c$, $v_2 = 0.5c$) in the same direction. We need to calculate two quantities:\n*   The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between them.\n*   The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the system.\n\n**2. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nSince the astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find their relative speed. The formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction is:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857... c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the equation $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 + \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2$\n\n**First, calculate the energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n\nCalculate its Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$:\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{0.6c}{c})^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow calculate its energy, $E_1$:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Next, calculate the energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nCalculate its Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{0.5c}{c})^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.5^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n$\\gamma_2 \\approx 1.1547$\n\nNow calculate its energy, $E_2$:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_2 \\approx 2 \\times 1.732 \\times mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Finally, calculate the total energy, $E_{total}$:**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\nTo be more precise, let's perform the final calculation using a python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate relative velocity\nv_rel_c = (0.6 - 0.5) / (1 - 0.6 * 0.5)\n\n# Calculate total energy\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - 0.6**2)\ne1_mc2 = gamma1 * 2\n\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - 0.5**2)\ne2_mc2 = gamma2 * 3\n\ne_total_mc2 = e1_mc2 + e2_mc2\n\nprint(f\"Relative speed in units of c: {v_rel_c:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Total energy in units of mc^2: {e_total_mc2:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\nRelative speed in units of c: 0.14\nTotal energy in units of mc^2: 5.96\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculations yield:\n*   Relative speed: $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   Total energy: $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe are given two astronauts with the following properties:\n*   Astronaut 1: mass $m_1 = 2m$, velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Astronaut 2: mass $m_2 = 3m$, velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nBoth astronauts are traveling in the same positive x-direction.
