    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a cyclic ketone. Let's analyze its alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O at C1).\n        *   The C2 position is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3). It has no alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   The C6 position is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5). It has one alpha-hydrogen.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which is an excellent Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The presence of a ketone (which can form an enolate), a Michael acceptor, and a base indicates a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Determine the Nucleophile (Enolate Formation):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the ketone at an alpha-carbon to form an enolate nucleophile.\n    *   Since C2 has no alpha-hydrogens, the deprotonation must occur at C6. The bulky t-BuOK removes the single alpha-hydrogen at the less substituted C6 position.\n    *   The enolate forms between C1 and C6. This enolate anion is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Determine the Electrophile and Site of Attack:**\n    *   The electrophile is the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the carbon further from the carbonyl/electron-withdrawing group) of the α,β-unsaturated system. So, the enolate attacks the CH₂ carbon of CH₂=CHCOOEt.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Product Structure:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The original C6, which was tertiary (C-H), becomes a quaternary center. It is now bonded to a methyl group and the newly added `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` chain.\n    *   The structure of the product is a cyclohexanone ring with the following substituents:\n        *   C1: =O (oxo group)\n        *   C2: ethyl group and methyl group (quaternary center)\n        *   C6: methyl group and an ethyl propanoate group (`-CH₂CH₂COOEt`) (newly formed quaternary center).\n\n5.  **Name the Product (A):**\n    *   The options provide names where the ethyl propanoate is the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent. Let's follow this convention.\n    *   Parent chain: ethyl propanoate. The ring is attached at position 3, so the name is `ethyl 3-(...-cyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment is C1.\n        *   Point of attachment (original C6) had a methyl group -> **1-methyl**.\n        *   The ketone carbonyl (original C1) is adjacent to the point of attachment -> **2-oxo**.\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) are on the next carbon over -> C3 of the substituent ring. So, **3-ethyl** and **3-methyl**.\n    *   Combining these parts alphabetically gives the substituent name: **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the product A described in options A and B. Options C and D have an incorrect ring structure (4-oxo instead of 2-oxo).\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH and H₂O\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic (pKa ≈ 10).\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (trans-CH₃CH=CHCN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, another classic Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Nucleophile (Carbanion Formation):**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the most acidic proton in the mixture, which is the α-proton of 1-nitropropane. This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion), which acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ ⇌ CH₃CH₂CH⁻(NO₂) + H₂O\n\n3.  **Determine the Electrophile and Site of Attack:**\n    *   The electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile (the carbon bearing the methyl group).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Product Structure:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   1-nitropropane part: `CH₃CH₂(NO₂)CH-`\n    *   but-2-enenitrile part: `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`\n    *   Combined structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`\n\n5.  **Name the Product (B):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent chain is a **nitrile**.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is 6 carbons long (`CH₃-CH₂-CH-CH-CH₂-CN`). So, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-C(1)N`\n    *   Identify the substituents and their positions:\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃) is at C3 -> **3-methyl**.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) is at C4 -> **4-nitro**.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the product B described in options A and C. The name in options B and D is for a molecule with a different carbon skeleton.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The correct structure for product A is named **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The correct structure for product B is named **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these findings with the given choices:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n\nOnly option A correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
