H₂PO₄⁻ is dihydrogen phosphate, which can act as a weak acid.\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissolves in water to produce 2 Na⁺ ions, HPO₄²⁻ ions (hydrogen phosphate), and 2 water molecules. HPO₄²⁻ is the conjugate base of H₂PO₄⁻.\n    *   Together, H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ form a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of the acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and the conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻).**\n    *   Molar mass of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n    *   Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n    *   So, we have 0.007348 moles of H₂PO₄⁻ and 0.005618 moles of HPO₄²⁻.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the acid and conjugate base.**\n    *   The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 200.00 mL or 0.20000 L.\n    *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻, [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n    *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻, [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n4.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺], in the buffer solution.**\n    *   The buffer system is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), which involves the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ conjugate pair.\n    *   The equilibrium is: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Kₐ₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n    *   The expression for Kₐ₂ is: Kₐ₂ = ([H⁺][HPO₄²⁻]) / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this formula to solve for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Kₐ₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   Plugging in the values: [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 / 0.02809) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M.\n\n5.  **Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻).**\n    *   Orthophosphate ions are formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, where HPO₄²⁻ acts as the acid.\n    *   The equilibrium is: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Kₐ₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n    *   The expression for Kₐ₃ is: Kₐ₃ = ([H⁺][PO₄³⁻]) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this formula to solve for the concentration of orthophosphate, [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Kₐ₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   We use the concentrations of HPO₄²⁻ and H⁺ that we've already determined. We can assume that the concentration of HPO₄²⁻ is not significantly altered by this third, very weak dissociation.\n    *   Plugging in the values: [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M, which matches option C.\n\nA quicker way to see this relationship is:\nFor the equilibrium HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻, the dissociation constant is Kₐ₃ = ([H⁺][PO₄³⁻])/[HPO₄²⁻].\nFrom the Henderson-Hasselbalch perspective, p[H⁺] ≈ pKₐ₂ when the buffer concentrations are similar. Thus, [H⁺] ≈ Kₐ₂.\nSubstituting [H⁺] ≈ Kₐ₂ into the Kₐ₃ expression gives:\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ Kₐ₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / Kₐ₂)\nThe exact calculation confirmed this approach leads to the correct result.\n\nLet's verify the calculation with a final script.\n```python\n# Moles calculation\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = 1.00 / 136.09\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = 1.00 / 177.99\n\n# Concentration calculation\nvolume_L = 0.20000\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# H+ concentration calculation from the buffer\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# PO4^3- concentration calculation\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e} M\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n6.24e-07 M\n</execute_result>\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of the buffer components.**\nThe buffer is composed of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n\n*   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = Mass of KH₂PO₄ / Molar mass of KH₂PO₄\n    Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = Mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O / Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O\n    Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\nThe total volume is 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L.\n\n*   Initial concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Initial concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the relevant buffer system.**\nThe buffer system is H₂PO₄⁻ / HPO₄²⁻, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄).\nThe equilibrium is: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\nThe corresponding acid dissociation constant is Kₐ₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\nFrom the equilibrium expression, Kₐ₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻].\nWe can rearrange to solve for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Kₐ₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻).**\nThe orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻.\nThe equilibrium is: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\nThe corresponding acid dissociation constant is Kₐ₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\nFrom the equilibrium expression, Kₐ₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻].\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Kₐ₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nNow, we plug in the values we have calculated. We assume that the concentration of HPO₄²⁻ remains approximately 0.02809 M, as its dissociation is very small.\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.
