    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept:** The problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to its energy. This relationship is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n2.  **State the Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) of a quantum state is inversely proportional to its lifetime (Δt or τ). The mathematical relationship is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π). For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can use the approximation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Define \"Clearly Resolved\":** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their energies (|E1 - E2|) must be greater than the uncertainty (or \"width\") of the individual energy levels. Each level is not a sharp line but is \"broadened\" due to its finite lifetime. The width of each level is given by its ΔE.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State:**\n    *   State 1 has a lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s.\n    *   State 2 has a lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s.\n\n    The energy uncertainty for each state is:\n    *   ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\n    *   ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\n\n5.  **Determine the Limiting Factor:** To resolve both levels, the energy separation must be larger than the broadest of the two energy widths. The state with the *shorter lifetime* will have the *larger energy uncertainty*.\n    *   τ1 (10⁻⁹ s) < τ2 (10⁻⁸ s)\n    *   Therefore, ΔE1 > ΔE2.\n\n    The critical value we need to exceed is the energy width of the first state, ΔE1. This is the larger source of \"blurriness\". So, the condition for the levels to be clearly resolved is:\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE1\n\n6.  **Calculate the Minimum Energy Difference:** We need to calculate the value of ΔE1.\n    *   We use the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ, in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s) to get the energy uncertainty directly in eV.\n    *   ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    Now, we can perform the calculation.\n\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n    hbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n    # Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\n    tau1 = 1e-9\n    tau2 = 1e-8\n\n    # Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state using the uncertainty principle (Delta_E ~ hbar / tau)\n    delta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\n    delta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n    print(f\"Lifetime of state 1 (τ1): {tau1:.1e} s\")\n    print(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Lifetime of state 2 (τ2): {tau2:.1e} s\")\n    print(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # The minimum energy separation required to resolve the two levels is determined by the larger of the two uncertainties.\n    # A state with a shorter lifetime has a larger energy uncertainty.\n    # Since tau1 < tau2, delta_E1 will be the larger uncertainty and the limiting factor.\n    min_energy_separation = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\n    print(f\"The energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger uncertainty, which is ΔE1.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the required energy difference must be > {min_energy_separation:.4e} eV.\")\n\n    ```\n    \n    <execute_output>\n    Lifetime of state 1 (τ1): 1.0e-09 s\n    Energy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.5821e-07 eV\n    ------------------------------\n    Lifetime of state 2 (τ2): 1.0e-08 s\n    Energy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.5821e-08 eV\n    ------------------------------\n    The energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger uncertainty, which is ΔE1.\n    Therefore, the required energy difference must be > 6.5821e-07 eV.\n    </execute_output>\n    \n7.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculation shows that the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than approximately 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Let's examine the given options:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV (This is much smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV (This is much larger than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV (This is smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Only option B (10⁻⁴ eV) provides an energy separation that is significantly larger than the natural energy width of the broader state (state 1). Therefore, this is the only energy difference that would allow the two levels to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<B>>>"
