    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the starting material and the reaction it undergoes.\n\n### 1. The Reactant and its IHD\n\nThe starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its molecular formula and IHD.\n*   **Cyclohexene ring**: A six-membered ring with one double bond. This contributes 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the double bond) = 2 to the IHD.\n*   **Carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**: Contains one C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Formyl group (-CHO)**: Contains one C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH2)**: Contains one C=C double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\n\nThe total IHD of the reactant is the sum of these contributions: 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (carboxyl C=O) + 1 (formyl C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine its molecular formula:\n*   Carbons (C): 6 (in the ring) + 1 (from -COOH) + 1 (from -CHO) + 2 (from -CH=CH2) = 10 carbons.\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 (from -COOH) + 1 (from -CHO) = 3 oxygens.\n*   Hydrogens (H): By drawing the structure and counting, we find there are 12 hydrogens.\n*   The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe IHD can be calculated using the formula: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 (where O does not affect the calculation).\nIHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of several oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds. Specifically:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to alkanes (-CH₃).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to alkanes (-CH₃).\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\n### 3. The Product and its IHD\n\nApplying this to our reactant:\n*   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group, removing the C=O double bond (IHD change of -1).\n*   The -CHO group is reduced to a -CH₃ group, removing the C=O double bond (IHD change of -1).\n*   The C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond (IHD change of -1).\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a C-C single bond, converting it to an ethyl group (IHD change of -1).\n\nThe original cyclohexane ring structure remains. A ring itself corresponds to an IHD of 1. Since all the double bonds (both C=O and C=C) have been removed, the only feature contributing to the IHD in the final product is the cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe final product is 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane. Its molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nLet's calculate the IHD for the product:\n*   Using the structure: The product is a cycloalkane, which contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n*   Using the molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀): IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThus, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
