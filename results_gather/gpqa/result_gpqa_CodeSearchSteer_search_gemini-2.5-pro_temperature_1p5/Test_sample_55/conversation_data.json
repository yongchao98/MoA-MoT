    "The final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\nHere's a step-by-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial and final states:**\n    *   Initial state: `|n=3, l=0, m=0⟩` or `|3,0,0⟩`. This is a 3s orbital.\n    *   Final state: `|n=1, l=0, m=0⟩` or `|1,0,0⟩`. This is a 1s orbital.\n\n2.  **Understand the transition process:**\n    *   A direct transition from `|3,0,0⟩` to `|1,0,0⟩` is forbidden by the electric dipole selection rules because the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, `Δl`, would be 0.\n    *   The problem states the decay occurs via *two* dipole transitions, implying a cascade through an intermediate state.\n    *   Let the intermediate state be `|n',l',m'⟩`.\n\n3.  **Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules:**\n    The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   `Δl = ±1`\n    *   `Δm = 0, ±1`\n\n4.  **Determine the intermediate state:**\n    *   **First transition (`|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩`):**\n        *   The initial state has `l=0`. To satisfy `Δl = ±1`, the intermediate state must have `l'=1`.\n        *   The problem specifies the route goes via `n=2` states, so `n'=2`.\n        *   The initial state has `m=0`. To satisfy `Δm = 0, ±1`, the intermediate state can have `m' = 0, +1,` or `-1`.\n        *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`, and `|2,1,-1⟩`.\n    *   **Second transition (`|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`):**\n        *   The final state has `l=0`. The intermediate state has `l'=1`. So, `Δl = 0 - 1 = -1`, which is allowed.\n        *   The final state has `m=0`. The intermediate state has `m'`. So, `Δm = 0 - m'`. Since `m'` can be `0, ±1`, `Δm` can be `0, ∓1`, all of which are allowed.\n    *   Therefore, all three cascade routes are possible:\n        *   `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n        *   `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n        *   `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n    This confirms that the routes listed in options A, C, and D are valid.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    *   The probability of a particular cascade route depends on the branching ratio of the first transition, `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩`, since the second transition, `|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`, is the only allowed decay channel from the 2p state (its probability is essentially 1).\n    *   The rate of spontaneous emission for a transition from an initial state `|i⟩` to a final state `|f⟩` is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, `|<f|**r**|i>|²`.\n    *   We need to compare the transition rates from the initial `|3,0,0⟩` state to the three possible intermediate states `|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`, and `|2,1,-1⟩`.\n    *   The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is spherically symmetric. The dipole interaction, responsible for the transition, does not have a preferred direction in the absence of external fields. Due to this rotational symmetry, the probability of decaying into any of the magnetic sublevels `m' = -1, 0, +1` of the `l'=1` state must be equal.\n    *   Therefore, the total probability of transitioning from `|3,0,0⟩` to the `|2,1,m'⟩` manifold is split equally among the three `m'` states.\n    *   Total probability = P(m'=-1) + P(m'=0) + P(m'=1) = 1\n    *   Since P(m'=-1) = P(m'=0) = P(m'=1), each probability must be `1/3`.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   A) Path: `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩`. The probability is `1/3`. This matches our calculation.\n    *   B) Path: `|...⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩`. The probability is `2/3`. This is incorrect.\n    *   C) Path: `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩`. The probability is `1/4`. This is incorrect.\n    *   D) Path: `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩`. The probability is `1/4`. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on the principles of quantum mechanics and electric dipole selection rules, the only correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
