    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to determine the energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus.\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus and its Components\nThe problem specifies the nucleus X as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it contains 3 protons.\n*   The nucleus is therefore composed of 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons, A = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   This defines the nucleus as Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n### 2. Determine the Rest Energy (E₀) of the Nucleus\nThe rest energy of the nucleus can be calculated by summing the rest masses of its constituent nucleons (protons and neutrons) and converting that mass to energy. This approach ignores the nuclear binding energy, which is a common simplification in such problems unless specified otherwise.\n\n*   **Rest mass of a proton (mₚ):** 938.272 MeV/c²\n*   **Rest mass of a neutron (mₙ):** 939.565 MeV/c²\n\nThe total rest mass of the nucleus (m₀) is the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons:\nm₀ = 3 * mₚ + 3 * mₙ\nm₀ = 3 * (938.272 MeV/c²) + 3 * (939.565 MeV/c²)\nm₀ = 2814.816 MeV/c² + 2818.695 MeV/c²\nm₀ = 5633.511 MeV/c²\n\nThe rest energy (E₀) is therefore:\nE₀ = 5633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe nucleus is traveling at a speed (v) of 0.96c, where c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor (γ) is calculated using the formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nSubstituting v = 0.96c:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\nγ = 1 / √(0.0784)\nγ = 1 / 0.28\nγ ≈ 3.5714\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)\nThe total relativistic energy (E) is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy:\nE = γ * E₀\nE ≈ 3.5714 * 5.633511 GeV\nE ≈ 20.11968 GeV\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\nThe calculated energy is approximately 20.1197 GeV. Now, let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 20.132 GeV\nB) 23.069 GeV\nC) 18.475 GeV\nD) 21.419 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.120 GeV is extremely close to option A (20.132 GeV). The minor difference (about 0.06%) can be attributed to using slightly different values for the physical constants of proton and neutron mass. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
