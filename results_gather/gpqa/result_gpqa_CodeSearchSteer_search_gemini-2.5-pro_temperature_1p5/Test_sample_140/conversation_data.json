    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible organic products can be determined by considering all feasible reaction pathways.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is generally the faster reaction due to the kinetic isotope effect (a C-H bond is broken more easily than a C-D bond). The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 generates a **3-deuterobenzyne** intermediate. In this intermediate, the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remains at C2.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2. Although slower, this pathway is still possible. The removal of the deuteron and the subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 result in the formation of a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium at C2 was removed, the resulting intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻), acting as a nucleophile, then attacks the highly reactive benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The NH₂⁻ nucleophile can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond. These two positions are not equivalent because of the nearby deuterium atom.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** This leads to the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** This leads to the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The NH₂⁻ nucleophile attacks the symmetric benzyne intermediate. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same product after protonation.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** This leads to the formation of non-deuterated **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince both elimination pathways are possible, a total of three distinct organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline\n2.  3-deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
