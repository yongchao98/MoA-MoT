  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "The lack of protein overexpression is due to a premature stop codon in the engineered genetic sequence, which halts protein synthesis. To understand why, the provided DNA sequence must be translated into its corresponding amino acid sequence.\n\nThe process of translation begins with a start codon, which also codes for the amino acid Methionine. The DNA sequence is then read in groups of three nucleotides, called codons, to build the protein chain.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the initial part of your construct's sequence:\n\n*   **5'-ATG...** This is the universal start codon, corresponding to the first amino acid, Methionine (M).\n*   **...TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC...** This segment codes for the amino acid sequence Tyrosine-Proline-Tyrosine-Aspartic acid-Valine-Proline-Aspartic acid-Tyrosine-Alanine (YPYDVPDYA). This is the correct sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. Therefore, the tag itself does not contain a missense mutation.\n*   **...AAA...** This codon immediately follows the HA tag sequence and codes for the amino acid Lysine (K).\n*   **...TGA...** This is a stop codon.\n\nWhen the ribosome, the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis, encounters this `TGA` codon, it terminates translation. As a result, instead of producing the full-length GADD45G protein with an N-terminal HA tag, the cell produces only a very short peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K). This explains the inability to detect the overexpressed protein.\n\nThe other potential reasons are incorrect:\n*   **A) Lack of a linker sequence:** While linkers can be important for protein folding and stability, their absence would not prevent the initial synthesis of the full protein. The primary issue here is that the full protein is not being made in the first place.\n*   **B) Missense mutation in the antigenic determinant:** The analysis shows the DNA correctly codes for the YPYDVPDYA amino acid sequence of the HA tag.\n*   **D) Non-existent tRNA for the UAA codon:** This statement is biologically incorrect. UAA is a stop codon and is recognized by release factors, not a specific tRNA, to terminate translation. Furthermore, the codon in question is TGA, not UAA.\n\n<<<C>>>"
