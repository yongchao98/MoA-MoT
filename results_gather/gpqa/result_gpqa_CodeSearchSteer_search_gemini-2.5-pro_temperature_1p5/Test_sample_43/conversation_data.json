    "The correct answer is B because the proposed experiment is based on a flawed biological premise. Here is a detailed breakdown of why each option is or is not helpful for investigating the drug's effect on mitochondria:\n\n*   **A) Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells:** This experiment is **helpful**. Mito-RTP is a ratiometric fluorescent probe used to visualize temperature within mitochondria. Since mitochondrial activity and energy production generate heat, measuring temperature changes can be an indicator of altered mitochondrial function. Confocal microscopy allows for high-resolution imaging of these changes within the organelle.\n\n*   **B) Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit:** This experiment is **not helpful**. The fundamental issue lies in the assay being performed on isolated mitochondria. In a cell, glucose is taken up from the extracellular environment into the cytoplasm by glucose transporters on the cell membrane. In the cytoplasm, glycolysis breaks down glucose into pyruvate. It is pyruvate, not glucose, that is then transported into the mitochondria to fuel the Krebs cycle and subsequent ATP production. Mitochondria do not have the necessary transporters to take up glucose directly. Therefore, measuring glucose uptake on isolated mitochondria will not yield any biologically meaningful data about the drug's effect.\n\n*   **C) Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 μM of luciferin addition to the supernatant:** This experiment is **helpful**. The reaction between luciferase, its substrate luciferin, and ATP produces light. The amount of light emitted, measured by a luminometer, is directly proportional to the amount of ATP present in the cells. Since mitochondria are the primary producers of cellular ATP, a drug affecting mitochondrial function would likely lead to a change in total cellular ATP levels, which this assay would detect.\n\n*   **D) Flow cytometry after labeling with 2.5 μM 5,5',6,6'-Tetrachloro-1,1',3, 3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide:** This experiment is **helpful**. The long chemical name refers to the well-known fluorescent dye JC-1. JC-1 is used to measure the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). In healthy mitochondria with a high membrane potential, JC-1 forms aggregates that fluoresce red/orange, while in unhealthy mitochondria with a low potential, it remains as monomers that fluoresce green. Flow cytometry can quantify the ratio of red to green fluorescence in a large cell population, providing a robust measurement of mitochondrial health.\n\n<<<B>>>"
