    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the physics of particle decay and time dilation.**\n    *   The number of particles `N` that survive after a time `t` in their own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`, where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n    *   Due to time dilation in special relativity, the lifetime of a particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` appears longer to an observer in the lab frame. This dilated lifetime `t'` is given by `t' = γτ`.\n    *   The decay law as observed in the lab frame is therefore: `N(t_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / (γτ))`.\n\n2.  **Set up the equation for the fraction of surviving particles.**\n    *   The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n    *   The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R = 30 m` in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n    *   The fraction of particles (`F`) that reach the detector wall is the ratio `N(t_lab) / N₀`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and the dilated lifetime, we get:\n        `F = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ))`\n\n3.  **Use the initial condition to find a constant term.**\n    *   We are given that for an initial Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of surviving particles is `F₁ = 1/3`.\n    *   Plugging these values into the equation:\n        `1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20τ))`\n    *   To solve this, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -R / (20cτ)`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n        `-ln(3) = -R / (20cτ)`\n        `ln(3) = R / (20cτ)`\n    *   This allows us to find the value of the constant term `R/(cτ)` which is characteristic of the particle and the detector setup:\n        `R/(cτ) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n4.  **Set up the equation for the second scenario and solve for the new Lorentz factor `γ₂`.**\n    *   We want to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which the fraction of surviving particles is `F₂ = 2/3`.\n    *   The governing equation is the same:\n        `F₂ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂τ))`\n        `2/3 = exp(-(R/(cτ)) / γ₂)`\n    *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -(R/(cτ)) / γ₂`\n    *   Now, substitute the value of `R/(cτ)` that we found in step 3:\n        `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    *   Using the logarithm properties `ln(x/y) = ln(x) - ln(y)` and `-ln(x) = ln(1/x)`:\n        `ln(2) - ln(3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n        `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n        `ln(3) - ln(2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    *   Now, isolate `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n5.  **Calculate the numerical value.**\n    *   Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`:\n        `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / (1.0986 - 0.6931)`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 68\nB) 40\nC) 28\nD) 54\n\nThe calculated value of ~54.19 is closest to 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
