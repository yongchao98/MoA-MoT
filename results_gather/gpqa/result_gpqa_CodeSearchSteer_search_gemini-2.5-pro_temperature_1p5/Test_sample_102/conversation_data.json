    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene with a high yield, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step. The target molecule has three substituents—acetyl (-COCH3), bromo (-Br), and nitro (-NO2)—all in a *meta* relationship to each other (positions 1, 3, and 5).\n\nLet's analyze the proposed reaction sequence in option B:\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n\n1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene reacts with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   Benzene → Acetophenone\n\n2.  **ii) Bromination:** Acetophenone undergoes electrophilic bromination. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine atom is added at the meta position (C3).\n    *   Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone\n\n3.  **iii) Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone is nitrated. We have two directing groups: the acetyl group at C1 (meta-director) and the bromo group at C3 (ortho,para-director). The positions *ortho* and *para* to the bromine are C2, C4, and C6. The position *meta* to the acetyl group is C5. The directing effects are in conflict. However, experimental evidence shows that nitration occurs predominantly at the position activated by the bromine and not strongly deactivated by the acetyl group, which is position C4 (ortho to Br). Position C5 is not the major product at this stage. The major product is 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone.\n    *   3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone\n\n4.  **iv) Reduction of Nitro Group:** The nitro group (-NO2) is reduced to an amino group (-NH2) using iron in acidic medium (Fe/HCl).\n    *   1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone\n\n5.  **v) Second Nitration:** Now, the ring has three substituents: -COCH3 (meta-director), -Br (o,p-director), and -NH2 (strong o,p-director). The amino group is a very powerful activating director and will control the position of the next substitution. It directs the incoming nitro group to the positions *ortho* or *para* to it. The para position is C1 (blocked by the acetyl group). The ortho positions are C3 (blocked by Br) and C5. The -COCH3 group also directs *meta* to itself, to position C5. Therefore, both the powerful amino group and the acetyl group direct the nitration to C5.\n    *   1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone → 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone\n\n6.  **vi) Diazotization:** The primary amino group (-NH2) is treated with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) at low temperatures to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanediazonium chloride\n\n7.  **vii) Deamination:** The diazonium salt is treated with hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2). This reaction removes the diazonium group and replaces it with a hydrogen atom.\n    *   1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanediazonium chloride → **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**\n\nThis sequence successfully produces the target molecule in high yield by using a powerful directing group (-NH2) to install substituents in the desired positions and then removing it.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   **A:** Fails at step (iii) because Friedel-Crafts acylation does not work on anilines.\n*   **C:** Fails at step (iii) because Friedel-Crafts acylation does not work on a strongly deactivated ring like 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.\n*   **D:** The first four steps simply convert benzene back into benzene, making the sequence illogical.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of reactions is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
