    "The search results confirm the key principles for the reaction of organocuprates (Gilman reagents) with epoxides.\n\n*   **Regioselectivity**: Organocuprates are soft, nucleophilic reagents that attack epoxides in an SN2 fashion. This attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction proceeds via a backside attack, which leads to an inversion of configuration at the carbon center being attacked. The overall result is a *trans*-diaxial opening when applied to cyclic systems like cyclohexene oxides.\n\nBased on this, the analysis proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Substrate and Reagent**:\n    *   Substrate: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with a fused epoxide. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   Reagent: Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), which provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)**:\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by C1, C6, and the oxygen atom.\n    *   C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a tertiary carbon center within the epoxide.\n    *   C6 has no methyl group substituent, making it a secondary carbon center.\n    *   The nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon, which is C6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**:\n    *   The reaction is an Sₙ2-type opening. The methyl nucleophile attacks C6 from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   This results in the inversion of the stereocenter at C6. The initial configuration is (6S), so after inversion, it becomes (R).\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not affected by the reaction and are retained.\n    *   The epoxide ring opens, and after workup (which is implicit), the oxygen atom attached to C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n4.  **Identify and Name the Product**:\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with four methyl groups.\n    *   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 remain. A new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   To name the product, the ring must be re-numbered according to IUPAC rules for cyclohexanols. The carbon bearing the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as the new C1.\n    *   Numbering the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants results in the set {1, 2, 4, 5}. The former C6 is now C2, former C3 is now C5, and former C4 is now C4.\n    *   The product name is therefore 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n5.  **Assign the Stereochemistry to the Product**:\n    *   Configuration at new C1 (old C1) is retained: **(1R)**.\n    *   Configuration at new C2 (old C6) is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n    *   Configuration at new C4 (old C4) is retained: **(4R)**.\n    *   Configuration at new C5 (old C3) is retained: **(5R)**.\n    *   The full IUPAC name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis detailed analysis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
