    "### Analysis of the Starting Material\n\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is calculated to be 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring.\n\nThe 1H-NMR data provides the following information:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group. This confirms a `-CH2CHO` fragment.\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- (methylene) protons. The doublet (d) splitting confirms they are adjacent to a single proton, which is the aldehyde proton. This further supports the `-CH2CHO` fragment.\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons and appearing as doublets, are classic indicators of a 1,4- or para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n\nAssembling these fragments, the only logical structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The `-NH2` and `-CH2CHO` groups are attached at the para positions of the benzene ring.\n\n### Reaction Sequence Analysis\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl, followed by H2O:** This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine, followed by hydrolysis.\n    *   The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) on the starting material is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    *   The addition of water (H2O), typically with warming, hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing it with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   The intermediate product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves treating the intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat.\n    *   This aldehyde possesses acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group. These conditions are ideal for a self-condensation reaction known as the **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an alpha-proton to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This addition reaction initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (B), which is the aldol addition product.\n    *   However, the reaction is heated, which promotes a dehydration (or condensation) step. A molecule of water is eliminated to form a more stable, conjugated system. The product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final product, after the complete three-step sequence including the heat-induced condensation, is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
