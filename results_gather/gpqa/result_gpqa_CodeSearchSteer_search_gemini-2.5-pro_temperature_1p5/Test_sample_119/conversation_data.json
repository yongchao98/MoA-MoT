    "The logical derivation I performed seems correct and is a standard approach for this type of problem in astrophysics. The search results confirm the fundamental relationship between parallax and distance (`d = 1/p`) and discuss star counts, but they do not directly provide the derived relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax and the parallax itself. The derivation relies on combining the volume of a spherical shell (`~d² * Δd`) with the relationship between distance and parallax.\n\nHere is a step-by-step confirmation of the initial derivation:\n1.  **Uniform Star Density:** Assume stars are uniformly distributed in space with a constant number density, ρ.\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Shell:** The number of stars, dN, in a thin spherical shell of radius *d* and thickness *dd* is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is its surface area (`4πd²`) times its thickness (`dd`).\n    *   `dN = ρ * (4πd²) * dd`\n3.  **Parallax-Distance Relationship:** The parallax, *plx*, is inversely proportional to the distance *d*.\n    *   `plx = 1/d` which means `d = 1/plx`\n4.  **Relate Thicknesses:** We need to find the relationship between the thickness of the shell in terms of distance (`dd`) and the corresponding interval in parallax (`d(plx)`). We can do this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `d(d)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   Therefore, `dd = |(-1/plx²) * d(plx)| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`. We take the absolute value as we are interested in the magnitude of the interval.\n5.  **Substitute into the Number Equation:** Now substitute the expressions for *d* and *dd* in terms of *plx* into the equation for *dN*.\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n6.  **Find Number per Unit Parallax:** The quantity of interest is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n7.  **Conclusion:** Since `4πρ` is a constant, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis confirms the initial result. The number of stars per unit parallax range varies as `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
