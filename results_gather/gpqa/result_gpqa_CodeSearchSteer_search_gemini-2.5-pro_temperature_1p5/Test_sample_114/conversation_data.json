    "To solve this problem, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. The total energy and momentum of the electron-positron system before the collision must equal the total energy and momentum of the two photons after the annihilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Define Initial Conditions**\n    *   The rest mass of an electron and a positron are identical; we'll call it `m`.\n    *   The electron moves from the left with a Lorentz factor, γ_e = 4.\n    *   The positron moves from the right with a Lorentz factor, γ_p = 2.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Energy**\n    The energy `E` of a particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   Electron energy (E_e): 4mc²\n    *   Positron energy (E_p): 2mc²\n    *   Total initial energy (E_initial) = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²\n\n3.  **Calculate Initial Momentum**\n    The momentum `p` of a relativistic particle is given by p = mc√(γ² - 1).\n    *   Let's define the direction of the electron's motion as the positive x-axis.\n    *   Electron momentum (p_e): mc√(4² - 1) = mc√15 (in the +x direction)\n    *   Positron momentum (p_p): mc√(2² - 1) = mc√3 (in the -x direction)\n    *   Total initial momentum (p_initial) is the vector sum. Since the motion is entirely along the horizontal axis, the total momentum is:\n        p_initial = (mc√15) - (mc√3) = mc(√15 - √3)\n\n4.  **Define Final Conditions (Photons)**\n    *   The collision produces two photons.\n    *   The photons have equal energy, let's call it E_γ.\n    *   One photon moves upper-right, and the other lower-right. Due to momentum conservation in the vertical direction, their angles with the horizontal axis must be equal and opposite. Let's call this angle θ.\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation of Energy**\n    The total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   6mc² = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ\n    *   Therefore, the energy of each photon is E_γ = 3mc².\n\n6.  **Determine Photon Momentum**\n    The momentum of a photon (p_γ) is its energy divided by the speed of light: p_γ = E_γ / c.\n    *   p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc.\n\n7.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n    The total initial momentum must equal the total final momentum. We only need to consider the horizontal (x-axis) component, as the vertical components cancel out.\n    *   The horizontal component of each photon's momentum is p_γ * cos(θ).\n    *   Total final momentum (p_final) = (p_γ * cos(θ)) + (p_γ * cos(θ)) = 2p_γ * cos(θ).\n    *   Now, we set the initial and final momenta equal:\n        p_initial = p_final\n        mc(√15 - √3) = 2(3mc) * cos(θ)\n        mc(√15 - √3) = 6mc * cos(θ)\n\n8.  **Solve for the Angle**\n    We can cancel `mc` from both sides and solve for cos(θ).\n    *   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n    *   Using the approximate values √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732:\n        cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees\n\n9.  **Find the Total Angle Between Photons**\n    The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons. Since one moves at an angle `θ` above the horizontal and the other at `θ` below, the total angle between them is 2θ.\n    *   Total Angle = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\n<<<B>>>"
