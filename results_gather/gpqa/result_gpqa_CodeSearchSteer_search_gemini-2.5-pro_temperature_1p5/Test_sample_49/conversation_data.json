    "In quantum field theory, the mathematical expression for a Feynman diagram's amplitude contains factors that are directly related to the structure of the diagram. Specifically, in a common calculation scheme called dimensional regularization, each closed loop in a diagram contributes a characteristic factor of `1/(4π)²` to the overall formula.\n\nTherefore, a diagram with 'L' number of loops will have a factor of `(1/(4π)²)^L`, which simplifies to `1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nBy examining the scribbled note, `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`, we can identify the term `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\nComparing this to the general formula `1/(4π)^(2L)`, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L` gives:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other components of the expression relate to different parts of the calculation: `alpha^3` and `g^2` are related to the coupling constants (interaction strengths) and the number of vertices, while `(Q/M)^2` is a ratio of energy scales that typically appears after evaluating the loop integrals. However, the factor of `1/(4π)` is the most direct indicator of the number of loops.\n\nThus, the Feynman diagram had 3 loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
