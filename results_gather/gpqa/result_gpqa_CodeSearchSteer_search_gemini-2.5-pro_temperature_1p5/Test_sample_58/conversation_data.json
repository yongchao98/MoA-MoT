    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of acids and bases.**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH - a weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl - a strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   HCl dissociates completely, so moles of H⁺ = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂ - a strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely to yield two OH⁻ ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acid, starting with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) first, and then the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Total moles of acid:** 0.080 mol (strong) + 0.050 mol (weak) = 0.130 mol\n*   **Total moles of base:** 0.180 mol (strong)\n\nSince the moles of the strong base are greater than the total moles of acid, the base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n*   **Calculate excess moles of OH⁻:**\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = Total moles OH⁻ - Total moles acid\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻.**\n\nFirst, find the total volume of the solution.\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\nNow, calculate the final concentration of OH⁻.\n*   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n*   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**4. Calculate the pOH and then the pH.**\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
