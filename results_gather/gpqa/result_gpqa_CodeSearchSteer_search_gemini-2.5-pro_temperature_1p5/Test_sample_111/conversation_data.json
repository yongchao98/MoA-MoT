    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalization of the State |α>\n\nThe given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. We first need to normalize it. A quantum state |ψ> must satisfy the condition <ψ|ψ> = 1.\n\nLet |α> = C[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>], where C is the normalization constant.\n\nThe inner product <α|α> is:\n<α|α> = |C|² * [< (1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ]\nSince <up|up> = 1, <down|down> = 1, and <up|down> = <down|up> = 0, we have:\n<α|α> = |C|² * [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) ]\n<α|α> = |C|² * [ (1 - i²) + (4 - i²) ]\n<α|α> = |C|² * [ (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) ] = |C|² * (2 + 5) = 7|C|²\n\nFor normalization, we set <α|α> = 1:\n7|C|² = 1  => |C|² = 1/7 => C = 1/√7 (we choose the real, positive root).\n\nSo, the normalized state is:\n**|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]**\n\nIn vector notation, where |up> = (1, 0)ᵀ and |down> = (0, 1)ᵀ, the state is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * (1+i, 2-i)ᵀ\n\n### 2. Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of the Operator A\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements Aij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j, and Aij = 0 otherwise. In the {|up>, |down>} basis, this is a 2x2 matrix:\nA = (ħ/2) * [,]\n\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix, A = (ħ/2)σₓ.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues 'a', we solve the characteristic equation det(A - aI) = 0:\ndet( [[-a, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -a]] ) = (-a)(-a) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = a² - (ħ/2)² = 0\na² = ħ²/4\n**a = ±ħ/2**\n\nThe two eigenvalues are a₁ = +ħ/2 and a₂ = -ħ/2.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors (eigenstates):\n*   **For a₁ = +ħ/2:**\n    (A - a₁I) |v₁> = 0\n    [[ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = 0\n    This gives the equation -x + y = 0, or x = y.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is (1, 1)ᵀ. Normalizing it gives:\n    **|a₁> = (1/√2) * [|up> + |down>]**\n\n*   **For a₂ = -ħ/2:**\n    (A - a₂I) |v₂> = 0\n    [[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = 0\n    This gives the equation x + y = 0, or x = -y.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is (1, -1)ᵀ. Normalizing it gives:\n    **|a₂> = (1/√2) * [|up> - |down>]**\n\n### 3. Calculation of Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue aₙ is given by the Born rule, P(aₙ) = |<aₙ|α>|².\n\n*   **Probability P₁ of measuring a₁ = +ħ/2:**\n    <a₁|α> = (1/√2) * [<up| + <down|] * (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]\n    <a₁|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1)(1+i) + (1)(2-i) ]\n    <a₁|α> = (1/√14) * [ 1 + i + 2 - i ] = 3/√14\n    P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ **0.643**\n\n*   **Probability P₂ of measuring a₂ = -ħ/2:**\n    <a₂|α> = (1/√2) * [<up| - <down|] * (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]\n    <a₂|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1)(1+i) - (1)(2-i) ]\n    <a₂|α> = (1/√14) * [ 1 + i - 2 + i ] = (-1 + 2i)/√14\n    P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ **0.357**\n\nAs a check, the probabilities sum to one: 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Average Value\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A is given by <A> = Σ Pₙ * aₙ.\n<A> = P₁*a₁ + P₂*a₂\n<A> = (9/14) * (ħ/2) + (5/14) * (-ħ/2)\n<A> = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5)\n<A> = 4ħ/28 = **ħ/7**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is ħ/7. These results match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
