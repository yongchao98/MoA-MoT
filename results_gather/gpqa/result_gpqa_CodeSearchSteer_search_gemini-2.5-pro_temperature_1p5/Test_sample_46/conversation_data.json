    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of reference spectra, the correct compound is identified.\n\n### **Analysis of Provided Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group, likely an ester, as it is conjugated with a benzene ring.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This triplet corresponds to a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), which is part of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region that integrates to two protons is characteristic of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This quartet represents the methylene group (-CH2-) of an ethyl group that is attached to an oxygen atom (-OCH2CH3). The downfield shift is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen. This, along with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms an ethyl ester group.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region is a classic sign of a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is due to the protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group.\n\n### **Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Would show a complex aromatic splitting pattern, not two doublets.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The quartet for the methylene group next to the carbonyl would be much further upfield (around 2.2-2.6 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Would show only one N-H band in the IR for the secondary amide and would lack the broad 2H signal for a primary amine in the NMR.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The molecular formula is correct. The IR spectrum is consistent with a primary amine and a conjugated ester. The 1H NMR data perfectly matches the structure, showing an ethyl group, a primary aromatic amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with the expected chemical shifts. This compound is commonly known as benzocaine. Published spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirms these assignments.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe spectral data provided is unequivocally consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
