    "Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the correct terms to complete the statement.\n\n### Part 1: Thermodynamics\nThe first part of the statement is: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a ______ oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n\n*   The strength of an oxidant is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive reduction potential signifies a stronger oxidizing agent.\n*   In an acidic solution (pH 0), the reduction of oxygen to water has a standard reduction potential of +1.23 V.\n    *   **Reaction:** O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O; E° = +1.23 V\n*   In a basic solution (pH 14), the reduction of oxygen to hydroxide ions has a standard reduction potential of +0.40 V.\n    *   **Reaction:** O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻; E° = +0.40 V\n\nSince the reduction potential in a basic solution (+0.40 V) is less positive than in an acidic solution (+1.23 V), oxygen is thermodynamically a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\n### Part 2: Kinetics\nThe second part of the statement is: \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts ______ in acidic solutions.\"\n\n*   Kinetics refers to the speed of a reaction. The reduction of oxygen is notoriously slow, a phenomenon often described as having \"sluggish kinetics\". This slowness is due to a high activation energy barrier for the reaction.\n*   When comparing reaction rates in different media, studies often show that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is even slower in acidic solutions than in alkaline (basic) ones.\n*   Factors in acidic solutions, such as the mechanism involving proton-coupled electron transfer and the potential for anions to adsorb onto catalyst surfaces, can hinder the reaction rate compared to in basic media.\n\nTherefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\n### Conclusion\nCombining the two findings:\n1.  Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n2.  Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThis corresponds to the combination **weaker – slower**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
