    "This question describes a scenario directly analogous to the study of double-beta decay in nuclear physics.\n\n*   The first process, **2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V**, is equivalent to the standard, observed two-neutrino double-beta decay (2νββ). In this decay, two neutrons in a nucleus convert to two protons, emitting two electrons (the \"E\" particles) and two antineutrinos (the \"V\" particles). Because the available energy is shared among four light particles in the final state (two electrons and two antineutrinos), the sum of the kinetic energies of the two electrons has a broad, continuous spectrum.\n*   The second process, **2A -> 2B + 2E + M**, describes a hypothetical form of neutrinoless double-beta decay where a single, light particle called a Majoron (\"M\") is emitted. This process still results in a multi-body final state (two electrons and one Majoron, plus the recoiling nucleus).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the comparison:\n\n1.  **Nature of the Spectrum:** In the variant decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + M), the final state consists of the daughter nucleus and three light particles (2E + M). Whenever three or more particles are in the final state, they share the available decay energy. This results in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles. A discrete, single-energy spectrum would only occur if there were just two final particles (e.g., the daughter nucleus 2B and the pair of E particles), as is the case in the most commonly sought-after form of neutrinoless double-beta decay. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous, which eliminates options A and B.\n\n2.  **Endpoint of the Spectrum:** The endpoint of the energy spectrum is determined by the total energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value. This energy comes from the conversion of mass.\n    *   **Original Decay:** The total kinetic energy released is Q₁ = (Mass_2A - Mass_2B - 2*Mass_E - 2*Mass_V)c². The V particles (analogous to neutrinos) have a small but non-zero mass.\n    *   **Exotic Decay:** The problem states the new particle M is massless. The kinetic energy released is Q₂ = (Mass_2A - Mass_2B - 2*Mass_E - 0)c².\n\n    By comparing the two Q-values, it is clear that Q₂ is greater than Q₁ because the rest mass of the two V particles does not need to be created in the second decay. This extra energy is available as kinetic energy for the final particles. The endpoint of the total energy spectrum for the two E particles is the maximum kinetic energy they can have, which corresponds to the Q-value for that decay mode. Since Q₂ > Q₁, the endpoint of the spectrum increases.\n\n3.  **Shape of the Spectrum:** The statistical distribution of energy among the final particles is described by the phase space of the decay. Changing the number of particles in the final state from four light particles (2E + 2V) to three (2E + M) alters the phase space factor, which in turn changes the shape of the continuous energy spectrum. For example, the spectrum for Majoron-emitting decay is typically \"skewed toward higher electron energies\" compared to the two-neutrino mode.\n\nCombining these points, the new decay results in a spectrum that is still continuous, but with a different shape and a higher energy endpoint.\n\n<<<C>>>"
