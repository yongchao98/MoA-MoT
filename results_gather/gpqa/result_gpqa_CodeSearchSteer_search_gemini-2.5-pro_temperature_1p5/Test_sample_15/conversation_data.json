    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The optical activity for each compound is determined as follows:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule lacks a chiral center and possesses a plane of symmetry within the plane of the double bond. Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (3aR, 7aS). A compound that is a single, specific enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers, and this specific stereoisomer (2R,3R) does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is one of a pair of enantiomers and is therefore optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the R configuration at the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1), which is a chiral center. As a specific enantiomer, this compound is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this compound, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including multiple planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This molecule does not contain any chiral centers. Lacking a chiral center and any other element of chirality (like axial or planar chirality), it is achiral and not optically active.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
