    "To solve this, a detailed analysis of the expected proton (¹H) NMR splitting patterns for each of the four possible compounds is required. The key pieces of information from the NMR spectrum are the presence of a \"doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\" and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\". The FTIR data, with a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch), confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, which all four candidates possess.\n\nLet's break down the expected splitting patterns for the protons on the main carbon chain of each molecule. Splitting patterns arise from the interaction of a proton with its neighboring non-equivalent protons (n), following the n+1 rule. When a proton is coupled to multiple, different groups of neighbors, we see more complex patterns like doublets of triplets.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   Let's label the carbons starting from the COOH group: HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6).\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the two protons at C2 (a triplet), the single proton at C4 (a doublet), and the two protons of its ethyl group's CH₂ (another triplet). This would result in a **triplet of doublets of triplets (tdt)**.\n    *   The proton at C4 is coupled to the single proton at C3 (a doublet), the two protons at C5 (a triplet), and the two protons of its ethyl group's CH₂ (another triplet). This creates a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   This molecule perfectly matches one of the observed signals (dtt). Let's now search for a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). A dtq requires a proton to be coupled to one proton (d), two protons (t), and three protons (q). No single proton in this molecule fits this description. For example, the CH₂ at C5 is coupled to the proton at C4 (doublet) and the methyl group at C6 (quartet), but also has geminal coupling, resulting in a complex multiplet, likely a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq).\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6).\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the two protons at C2 (triplet), the one proton at C4 (doublet), and the three protons of its methyl group (quartet). This results in a **triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq)**, which can also be described as a dtq depending on coupling constants.\n    *   The proton at C4 is coupled to the one proton at C3 (doublet), the two protons at C5 (triplet), and the three protons of its methyl group (quartet). This also gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   This molecule (B) has two signals that could be described as `dtq` but lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: HOOC(1)-CH(2)(Me)-CH(3)(Me)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5).\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the one proton at C2 (doublet), the two protons at C4 (triplet), and the three protons of its methyl group (quartet). This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   This matches one of the required signals. However, looking for a `dtt` proton reveals none. The proton at C2 is a doublet of quartets (dq). Therefore, this molecule does not match all the data.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: HOOC(1)-CH(2)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5).\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the one proton at C2 (doublet), the two protons of its ethyl group's CH₂ (triplet), and the two protons at C4 (triplet). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   The proton at C2 is coupled to the one proton at C3 (doublet) and the two protons of its ethyl group's CH₂ (triplet), resulting in a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n    *   Therefore, this molecule provides the `dtt` signal but lacks the `dtq` signal.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, none of the molecules seem to possess both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. However, let's re-examine molecule A. It was previously assigned as having a `dtt` but not a `dtq`. It's possible there's a misunderstanding in my structural assignment from the condensed formula. Let's strictly follow the written formula for A: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`. This represents 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction in the provided data versus the expected patterns for the given options. Let's reconsider molecule **A: 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid.**\n- Proton at C4: `dtt`. Confirmed match.\n- Proton at C3: `dtt` (or more accurately, tdt). Close, but not a dtq.\n\nLet's re-examine **molecule B: 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid.**\n- Proton at C4: `dtq`. Confirmed match.\n- Proton at C3: `dtq`. Confirmed match.\nThis molecule has two `dtq` signals. It does not have a `dtt` signal.\n\nGiven the choices, and the high complexity of these molecules, there might be an intended answer where one structure is considered the best fit despite apparent discrepancies. Let's assume there is no error in the question.\n\nIf we revisit Molecule A: 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid, we confidently identified a proton (H4) with a **dtt** pattern. Now, we must find a proton that gives a **dtq** pattern. Let's look at the methylene protons (H5) on the main chain: `...CH(H4)-CH₂(H5)-CH₃(H6)`. These two H5 protons are diastereotopic. Each will be split by H4 (one proton, giving a doublet), H6 (three protons, giving a quartet), and the other H5 proton (geminal coupling, giving a doublet). This results in a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq), not a dtq. The same logic applies to the CH₂ groups in the ethyl substituents.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Molecule B: 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid. We found two protons (H3 and H4) that give a **dtq** signal. We need a **dtt**. No proton in this molecule couples to two different sets of two protons.\n\nLet's reconsider all options and the possibility of a subtle interpretation. The most complex and distinct signals described are the `dtt` and `dtq`. Molecule B provides a clear origin for a `dtq` (in fact, two of them). Molecule A provides a clear origin for a `dtt`. It's highly probable the correct structure must contain the features to produce both.\n\nLet's re-read the options one more time to ensure no misinterpretation of the condensed formulas.\nA) `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH` (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)\nB) `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH` (3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid)\nC) `CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)\nD) `CH3-CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH` (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)\n\nMy initial analyses stand:\n- A has a `dtt`.\n- B has a `dtq`.\n- C has a `dtq`.\n- D has a `dtt`.\n\nThis implies a potential error in the problem statement or options, as no single molecule has both signals. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, we must select the *best* possible answer. Let's assume there is a typographical error and that one of the molecules is the intended answer. Without further information, it's impossible to be certain.\n\nHowever, let's look at the structures again. Both `dtt` and `dtq` are highly complex splitting patterns arising from a single proton having three distinct groups of neighboring protons.\n- Proton for a `dtt` signal couples to (1H), (2H), and (2H).\n- Proton for a `dtq` signal couples to (1H), (2H), and (3H).\n\nThe structure in option A, **3,4-diethylhexanoic acid**, has protons that fit this environment.\n- The proton at C4 couples to H3 (1H), the CH₂ at C5 (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H). This gives the **dtt**.\n- The proton at C3 couples to H4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H). This gives another **dtt** (technically a triplet of doublets of triplets).\n\nLet's carefully check the methylene protons of the ethyl group at C4: `...CH(H4)-CH₂(H_Et)-CH₃`. The two `H_Et` protons are diastereotopic. Let's analyze one of them. It is coupled to H4 (1H, doublet), its geminal partner (1H, doublet), and the methyl group (3H, quartet). This gives a **doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq)**.\n\nIt seems my initial analysis is correct and there's an inconsistency in the question. However, if forced to choose the most plausible answer, let's reconsider the possibility of overlapping signals or similar coupling constants. In molecule B, both methine protons (H3 and H4) are `dtq`. It is the only structure that produces a `dtq`. Perhaps the `dtt` signal arises from a complex multiplet that appears like a `dtt` due to specific J-coupling values. This is less likely than finding a molecule that structurally fits both descriptions. Given the clear mismatch, there is ambiguity.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in my analysis and reconsider B.\n**B: 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid:**\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n- H3: Coupled to H2(2H, t), H4(1H, d), C3-Me(3H, q). → `tdq` (or `dtq`). **MATCH.**\n- H4: Coupled to H3(1H, d), H5(2H, t), C4-Me(3H, q). → `dtq`. **MATCH.**\n- This molecule definitively has a `dtq` signal. It does not have a `dtt` signal.\n\nSince Molecule B, 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid, is the only option that contains a proton environment that results in a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`), this is the most likely answer, assuming there might be an error in the reporting of the second signal or it arises from a more complex, less ideal pattern.\n\nFinal Check: Let's assume B is correct. We have a clear `dtq` (from H4). We also need a `dtt`. Where could it come from? There are no protons in B that are coupled to a 1H neighbor, a 2H neighbor, and another 2H neighbor. The analysis remains inconsistent with the question.\n\nGiven the options, and the fact that a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) arises from a proton adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group, let's analyze the skeletons:\n- A: -CH(Et)-**CH(Et)**-CH₂-\n- B: -CH(Me)-**CH(Me)**-CH₂- -> H coupled to CH, CH₂, CH₃. **This gives a dtq.**\n- C: -CH(Me)-**CH(Me)**-CH₂- -> H coupled to CH, CH₂, CH₃. **This gives a dtq.**\n- D: -CH(Et)-**CH(Et)**-CH₂-\n\nBoth B and C have a proton that will give a `dtq`. Let's analyze the `dtt` part again. This requires coupling to a CH, a CH₂, and another CH₂.\n- A: -CH(Et)-**CH(Et)**-CH₂- -> H coupled to CH, CH₂, CH₂(Et). **This gives a dtt.**\n- B: No such environment.\n- C: No such environment.\n- D: -CH(Et)-**CH(Et)**-CH₂- -> H coupled to CH, CH₂, CH₂(Et). **This gives a dtt.**\n\nSo, we have:\n- A: has `dtt`, no `dtq`\n- B: has `dtq`, no `dtt`\n- C: has `dtq`, no `dtt`\n- D: has `dtt`, no `dtq`\n\nThis is a flawed question. However, if a choice must be made, there might be a typo in one of the structures. Let's imagine structure B had one ethyl group and one methyl group: `CH3-CH2-CH(Me)-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\nThe proton on the carbon with the ethyl would be coupled to a CH(1H), a CH₂(2H), and another CH₂(2H), giving a `dtt`. The proton on the carbon with the methyl would be coupled to a CH(1H), a CH₂(2H), and a CH₃(3H), giving a `dtq`. This hypothetical molecule fits the data perfectly. Since this exact structure is not an option, and both A and B possess parts of the required features, a definitive answer from the provided list is problematic. Let's stick with the most unique feature. The `dtq` signal from B and C is very specific. The `dtt` from A and D is also specific. Since no molecule has both, I cannot logically conclude an answer. Assuming there is a typo in the question and only one of the signals is correct and diagnostic, this is still ambiguous.\n\nHowever, let's take a final look at B. It is 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid. It definitively has a proton coupled to a CH, a CH2, and a CH3, yielding a `dtq`. It is the only structure with this specific combination of methyl and other groups to create this pattern. The other signal, `dtt`, does not fit. Let's assume the question meant a different complex multiplet, or there's an error. Between the choices, B is the strongest candidate for the `dtq` signal.\n\nFinal decision based on finding the required patterns. No molecule fits both. But both B and C offer a `dtq`. Both A and D offer a `dtt`. There must be an error in the question. But if forced to select, I'll review again.\n\nRe-evaluating B: `CH3-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-CH2-COOH` (3,4-dimethyl**hexanoic** acid). My previous analysis for B (`-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-CH₂-`) was incorrect.\nThe structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-CH₂-COOH`. Let's re-analyze `3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid`.\nHOC(1)O-CH₂(2)-C(3)H(Me)-C(4)H(Me)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃.\nH4: coupled to H3(d), H5(t), C4-Me(q). This is a **dtq**.\nH3: coupled to H4(d), H2(t), C3-Me(q). This is also a **dtq**.\nSo B has `dtq` signals, but no `dtt`. My initial analysis was correct. Let's go with B as it's the only one providing the dtq signal. It's possible \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" was a mistake for the second `dtq` or another complex multiplet.\n\n<<<B>>>"
