    "Radioactive decay is a stochastic process governed by the exponential decay law. A key characteristic of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability. We need to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes, treating it as if we started monitoring it at t=0.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n### 1. Understand the Formula for Radioactive Decay\n\nThe probability `P(t)` that an atom will decay within a certain time `t` is given by the formula:\n*   `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, a value representing the decay probability per unit of time.\n*   `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nThe probability of an atom *surviving* (not decaying) is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n\n*   `P(100) = 0.32`\n\nUsing the formula:\n*   `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n\nFirst, solve for `e^(-100λ)`:\n*   `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n*   `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nNow, solve for λ by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n*   `-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n*   `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\nCalculating the value:\n*   `ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857`\n*   `λ ≈ -(-0.3857) / 100`\n*   `λ ≈ 0.003857` per minute\n\n### 3. Calculate the Decay Probability for the Next 150 Minutes\n\nDue to the memoryless property, we need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval.\n\n*   `t = 150` minutes\n\nUsing the probability formula with our calculated `λ`:\n*   `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n*   `P(150) = 1 - e^(-0.003857 * 150)`\n*   `P(150) = 1 - e^(-0.57855)`\n\nNow, calculate the value of `e^(-0.57855)`:\n*   `e^(-0.57855) ≈ 0.5607`\n\nFinally, calculate the probability:\n*   `P(150) = 1 - 0.5607`\n*   `P(150) = 0.4393`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
