    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under a specific set of assumptions. Analyzing the provided options based on the established theory of space-charge-limited current (SCLC) reveals the correct conditions.\n\nThe key assumptions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation are:\n*   The device contains only one type of mobile charge carrier (a single-carrier device).\n*   The semiconductor is free from charge traps.\n*   The contacts are Ohmic, meaning they provide an unlimited supply of charge carriers without any energy barrier, ensuring that the current is not limited by the injection process.\n*   The current within the device is dominated by the drift of charge carriers under the applied electric field, and the contribution from diffusion current is negligible.\n*   The concentration of intrinsic charge carriers in the material is negligible compared to the injected charge carriers.\n\nEvaluating the given statements:\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement correctly incorporates the key assumptions: a trap-free material, a single carrier type, no injection barrier (which corresponds to an Ohmic contact), and a negligible diffusion current.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the model assumes a single-carrier device.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect as a Schottky contact implies an injection barrier, violating the assumption of Ohmic contacts.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law specifically describes a drift-dominated current; it is the diffusion current that is assumed to be negligible.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that accurately describes the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
