    "The problem asks for the maximum speed ($v_{max}$) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. To solve this, we will use the principle of conservation of energy, taking into account the formulas of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Define the System and States\n\n*   **System:** A mass $m$ subject to a restoring force $F = -kx$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from equilibrium.\n*   **Potential Energy:** The potential energy stored in the oscillator is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n*   **State 1: Maximum Amplitude (x = A)**\n    *   The mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n    *   The kinetic energy is zero.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the system includes the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the potential energy. Thus, $E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n*   **State 2: Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**\n    *   The mass is moving at its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The potential energy is zero: $U = 0$.\n    *   The total energy of the particle is given by the relativistic energy formula: $E = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$, where $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total energy of the system is therefore $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n### 2. Apply the Conservation of Energy\n\nThe total energy of the system must be conserved. Therefore, the total energy at the maximum amplitude is equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n\n$E_{total} \\text{ (at x=A)} = E_{total} \\text{ (at x=0)}$\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n### 3. Solve for v_max\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\n\n1.  First, isolate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n2.  Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n3.  Solve for the term under the square root:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n4.  Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n5.  Rearrange to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n6.  Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option B. For comparison, the classical (non-relativistic) result is obtained by equating classical kinetic energy and potential energy: $\\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$, which gives $v_{max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (Option A). The relativistic treatment correctly accounts for the fact that the speed of light is the ultimate speed limit.\n\n<<<B>>>"
