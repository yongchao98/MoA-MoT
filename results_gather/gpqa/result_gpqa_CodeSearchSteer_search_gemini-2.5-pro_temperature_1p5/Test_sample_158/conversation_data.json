    "The analysis of the quasar's spectrum provides the key to determining its distance. The significant drop in flux at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm is a characteristic feature known as the Lyman-alpha forest, which is caused by the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. The peak wavelength corresponds to the redshifted Lyman-alpha emission line from the quasar itself.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the comoving distance:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Redshift (z)\n\nThe redshift of an astronomical object can be determined by comparing the observed wavelength (λ_observed) of a spectral line with its wavelength in the rest frame (λ_rest). The spectral feature observed is the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line of hydrogen.\n\n*   **Observed Wavelength (λ_observed):** 790 nm\n*   **Rest-frame Wavelength of Lyα (λ_rest):** The established laboratory wavelength for the Lyα transition is approximately 121.6 nm (or 1216 Å).\n\nThe formula to calculate the redshift (z) is:\n\n1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n1 + z = 790 nm / 121.6 nm ≈ 6.497\n\nz ≈ 6.497 - 1\n\n**z ≈ 5.5**\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Comoving Distance\n\nWith the redshift established, the comoving distance to the quasar can be calculated using the given parameters of the Lambda-CDM cosmological model.\n\n*   **Hubble Constant (H₀):** 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   **Matter Density Parameter (Ωₘ):** 0.3\n*   **Dark Energy Density Parameter (Ω\\_Λ):** 0.7\n*   **Redshift (z):** 5.5\n\nThe comoving distance in a flat universe is calculated by an integral that is most easily solved using a cosmology calculator. Using these specific parameters in a standard cosmological calculator, such as Ned Wright's Cosmology Calculator or the Astropy library in Python, yields the following result:\n\nThe comoving radial distance is approximately **8.0 Gpc**.\n\nThis result is derived from the standard model of cosmology and is a measure of the distance between the Earth and the quasar on a grid that expands with the universe, representing its position at the present time.\n\nBased on this calculation, the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth aligns with one of the provided options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
