    "In a universe with magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles), two of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified to describe their behavior. The standard forms of these equations in a vacuum effectively state that magnetic monopoles do not exist.\n\nHere are the specific changes:\n\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: This law, which describes the divergence of the magnetic field (∇ ⋅ B), would be the most direct and certain one to change. In our universe, its value is zero (∇ ⋅ B = 0), which mathematically means that magnetic field lines are always closed loops and there are no magnetic \"charges\" where field lines can begin or end. If magnetic monopoles existed, they would act as sources or sinks for the magnetic field, so the divergence of B would be proportional to the density of magnetic charge (ρm), similar to how the divergence of the electric field relates to electric charge.\n\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction**: This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (the curl of E, or ∇ × E). For the laws of electromagnetism to be fully symmetric, the existence of moving magnetic monopoles (a \"magnetic current,\" Jm) would require a modification to this law. A magnetic current would create a circulating electric field, just as an electric current creates a circulating magnetic field in the Ampère-Maxwell law. This modification would create a more symmetric set of equations between electricity and magnetism.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be different are the ones related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<A>>>"
