    "The multi-step synthesis transforms 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one into (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Step 1: Product 1 Formation**\n    The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide. Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol of the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether, forming 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one (Product 1).\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 2 Formation**\n    Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of catalytic acid. The ketone group of Product 1 reacts with the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This reaction yields N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide (Product 2).\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 3 Formation**\n    Product 2 undergoes a Shapiro reaction upon treatment with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature. In this reaction, two equivalents of the strong base are used to convert the tosylhydrazone into a vinyllithium intermediate, which eliminates nitrogen gas. The reaction regioselectivity is controlled by the deprotonation of the carbon alpha to the hydrazone, with the base typically removing the less sterically hindered proton. In this case, the proton at C6 is less hindered than the one at C2. The subsequent workup with aqueous ammonium chloride protonates the vinyllithium species to yield an alkene. This step effectively removes the original ketone functional group and forms a double bond, resulting in 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (Product 3).\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 4 Formation**\n    Product 3 is stirred with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere. This final step involves catalytic hydrogenation. The conditions are sufficient to reduce both carbon-carbon double bonds—the one in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl group—to single bonds. This converts the isopropenyl group into an isopropyl group and the cyclohexene into a cyclohexane ring. Concurrently, Pd/C catalysis with H2 is a standard method for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers, which removes the benzyl protecting group and regenerates the alcohol. The final product is therefore (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol (Product 4).\n\nThe relative 1,3-relationship between the hydroxymethyl and isopropenyl/isopropyl substituents is maintained throughout the entire sequence.\n\nThus, the final structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>"
