    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the relationship:\n\n1.  **Understand the initial relationship:** The problem states that the number of stars observed, let's call it `N`, varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. This is a statement about the density of stars in parallax space. We can write this as the number of stars per unit of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`.\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n2.  **Define the target relationship:** The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`) per unit range of distance. This is the number density of stars in real space, `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Relate distance and parallax:** Parallax and distance are inversely related. The relationship is:\n    `r = 1/plx` or `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Use the chain rule to transform the derivative:** To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative of parallax with respect to distance:** We need to find `d(plx)/dr` from the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(1/r)/dr = -1/r^2`\n\n6.  **Substitute the relationships:** Now we substitute the known proportionalities and the derivative into the chain rule equation. We are interested in the proportionality, so we can ignore the negative sign (which simply indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r^2)`\n\n7.  **Express the relationship entirely in terms of distance (r):** In the final step, substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression.\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance changes in proportion to `r^3`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
