    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nThe first step is the alpha-bromination of cyclohexanone. In this reaction, a bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. This results in the formation of **Product 1: 2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with a base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a classic ring-contraction reaction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate which then opens to form a five-membered ring. The product is a carboxylate salt, which upon acidification (assumed in a standard workup) yields **Product 2: cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nCyclopentanecarboxylic acid is a carboxylic acid. Treating a carboxylic acid with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard method to convert it into an acid chloride. Pyridine is typically used to neutralize the HCl byproduct. This reaction forms **Product 3: cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) is a mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without continuing the reduction to a primary alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced to **Product 4: cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze its structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Proton:** The hydrogen atom in the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. (1 distinct type)\n2.  **C1 Proton:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring to which the aldehyde group is attached (C1) is also in a unique environment. (1 distinct type)\n3.  **C2/C5 Protons:** The cyclopentane ring has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-CHO bond. This symmetry makes the protons on carbon 2 (C2) equivalent to the protons on carbon 5 (C5). However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogen atoms are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because one is cis (on the same side) and one is trans (on the opposite side) relative to the aldehyde group. Thus, the four protons on C2 and C5 represent two distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. (2 distinct types)\n4.  **C3/C4 Protons:** Similarly, the protons on carbon 3 (C3) are equivalent to the protons on carbon 4 (C4) due to the plane of symmetry. Like the C2/C5 protons, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. Therefore, the four protons on C3 and C4 represent another two distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. (2 distinct types)\n\nIn total, the number of chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms is the sum of all the unique sets: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
