    "This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The magnetic moment of a particle in an external magnetic field will precess about the direction of the field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. The magnetic moment is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin component along any axis is quantized, with possible values of +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Since the moment is aligned with the field, the particle is in the \"spin-up\" state along the Z-axis, denoted as `|+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**: The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian of the system, which describes its energy, is given by `H = -μ · B`. For the new field, the Hamiltonian is `H = -γ * B * Sy`, where `Sy` is the spin operator for the Y-direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The state at a time `t` after the switch is given by `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`, where `|ψ(0)⟩` is the initial state `|+z⟩`.\n\n4.  **Larmor Precession**: The new Hamiltonian causes the spin to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, given by `ω = γ * B`.\n\n5.  **Oscillation of `<Sz>`**: We are interested in the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz> = γ<Sz>`. As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis in the XZ-plane, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The initial spin was entirely along the Z-axis. As it rotates away from the Z-axis and then back towards it, the value of `<Sz>` changes.\n\nThe frequency of this oscillation is precisely the frequency of the Larmor precession. The angular frequency `ω` of this oscillation is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength `B` and the gyromagnetic ratio `γ`. The calculation shows that the angular frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
