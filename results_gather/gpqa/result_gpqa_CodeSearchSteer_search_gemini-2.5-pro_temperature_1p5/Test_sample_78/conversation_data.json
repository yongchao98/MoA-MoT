    "To identify Compound X, we must first deduce the structure of the reaction product from the provided NMR data and then determine which of the possible starting materials would yield this product under the given reaction conditions.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Product from NMR Data**\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Spectrum:** The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically a **ketone**. The signals in the range of δ 126.9-144.1 ppm correspond to sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic and vinyl). The two aliphatic carbon signals at **δ 21.3 ppm** and **δ 28.4 ppm** are typical for methyl groups. The presence of 9 signals for 11 carbons implies some molecular symmetry. The signals at δ 126.9 (2C) and 129.1 (2C) strongly suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows two methyl singlets at **δ 2.28 (3H)** and **δ 2.31 (3H)**. The signals in the aromatic/vinylic region from δ 6.75-7.71 ppm integrate to a total of six protons. The two doublets integrating to two protons each (**δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**) are characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The remaining two signals, **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**, are indicative of two protons on a C=C double bond, likely in a *trans* configuration.\n\n*   **Structure Elucidation:** Based on the evidence, the product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone containing a *p*-tolyl group. The structure is **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    *   The two methyl singlets correspond to the acetyl methyl group (CH₃-C=O) and the tolyl methyl group (CH₃-C₆H₄-).\n    *   The two vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) give rise to the two doublets at δ 6.75 and δ 7.68.\n    *   The para-substituted ring protons appear as two doublets at δ 7.08 and δ 7.71.\n    *   This structure, with the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O, is consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n### **2. Identification of Compound X**\n\nThe reaction involves heating Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O), an epoxide, with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base. This suggests a base-catalyzed rearrangement or isomerization reaction. We must now evaluate which of the given options for Compound X could rearrange to form (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   **A) 2-styrylepoxide:** This compound has the formula C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match the given formula C₁₁H₁₂O.\n*   **B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound (C₁₁H₁₂O) contains a phenyl group, not a *p*-tolyl group. It is impossible to form the *p*-tolyl product from this starting material under the specified conditions.\n*   **D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This compound (C₁₁H₁₂O) also contains a phenyl group instead of the required *p*-tolyl group.\n\n*   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** This compound, also known as 2-(p-tolylethenyl)oxirane, has the correct molecular formula, C₁₁H₁₂O. Its carbon skeleton, `(p-Tolyl)-CH=CH-C₂H₃O`, perfectly matches the skeleton required for the product, `(p-Tolyl)-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`. The reaction is an isomerization of a vinyloxirane to an α,β-unsaturated ketone. Such rearrangements of epoxides to ketones, sometimes referred to as Meinwald rearrangements, can be mediated by bases like DABCO. The process involves the conversion of the epoxide group `-[CH-O-CH₂]` into a methyl ketone group `-CO-CH₃`.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, which rearranges to form 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n<<<C>>>"
