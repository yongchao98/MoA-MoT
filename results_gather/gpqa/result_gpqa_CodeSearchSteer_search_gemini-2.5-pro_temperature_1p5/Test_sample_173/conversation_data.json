    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the initial parameters:\n*   Initial rest-mass energy, `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n\n### 2. Determine the properties of the fragments:\n*   Let the rest-masses of the two fragments be `m1` and `m2`. We are given that one is twice as massive as the other, so let `m1 = 2 * m2`. `m1` is the more massive fragment.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   We can express this in terms of rest-mass energy: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`.\n*   Substituting the given values: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Now we solve for the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, it follows that `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n    *   `2 * m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    *   `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Energy Released (Q-value):\n*   The energy released in the fission, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments, is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = (M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n*   By conservation of momentum, the initial momentum (zero) must equal the final total momentum. This means the fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude: `p1 = p2`.\n*   Therefore, `m1 * v1 = m2 * v2`.\n*   The ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n    *   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p1^2 / (2*m1)) / (p2^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`.\n    *   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   `T1_classical = (1/2) * T2_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`:\n    *   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1:\n*   The relativistic relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Total energy is the sum of kinetic and rest-mass energy: `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Substituting this gives `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding this, we get `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n*   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   Therefore: `T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`.\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Let's substitute this into the equation:\n    *   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396 * T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n*   Now, we simplify by canceling the `T1^2` terms:\n    *   `396 * T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n    *   `(396 + 204) * T1 = 603`\n    *   `600 * T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n    *   `T1 = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference:\n*   Difference = (Correct T1) - (Classical T1)\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
