    "### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nBased on the information provided, we can deduce the structure and formula of the unknown compound step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The ¹H NMR shows two signals for aromatic hydrogens, which typically indicates a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern on a benzene ring. This accounts for a **C₆H₄** fragment.\n\n2.  **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This means the molecule contains two oxygen atoms, accounting for the **O₂** in the formula.\n\n3.  **Vinyl and Methyl Groups (¹H NMR):**\n    *   There are two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-). One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split into a doublet by its vinyl neighbor. The other vinyl proton is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group. This fragment accounts for **C₃H₅** and one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   There is a second methyl group signal (-CH₃). Since the spectrum has no signals for methylene (-CH₂-) groups, this methyl group must be part of the ester, either as a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). This accounts for a **-CH₃** fragment.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nNow, we assemble these fragments to form a complete molecule that is a di-substituted aromatic ester. There are two primary possibilities that fit all the data:\n\n*   **Possibility 1: Methyl 4-propenylbenzoate**\n    *   Fragments: A 4-propenyl group (-C₃H₅) and a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃) are attached to the benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n    *   Formula Calculation: C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O₂ = **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n*   **Possibility 2: 4-propenylphenyl acetate**\n    *   Fragments: A 4-propenyl group (-C₃H₅) and an acetate group (-O-CO-CH₃) are attached to the benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n    *   Formula Calculation: C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O₂ = **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nBoth plausible structures consistent with all the given spectral information have the same molecular formula: C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Evaluating Other Options\n\n*   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** These formulas contain more hydrogen atoms, indicating fewer double bonds or rings (a lower degree of unsaturation). The presence of both an aromatic ring and a vinyl group is confirmed by the NMR, which contradicts the degree of unsaturation calculated for C₁₁H₁₄O₂. Constructing a molecule for C₁₂H₁₄O₂ that fits all NMR criteria (especially the \"no -CH₂ groups\" rule) is not feasible.\n*   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** This formula has a higher degree of unsaturation than C₁₁H₁₂O₂, implying an additional ring or double bond, which is not supported by the provided NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that logically fits the detailed spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
