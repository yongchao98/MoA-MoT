    "### Detailed Analysis\n\n**Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position. The \"(S)\" designation indicates its specific stereoconfiguration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH, LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The incoming hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible stereoisomers for the newly formed alcohol group (R or S).\n    *   Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged ((S) configuration), the two products will be (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have one identical stereocenter (C5) and one different stereocenter (C3). Diastereomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is also a reducing agent capable of reducing ketones to alcohols. The problem specifies excess NaBH₄, ensuring both ketone groups are reduced. The reaction produces pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are **enantiomers** of each other (non-superimposable mirror images).\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 1 from Rxn I)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 2 from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer 1 from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer 2 from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Meso compound from Rxn II)\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   It can separate **diastereomers** because they have different physical properties, including polarity.\n*   It **cannot** separate **enantiomers** because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Analyzing the mixture:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will separate from each other, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity, so it will appear as a separate, single peak (**1 peak**).\n    *   The two enantiomers from Reaction II will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak (**1 peak**).\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different and have a different molecular weight than the products from Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), ensuring they will all separate from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (meso from Rxn II) + 1 (enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC**\n\n*   HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is specifically designed to separate enantiomers. It achieves this by creating a chiral environment where enantiomers interact differently, leading to different retention times.\n*   It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   Analyzing the mixture:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated (**2 peaks**).\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II will be separated from all other compounds (**1 peak**).\n    *   The two enantiomers from Reaction II, which co-eluted on the normal-phase column, will now be resolved into two separate peaks (**2 peaks**).\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (meso from Rxn II) + 2 (enantiomers from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
