    "### Analysis of the Decay Process\n\nThe nuclear decay in question is the transformation of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν). Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. According to the principle of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. This implies that the muon and the neutrino will travel in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n\n### Energy and Momentum Conservation\n\nThe decay process must also adhere to the law of conservation of energy. The total energy before the decay, which is the rest energy of the stationary pion, must equal the sum of the total energies of the product particles after the decay. The rest masses provided are 139.6 MeV/c² for the pion and 105.7 MeV/c² for the muon. The muon neutrino is considered to be massless for this calculation, which is a standard and accurate approximation in particle physics.\n\n### Calculation of Kinetic Energies\n\nUsing the principles of conservation of energy and momentum, we can derive a formula to calculate the kinetic energy (KE) of the muon. The formula is:\n\n**KE_μ = (m_π² - m_μ²) / (2 * m_π)**\n\nWhere:\n*   **KE_μ** is the kinetic energy of the muon.\n*   **m_π** is the rest mass of the pion (139.6 MeV/c²).\n*   **m_μ** is the rest mass of the muon (105.7 MeV/c²).\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nKE_μ = ( (139.6 MeV)² - (105.7 MeV)² ) / (2 * 139.6 MeV)\nKE_μ = (19488.16 MeV² - 11172.49 MeV²) / (279.2 MeV)\nKE_μ = 8315.67 MeV² / 279.2 MeV\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV**\n\nThe total energy released in the decay is the difference between the pion's rest mass and the muon's rest mass, which is 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. This energy is distributed as the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν) can then be found by subtracting the muon's kinetic energy from the total energy released:\n\nKE_ν = Total Energy Released - KE_μ\nKE_ν = 33.9 MeV - 4.12 MeV\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nThese calculated values for the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This result is consistent with experimental measurements and established physics models for pion decay.\n\n<<<D>>>"
