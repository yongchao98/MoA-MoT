    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the electromagnetic field at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$, generated by a charge $q$ that was at a \"retarded\" position at an earlier time $t_r$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined implicitly by the condition that the time difference $t - t_r$ is equal to the time it takes for light to travel from the source's retarded position to the observation point. Using the notation provided in the question:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$, where $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| = |\\vec{d}|$.\n\nThe derivation of the potentials from Maxwell's equations accounts for the fact that the volume element of the moving charge appears compressed or expanded to the observer, which gives rise to a correction factor in the denominator of the potentials.\n\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})}$\n\nThese can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{qc}{(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nIt's also a known relationship that for a moving point charge, the vector potential is related to the scalar potential by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$. Using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_o \\mu_o)$, we can verify that the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is consistent with the expression for $V$.\n\nComparing these derived forms with the given options:\n*   **A)** Has a plus sign in the denominator, which corresponds to advanced potentials (non-causal).\n*   **B)** Matches the derived expressions for the retarded (causal) scalar and vector potentials exactly.\n*   **C) and D)** Use the static Coulomb potential form for V, which is incorrect as it does not account for retardation effects due to the charge's motion.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
