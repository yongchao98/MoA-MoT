    "To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images. A charge *q* is placed at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R* (where *d* > *R*).\n\nThe presence of the charge *q* induces an opposite charge on the surface of the conducting sphere. To find the potential and forces, we can replace the sphere with an \"image\" charge, *q'*, located inside the sphere.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1.  **Determine the image charge (q') and its location (b):**\n    For a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge *q'* is given by:\n    q' = - (R/d) * q\n\n    This image charge is located at a distance *b* from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to the charge *q*:\n    b = R² / d\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from an infinite distance to the distance *d* from the center of the sphere. This work is done against the electric field created by the induced charge on the sphere, which is equivalent to the field of the image charge *q'*.\n\n    The potential at the location of charge *q* due to the image charge *q'* is:\n    V' = k * q' / (d - b)\n    where *k* is Coulomb's constant (1 / 4πε₀), and (d - b) is the distance between the real charge and the image charge.\n\n    Substituting the expressions for *q'* and *b*:\n    d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²) / d\n    V' = k * [-(R/d) * q] / [(d² - R²) / d]\n    V' = - k * R * q / (d² - R²)\n\n    The potential energy *U* of a charge *q* in a potential *V'* is given by U = (1/2)qV'. The factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge and its field are created as the real charge is brought in, so the work done is integrated from zero field to the final field.\n\n    Therefore, the net potential energy of the system is:\n    U = (1/2) * q * V'\n    U = (1/2) * q * [-k * R * q / (d² - R²)]\n    U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)\n\nBy comparing this result with the given options, we can see that it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
