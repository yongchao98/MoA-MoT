    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Product 1\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of KOH.\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). This is a rigid, caged hydrocarbon with bromine atoms at two tertiary bridgehead positions.\n*   **Reagents:** KOH is a strong base, and the high temperature (240°C) suggests an elimination reaction. However, due to Bredt's rule, forming a double bond at the bridgehead of the rigid adamantane cage is highly unfavorable.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **IR spectrum:** A characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone. Ring strain in polycyclic systems can increase the C=O stretching frequency, so this value is consistent with a ketone within a strained ring system.\n    *   **¹H NMR spectrum:** 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The total integration (2+10+2=14) shows that no hydrogens have been lost. The molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** The formation of a ketone from a dihalide under these conditions points towards a skeletal rearrangement. The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with strong bases is known to proceed via a Favorskii-type rearrangement. This involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate which is unstable and undergoes cleavage. In this specific case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane rearranges to form proto-adamantan-4-one.\n\n**Product 1 is proto-adamantan-4-one.** This structure is consistent with the spectral data. The molecule is symmetric, which simplifies the NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Product 2\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (proto-adamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Aluminum isopropoxide is the classic reagent for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** The ketone group in proto-adamantan-4-one is reduced to a hydroxyl group.\n\n**Product 2 is proto-adamantan-4-ol.**\n\n### Step 3: Identifying Product 3\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (proto-adamantan-4-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reagent:** This two-step process is a standard ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** While proto-adamantan-4-ol itself does not have a C=C double bond, the name \"proto-adamantane\" signifies that it is a strained isomer of adamantane. Upon ozonolysis, a C-C bond in the strained four-membered ring of the proto-adamantane skeleton is cleaved. The ozonolysis of saturated, strained polycyclic hydrocarbons is a known reaction. Specifically, the C2-C3 bond of the proto-adamantane framework is oxidized and cleaved. The subsequent reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide yields two aldehyde groups.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** The resulting product is a bicyclic dialdehyde: bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde. The structure has a plane of symmetry.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\n*   **Structure:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde.\n*   **Task:** Determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding the aldehyde protons, -CHO, which would exchange with D₂O and are often broad singlets).\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In the absence of the aldehydic protons, the most deshielded protons are the methine hydrogens on the carbons bearing the aldehyde groups (C3 and C7). These two protons are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. Let's analyze the coupling for the proton at C3.\n*   **Coupling Analysis (Splitting Pattern):** The splitting of the C3 proton is determined by the number of adjacent non-equivalent protons.\n    1.  The C3 proton is adjacent to the two protons on C2 (let's call them H2a and H2b). These two protons will split the C3-H signal. Since they are diastereotopic (not equivalent), they could have different coupling constants, but often in such systems, they couple similarly, resulting in a triplet.\n    2.  The C3 proton is also adjacent to the two protons on C4 (H4a and H4b). These two protons will also split the C3-H signal, resulting in another triplet.\n*   **Combined Pattern:** The C3 proton is coupled to two sets of two equivalent protons. Therefore, its signal will be split into a triplet by the C2 protons, and each peak of that triplet will be further split into another triplet by the C4 protons.\n\n**The resulting coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets.**\n\n<<<C>>>"
