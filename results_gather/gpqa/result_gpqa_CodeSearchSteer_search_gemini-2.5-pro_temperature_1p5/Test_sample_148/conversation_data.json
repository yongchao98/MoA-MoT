    "Here is a breakdown of the observations and an evaluation of each option:\n\n### Analysis of the Experimental Data\n1.  **Compound Type:** A chemically synthesized small peptidic compound. This is significant because peptides contain amide bonds, which have unique properties.\n2.  **Â¹H NMR Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is correct (1H). This doubling of a signal for a single proton, without it being due to spin-spin coupling, indicates the presence of two different chemical environments for that proton. Since the rest of the spectrum is largely as expected, this suggests the compound exists as a mixture of two very similar species. The roughly equal integrals mean these two species are present in nearly equal amounts.\n3.  **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):** The analysis separates two components, as shown by the two distinct peaks of equal intensity. Crucially, both peaks give the exact same mass spectrum, which corresponds to the expected molecule. This confirms the presence of two species that have the same mass (isomers) and are present in equal quantities.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard achiral NMR solvent and on a standard (non-chiral) LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single set of NMR peaks and a single LC peak. This option contradicts both the NMR and LC-MS observations.\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would be a different molecule with a different chemical formula and therefore a different mass. The LC-MS data clearly shows both components have the *same mass* as the target molecule. This option is inconsistent with the mass spectrometry results.\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This suggests a synthesis error, likely leading to a molecule with an incorrect covalent structure (e.g., an extra amino acid). Such a product would have a different mass from the expected molecule, which again is contradicted by the mass spectrometry data.\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. Unlike enantiomers, diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties and can be distinguished by standard NMR and separated by standard chromatography.\n    *   In the context of a peptide, a very common source of diastereomerism is **atropisomerism** due to restricted rotation around an amide (peptide) bond. This creates stable *cis* and *trans* conformers (also called rotamers).\n    *   These *cis/trans* isomers are diastereomers. The atoms in each isomer are in slightly different chemical environments. This perfectly explains the doubled peak for the alpha-proton in the NMR spectrum.\n    *   Because they are distinct compounds with different 3D shapes, they can be separated by LC, explaining the two peaks.\n    *   Since they are isomers, they have the identical chemical formula and mass, which is consistent with the LC-MS finding.\n    *   The slow interconversion between these isomers on the NMR and chromatographic timescales results in the observation of two distinct species.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe observation of doubled NMR peaks and two separable LC peaks of the same mass is a classic signature of a mixture of slowly interconverting diastereomers. In a peptide, this is most commonly caused by cis-trans isomerism around an amide bond, particularly one involving a proline residue, though it can occur with other amino acids as well.\n\n<<<D>>>"
