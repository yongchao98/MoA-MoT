    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the goal is to inactivate the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is most effectively achieved by a \"loss-of-function\" mutation that prevents the production of a functional protein. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein-coding sequence.\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins `5’-ATG TTT CTC...`, which codes for the amino acid sequence Methionine-Phenylalanine-Leucine.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTC TAC...` contains a change in the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid is substituted for another. While this could potentially disrupt protein function, it is not guaranteed. Many missense mutations have little to no effect, or only partially reduce function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTC TAA...` contains a change in the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`. On the corresponding mRNA, this would be UAA. UAA is a **stop codon**, which signals the end of protein synthesis. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. A nonsense mutation results in a prematurely shortened, truncated protein that is typically non-functional, especially when it occurs so early in the gene. This is a classic example of a loss-of-function mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTT TAC...` has a change in the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, similar to Mutant 1. It results in a single amino acid substitution, which may or may not eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...` results from a deletion of the `GGT` codon compared to the original `...GCT GGT ACT...`. This is an **in-frame deletion**, which removes a single amino acid (Glycine) but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid, which could harm its function but is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) is the most probable type of mutation to completely disrupt protein function and, therefore, eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. It stops protein production near the very beginning, ensuring the resulting polypeptide is too short to perform its intended role.\n\n<<<C>>>"
