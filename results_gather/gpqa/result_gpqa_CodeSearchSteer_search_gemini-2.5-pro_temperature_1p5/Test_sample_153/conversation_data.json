    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound with its most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** A peak is observed at m/z = 158. The mass difference of 2 units (158 - 156) and the relative intensity ratio of the M+2 peak to the M+ peak (32%, which is approximately 1:3) is a characteristic pattern for a molecule containing one chlorine atom. This is due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (4-chlorobenzoic acid, phenyl chloroformate, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, and 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight that matches this data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded, typically as a dimer.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of the extremely broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This makes 4-chlorobenzoic acid (A) and 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C) the most likely candidates. Phenyl chloroformate (B) lacks the O-H group, and its carbonyl stretch would be at a higher frequency. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D) has an -OH and a C=O group, but the O-H peak of a phenol is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid, and the aldehyde and phenol combination does not fit the overall pattern as well as a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** The signal at such a high chemical shift (downfield) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Its integration as one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s) are consistent with this assignment.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The two signals in the aromatic region provide crucial information about the substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   There are two distinct signals, not four, which indicates a degree of symmetry in the molecule.\n    *   Both signals are doublets (d), and each integrates to two protons (2H).\n    *   This specific pattern—two doublets, each representing two protons—is the classic signature of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para*-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry equivalent to the two on the other side.\n*   **Evaluating Remaining Options:**\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a *para* substitution pattern. It possesses a plane of symmetry that results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are shifted downfield (8.02 ppm), while the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are at a slightly higher field (7.72 ppm). This perfectly matches the observed spectrum.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *ortho*-substituted. It has no such symmetry, and all four aromatic protons are in chemically different environments. This would lead to four separate signals, not two.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule is also unsymmetrically substituted and would show three distinct signals for its three aromatic protons.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining all the spectral evidence, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the only structure that fits all the data. The MS shows a chlorinated compound with a mass of 156. The IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm confirm a carboxylic acid. The aromatic signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum definitively point to a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n<<<A>>>"
