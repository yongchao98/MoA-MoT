    "The reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst is an olefin self-metathesis. This reaction involves the cutting and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds. Since the starting material is a racemic mixture, it contains equal amounts of two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\nThe general form of this self-metathesis reaction is:\n2 R-CH=CH₂ → R-CH=CH-R + CH₂=CH₂ (ethene)\n\nIn this specific case, the 'R' group is a chiral sec-butyl group, -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃. The reaction will produce 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene and ethene. The question asks for the number of possible products, excluding ethene. We must consider the stereochemistry of the products.\n\nThree types of reactions can occur in the racemic mixture:\n1.  **Reaction between two (R)-isomers:** This \"homo-coupling\" produces (3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. The newly formed double bond at the C4 position can be in either an *E* or *Z* configuration. This results in two distinct, chiral diastereomers:\n    *   (*E*)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    *   (*Z*)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n\n2.  **Reaction between two (S)-isomers:** This reaction is analogous to the first and produces the enantiomers of the (R,R) products. These are also two distinct, chiral molecules:\n    *   (*E*)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    *   (*Z*)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n\n3.  **Reaction between an (R)-isomer and an (S)-isomer:** This \"cross-coupling\" produces (3R,6S)- or (3S,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Again, both *E* and *Z* isomers of the double bond can form.\n    *   The *E*-isomer, (*E*)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, possesses a center of inversion, which makes it an achiral *meso* compound.\n    *   The *Z*-isomer, (*Z*)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, is chiral. Its reaction will produce a racemic mixture of (*Z*)-(3R,6S) and (*Z*)-(3S,6R) enantiomers.\n\nIn total, counting every unique stereoisomer gives: 2 (from R+R) + 2 (from S+S) + 1 (*meso*) + 2 (from the racemic Z-product) = 7 distinct chemical compounds.\n\nHowever, multiple-choice chemistry questions sometimes count pairs of enantiomers, which are chemically identical in a non-chiral environment and cannot be separated by standard chromatography, as a single \"product\". Let's re-evaluate the products based on this interpretation:\n1.  The (R,R) and (S,S) *E*-isomers form an enantiomeric pair. This counts as **one product**.\n2.  The (R,R) and (S,S) *Z*-isomers form another enantiomeric pair. This counts as **one product**.\n3.  The *E*-(3R,6S) isomer is a single *meso* compound. This is diastereomeric to all other products and is counted as **one product**.\n4.  The *Z*-(3R,6S) and *Z*-(3S,6R) isomers form a third enantiomeric pair. This counts as **one product**.\n\nUnder this common interpretation, the total number of separable products is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
