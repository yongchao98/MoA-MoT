    "To determine if two energy levels can be clearly distinguished, we must consider the energy-time uncertainty principle. This principle dictates that a quantum state's finite lifetime introduces an inherent uncertainty, or \"broadening,\" in its energy level. This is often referred to as the natural linewidth.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** For energy and time, the principle is expressed as ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. A quantum state that exists for only a short time cannot have a precisely defined energy.\n*   **Natural Linewidth:** The energy uncertainty (ΔE) is also known as the natural linewidth (Γ) of the spectral line. To resolve two distinct energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than this linewidth. The shorter the lifetime of a state, the broader its energy uncertainty.\n*   **Resolvability Condition:** To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, E1 and E2, the energy separation |E1 - E2| must be larger than the energy uncertainty of each state. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy uncertainty, thus posing the stricter condition for resolvability.\n\n### Calculation\n\n1.  **Identify the Limiting State:** We are given two lifetimes:\n    *   τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    The state with the shorter lifetime (τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s) will have the greater energy uncertainty (ΔE1) and is, therefore, the limiting factor for resolving the two levels.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty:** Using the energy-time uncertainty principle, we can calculate the minimum energy uncertainty for the first state. A common and practical form of the relation for this purpose is ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n    *   The value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n    *   Calculating ΔE1:\n        ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n3.  **Compare with Options:** The energy difference between the two levels must be greater than this uncertainty, ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV, for the levels to be clearly resolved. Let's examine the given options:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is greater than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly the energy difference in option A is large enough to overcome the natural linewidth of the shorter-lived state.\n\n<<<A>>>"
