    "### System_1 Found to Be Approximately 0.4 Times the Mass of System_2\n\nBy analyzing the observational data from two binary star systems, astronomers have determined the ratio of their total masses. The calculations reveal that system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2. This value corresponds to option B) ~ 0.4 in the provided choices.\n\nThe conclusion was reached by applying the principles of orbital mechanics to the specific properties of each system. For a double-lined spectroscopic and eclipsing binary system, the total mass (M) can be calculated from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars (K1 and K2). Since the systems exhibit eclipses, their orbital inclination is assumed to be approximately 90 degrees, simplifying the calculations. The relationship is given by the formula:\n\nM ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\nThis formula is derived from Kepler's Third Law, where the semi-major axis of the orbit is expressed in terms of the observable radial velocities and the period.\n\nFor system_1, the following data was used:\n*   Orbital Period (P1): 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K1_1, K1_2): 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n\nFor system_2, the data was:\n*   Orbital Period (P2): 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K2_1, K2_2): 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, the ratio of their masses (M1/M2) was computed. The constant of proportionality cancels out in the ratio, leading to the following calculation:\n\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³] / [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³]\nM1 / M2 = [2 * (10 + 5)³] / [1 * (15 + 10)³]\nM1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM1 / M2 = [2 * 3375] /\nM1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThis result indicates that system_1 has approximately 43.2% of the mass of system_2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
