    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of the substituent on each benzene ring.\n\nThe six substances are:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is a weakly activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a deactivating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is a weakly activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n### Step 1: Separate into Ortho-, Para- and Meta-directing Groups\n\nFirst, we can separate the compounds into two categories: those that will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer (ortho-, para-directors) and those that will produce very little (meta-directors).\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These will have the lowest para-isomer yields. They primarily direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. This group includes Nitrobenzene (4), Ethyl benzoate (2), and Benzoic acid (6).\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directors:** These will have the highest para-isomer yields. This group includes Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), and Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n### Step 2: Order the Meta-directors by Para-isomer Yield\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of the para-isomer generally decreases as the deactivating strength of the substituent increases.\n\n*   **(4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. During nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution), it yields only a trace (0-5%) of the para-isomer. Bromination requires harsh conditions, and it produces the meta-isomer as the chief product. This compound will have the lowest para-yield.\n*   **(2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate) & (6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** Both the ester and carboxylic acid groups are deactivating and meta-directing. For the nitration of ethyl benzoate, the para-isomer yield is about 5%. Data for the bromination of benzoic acid indicates it forms the m-bromobenzoic acid, implying a very low para-yield. In terms of deactivating strength, -COOH is generally considered stronger than -COOR. Therefore, we can expect the para-yield for benzoic acid to be lower than for ethyl benzoate.\n\nThe order of increasing para-yield for the meta-directors is: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Ortho-, Para-directors by Para-isomer Yield\n\nFor ortho-, para-directing groups, both positions are favored, but the ratio between them is affected by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will hinder the approach of the electrophile (bromine) to the adjacent ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **(1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 group is relatively small. In bromination, toluene typically yields about 36.8% of the para-isomer.\n*   **(5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 group is bulkier than -CH3. This increased steric hindrance disfavors ortho-substitution, making the para-isomer more predominant compared to toluene. For bromination in trifluoroacetic acid, ethylbenzene gives 83.2% para-isomer.\n*   **(3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl group, while deactivating overall, is ortho-, para-directing. Halogens are known to produce a very high yield of the para-isomer due to a combination of electronic and steric factors. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene gives 70% para-product. Bromination of chlorobenzene also shows high para-selectivity, often over 95%.\n\nComparing the ortho-, para-directors:\n*   Para yield (Ethylbenzene) > Para yield (Toluene) due to sterics.\n*   Para yield (Chlorobenzene) is typically very high, exceeding that of simple alkylbenzenes.\n\nThe order of increasing para-yield for the ortho-, para-directors is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Orders\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 (Nitrobenzene) < 6 (Benzoic acid) < 2 (Ethyl benzoate) < 1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene) < 3 (Chlorobenzene)**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
