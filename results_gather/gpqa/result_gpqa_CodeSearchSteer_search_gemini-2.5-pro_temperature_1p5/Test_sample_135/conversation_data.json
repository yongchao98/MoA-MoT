    "To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f(r)** within a sphere of radius R, we can use the Divergence Theorem. The vector field is defined as having a magnitude of 1/r² and pointing radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this is expressed as **f(r)** = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the surface integral (or flux) of the field over the closed surface S that encloses the volume.\n∫∫∫ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮∮ (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of **f(r)** = (1/r²) **r̂** yields zero for all points where r > 0. However, the field is undefined at the origin (r=0), creating a singularity. This singularity is crucial. Because of this singularity, we cannot simply conclude the integral is zero.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem is a powerful tool for this problem. It allows us to calculate the volume integral by instead computing the flux of the vector field through the surface of the sphere of radius R.\n\nThe differential surface area element d**S** on the surface of a sphere of radius R is given by d**S** = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**.\n\nThe flux is the surface integral of the dot product **f** ⋅ d**S**. On the surface of the sphere, r = R, so the vector field is **f(R)** = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n\nThe dot product is:\n**f(R)** ⋅ d**S** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ [R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**]\n= (1/R²) * R² * sin(θ) dθ dφ\n= sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nNow, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for the polar angle θ are from 0 to π, and for the azimuthal angle φ are from 0 to 2π.\n\nFlux = ∫ (from φ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nFirst, integrating with respect to θ:\n∫ (from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] (from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = 1 - (-1) = 2.\n\nNext, integrating the result with respect to φ:\n∫ (from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = [2φ] (from 0 to 2π) = 2(2π) - 0 = 4π.\n\nThe value of the flux integral is 4π. According to the Divergence Theorem, this is also the value of the volume integral of the divergence of the field.\n\nThe apparent contradiction of the divergence being zero everywhere except the origin, yet the integral being non-zero, is resolved by understanding that the divergence at the origin is a Dirac delta function. The integral of ∇ ⋅ (**r̂**/r²) over any volume containing the origin is 4π.\n\n<<<A>>>"
