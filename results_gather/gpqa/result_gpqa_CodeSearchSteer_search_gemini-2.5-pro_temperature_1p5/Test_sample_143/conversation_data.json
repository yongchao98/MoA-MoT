    "This problem requires calculating the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X, given its production energy, mass, and decay width.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical quantities and constants:**\n    *   Production energy (Eₓ): 8 GeV\n    *   Mass (mₓ): 1.2 GeV\n    *   Decay width (Γₓ): 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV\n    *   Reduced Planck constant times the speed of light (ħc): A commonly used value in particle physics is approximately 197.3 MeV·fm (or 0.1973 GeV·fm). 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\n2.  **Determine the formula for the mean decay distance (L):**\n    The mean decay distance is the average distance a particle travels before it decays. It is given by the formula L = γ * β * c * τ, where:\n    *   τ is the proper lifetime of the particle in its rest frame.\n    *   γ is the Lorentz factor, which accounts for time dilation.\n    *   β = v/c is the particle's velocity as a fraction of the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Calculate the proper lifetime (τ):**\n    The proper lifetime is related to the decay width by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: τ = ħ / Γₓ.\n\n4.  **Combine the formulas:**\n    Substituting τ into the distance formula gives L = γ * β * c * (ħ / Γₓ).\n    This can be rearranged as L = (γ * β) * (ħc / Γₓ).\n\n5.  **Calculate the term γβ:**\n    The product γβ can be expressed in terms of the particle's energy (E) and mass (m). The total energy E = γmc², and the momentum p = γmv = γβmc.\n    Therefore, γβ = p/m (in units where c=1).\n    The momentum p can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    Solving for pc: pc = √(E² - (mc²)²)\n    So, γβ = (pc) / (mc²) = √(E² - m²) / m (using energy units for mass, where c=1).\n\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    *   pc = √(8² - 1.2²) GeV = √(64 - 1.44) GeV = √62.56 GeV ≈ 7.909 GeV\n    *   γβ = √62.56 / 1.2 ≈ 6.591\n\n6.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (L):**\n    Now, substitute the values into the combined formula:\n    L = (√(E² - m²) / m) * (ħc / Γₓ)\n    L = (√62.56 / 1.2) * (0.1973 GeV·fm / 0.320 GeV)\n    L ≈ 6.591 * (0.61656 GeV·fm / GeV)\n    L ≈ 4.0645 fm\n\n7.  **Convert to meters:**\n    Since 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.0645 * 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated value of 4.0645 * 10⁻¹⁵ m is extremely close to option A. The minor difference can be attributed to the specific value of the constant ħc used to generate the problem's options.\n\nA) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nB) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nC) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nD) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\n\nThe calculation clearly supports option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
