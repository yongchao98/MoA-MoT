    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we must analyze how mass and composition affect a planet's density. Density is the measure of mass per unit of volume. A key principle is gravitational compression: as a planet's mass increases, its gravity compresses the material it is made of, leading to a higher overall density.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the given options:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This describes Earth itself, which has a known average density of about 5.51 g/cm³. This serves as our baseline for comparison.\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being approximately 5.5 g/cm³, which is virtually the same as Earth's.\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** For a planet with the same raw materials as Earth but less mass, the gravitational force will be weaker. This results in less self-compression, meaning the materials are not packed as tightly. Consequently, its average density will be lower than Earth's.\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet, often categorized as a \"Super-Earth,\" has the same initial composition as Earth but significantly more mass. The immense gravitational force of this mass would cause substantial compression of its interior. This gravitational squeezing packs the same material into a proportionally smaller volume, resulting in a significantly higher average density. Studies and models of super-Earths confirm that for a given rocky composition, density increases with mass due to this compression.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy comparing the scenarios, the planet with five times the mass of Earth (c) will experience the most significant gravitational compression, leading to the highest density. Planets (a) and (b) have densities roughly equal to Earth's, while planet (d) would be less dense than Earth.\n\n<<<A>>>"
