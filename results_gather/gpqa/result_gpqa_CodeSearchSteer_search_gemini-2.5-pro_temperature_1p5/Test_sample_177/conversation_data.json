    "To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we first need to analyze the dimensions of each component in the given interaction Lagrangian.\n\n### 1. Determining Mass Dimensions\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action S is dimensionless. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density L over four-dimensional spacetime: `S = ∫ d⁴x L`.\n\n*   The spacetime differential `d⁴x` has a mass dimension of `[d⁴x] = -4`.\n*   For the action `S` to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of `[L] = 4`.\n\nThe interaction Lagrangian is given by:\n`L_int = κ * ψ̄ * σ_μν * ψ * F^μν`\n\nNow, let's find the mass dimension of each term in a 4-dimensional spacetime:\n*   **Fermion field ψ**: The kinetic term for a fermion is `L_fermion = ψ̄(iγ^μ∂_μ - m)ψ`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, given `[∂_μ] = 1`, the fermion field `ψ` must have a mass dimension of `[ψ] = 3/2`. Consequently, `[ψ̄] = 3/2` as well.\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor F^μν**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_EM = -1/4 * F_μν * F^μν`. For this to have a mass dimension of 4, `F^μν` must have a mass dimension of `[F^μν] = 2`.\n*   **Sigma matrix σ_μν**: This is defined as `σ_μν = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. Since the gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless, `σ_μν` is also dimensionless, so `[σ_μν] = 0`.\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass dimension of the coupling constant **κ**:\n`[L_int] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ_μν] + [ψ] + [F^μν]`\n`4 = [κ] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2`\n`4 = [κ] + 3 + 2`\n`4 = [κ] + 5`\n`[κ] = 4 - 5 = -1`\n\nSo, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n### 2. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by a method called power counting, which looks at the mass dimensions of the coupling constants.\n\n*   If the mass dimension of a coupling constant is **positive** (`[g] > 0`), the interaction is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If the mass dimension of a coupling constant is **zero** (`[g] = 0`), the interaction is **renormalizable**.\n*   If the mass dimension of a coupling constant is **negative** (`[g] < 0`), the interaction is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn this case, `[κ] = -1`, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.\n\nThis kind of term with a negative mass dimension coupling is typical of an effective field theory, where it represents physics at a higher energy scale that has been \"integrated out\". Such operators are suppressed by this high energy scale, and while they can be used for calculations at low energies, they lead to uncontrollable divergences at higher orders of perturbation theory, requiring an infinite number of counterterms to cancel them.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
