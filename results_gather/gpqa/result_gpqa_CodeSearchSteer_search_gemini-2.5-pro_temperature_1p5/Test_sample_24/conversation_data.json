    "Here is an analysis of the two reactions to identify the reactants A and B.\n\n### Reaction 1: A + H₂SO₄ → 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one\n\nThis reaction involves a diol reacting with sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) to form a ketone, which is characteristic of a Pinacol rearrangement. The product is a spiro compound, which often results from the rearrangement of a fused ring system.\n\n*   **Reactant A must be a diol.** The options provided are either `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol` or `2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol`. The latter is an alcohol, and its reaction with sulfuric acid would typically cause dehydration, not a rearrangement to a ketone.\n*   **The starting material `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol` is a decalin-diol (a fused two-ring system).** Under acidic conditions, this type of 1,2-diol undergoes a pinacol rearrangement. The mechanism involves protonation of a hydroxyl group, loss of water to form a carbocation, followed by a 1,2-alkyl shift which causes one of the rings to contract and form the spirocyclic ketone product.\n\nTherefore, reactant A is `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol`. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n### Reaction 2: B + BuLi + H⁺ → 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol\n\nThis reaction uses butyllithium (BuLi), a strong base and nucleophile, followed by an acidic workup to produce a secondary alcohol. Let's analyze the possibilities for reactant B between the remaining options A and C.\n\n*   **Option C offers `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene` as reactant B.** This is an allylic ether. With a strong base like BuLi, this could undergo a-Wittig rearrangement. This pericyclic reaction converts an allylic ether into a homoallylic alcohol. However, a detailed analysis of the mechanism for this specific ether (benzyl prenyl ether) predicts the formation of a different constitutional isomer, `1-phenyl-2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-ol`, not the target product.\n*   **Option A offers `4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one` as reactant B.** This is the ketone corresponding to the product alcohol. The reaction `B + BuLi + H⁺` would represent the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol. While BuLi is primarily a nucleophile that would add a butyl group to the ketone, it can also act as a reducing agent in some cases by donating a hydride. However, standard reducing agents for this transformation are typically NaBH₄ or LiAlH₄. BuLi is more commonly used to add a butyl group via nucleophilic addition.\n\nGiven the discrepancy in the product of the-Wittig rearrangement from option C's reactant, we re-evaluate the possibilities. While the reduction of a ketone by BuLi is less common than nucleophilic addition, it is a known reaction. Conversely, the-Wittig rearrangement is generally very specific in its outcome, making it unlikely to produce the desired product from the proposed ether. Therefore, the reduction of the ketone is the more plausible, albeit less common, reaction in the context of this question.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Reactant A is `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol`.\n*   Reactant B is `4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one`.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
