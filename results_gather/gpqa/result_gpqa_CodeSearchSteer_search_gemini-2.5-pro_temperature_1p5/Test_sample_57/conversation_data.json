    "Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle infinities that arise in calculations, particularly from high-energy (ultraviolet) phenomena. These infinities suggest that the theory is incomplete or being applied beyond its valid range.\n\n*   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As the theory of the strong force, QCD is a quantum field theory. Like other quantum field theories, calculations in QCD involve integrals that diverge at high energies. Various regularization methods, such as lattice regularization, are essential to manage these infinities and extract meaningful physical predictions.\n\n*   **B) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is its potential to be a \"UV finite\" theory of quantum gravity. Unlike theories based on point particles, superstring theory posits that fundamental entities are one-dimensional strings. This extended nature smooths out interactions at very short distances (high energies), which is believed to eliminate the ultraviolet divergences that plague standard quantum field theories. For this reason, it is considered a theory that does not require regularization at high energies.\n\n*   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory faces its own problem with infinities, most famously the infinite self-energy of a point-like charged particle, such as an electron. Considering the energy stored in the electric field of a point charge leads to a divergent result as the radius of the charge approaches zero. While this is a classical problem and not an ultraviolet divergence from quantum loops, it is a divergence that requires some form of regularization or reinterpretation to resolve.\n\n*   **D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED, the quantum theory of electromagnetism, was one of the first theories where the problem of ultraviolet divergences was encountered and successfully managed. The calculations of physical quantities like the electron's mass and charge lead to infinite results, which must be handled through the combined process of regularization and renormalization to yield the incredibly precise predictions for which QED is famous.\n\nBased on this, Superstring Theory is the only option presented as a theory that is believed to be inherently free from high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences, thus not requiring regularization for them.\n\n<<<B>>>"
