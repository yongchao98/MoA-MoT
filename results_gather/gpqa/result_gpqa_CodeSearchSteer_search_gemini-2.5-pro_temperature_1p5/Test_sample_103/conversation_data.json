    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. As the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star moves towards and away from us, causing its spectral lines to shift to the blue and red, respectively. The amplitude of this periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars (K₁ and K₂) is equal to the ratio of their observed maximum wavelength shifts (Δλ₁ and Δλ₂):\n\n*   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n### 2. The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `m_p` is the mass of the planet.\n*   `M_star` is the mass of the star.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\nThis formula shows that the radial velocity amplitude `K` is proportional to the inverse cube root of the orbital period, `P^(-1/3)`.\n\n### 3. Setting up the Ratio\n\nWe can write the equation for each of the two systems:\n\n*   **System 1:** K₁ = C₁ * (1 / P₁)^(1/3)\n*   **System 2:** K₂ = C₂ * (1 / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nThe term `C` combines all the other factors: C = (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)) * (2πG)^(1/3).\n\nFrom the problem description, we know:\n*   The stars have the same mass (M₁ = M₂).\n*   The planets have similar masses (m_p1 ≈ m_p2).\n*   Since nothing is stated about the inclination, we assume it is similar for both systems for a meaningful comparison (sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)).\n\nGiven these equalities and similarities, the constant `C` is approximately the same for both systems (C₁ ≈ C₂).\n\n### 4. Calculating the Period Ratio\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the velocities:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = (C₂ * (1 / P₂)^(1/3)) / (C₁ * (1 / P₁)^(1/3))\n\nSince C₁ ≈ C₂, they cancel out:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = ((1 / P₂) / (1 / P₁))^(1/3)\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nWe already calculated that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. So we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo solve for the period ratio, we cube both sides of the equation:\n\n(1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. To get this, we take the reciprocal of our result:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. This value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
