    "The web search confirms the key formulas used in the derivation.\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The relationship is `v_r / c = Δλ / λ`. This is confirmed by multiple sources. Therefore, the ratio of radial velocity semi-amplitudes `K1 / K2` is indeed equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature `T_eq` is proportional to `1 / sqrt(a)`, where `a` is the semi-major axis. This confirms that the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2` is equal to `sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n\n3.  **Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K):** For a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_p << M_star`), the semi-amplitude `K` is given by formulas that simplify to `K` being proportional to `M_p / sqrt(a)`.\n    Source provides the relevant formulas for a circular orbit:\n    *   `v_star = (M_p / (M_star + M_p)) * v_K`\n    *   `v_K = sqrt(G * (M_star + M_p) / a)`\n    *   The observed radial velocity is `K = v_star * sin(i)`.\n    Combining and simplifying these (assuming `M_p << M_star` and `sin(i) ≈ 1`):\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n    `K ≈ (M_p * sqrt(G)) / (sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(a))`\n    This confirms the proportionality `K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a)`.\n\nThe derivation remains solid.\n\n*   **Goal:** Find `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n*   **From formula:** `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n*   **Derivation:**\n    *   From the radial velocity formula, `K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a)`.\n    *   Therefore, `K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n    *   From the Doppler shift formula, `K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n    *   Combining these: `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n*   **Solve for the temperature ratio:**\n    *   `sqrt(a2 / a1) = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)`.\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)`.\n*   **Plug in values:**\n    *   `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 0.75`.\n    *   `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`.\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 0.75 * (5 / 7) = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15 / 28`.\n*   **Calculate:**\n    *   `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`.\n\nThis result matches option C. The extraneous information (star's parameters, planets' radii) did not affect the final ratio. The logic is sound and confirmed by standard astronomical formulas.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nI will present the step-by-step derivation, starting from the formulas for equilibrium temperature and radial velocity, to arrive at the final numerical answer.\n\n1.  State the formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature and find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n2.  State the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude and find the ratio `K1 / K2`.\n3.  Relate the RV semi-amplitude to the Doppler shift.\n4.  Combine the equations to solve for the temperature ratio.\n5.  Substitute the given values and calculate the result.\n\nThis seems complete.\n\nTo provide a comprehensive answer to the user based on the prompt provided, I've performed the following analysis:\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal\nThe objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet1 and Planet2), denoted as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n### 2. Recall Key Formulas\nThe solution requires two main physical principles:\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a given star, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`).\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n*   **Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** A planet's gravitational pull causes its host star to \"wobble,\" inducing a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the planet's mass (M_p) and inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (`a`).\n    *   K ∝ M_p / √a\n\n### 3. Formulate the Ratios\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** Based on the T_eq formula, the ratio of the two planets' equilibrium temperatures is:\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / √a1) / (1 / √a2) = √ (a2 / a1)\n*   **Radial Velocity Ratio:** Based on the RV formula, the ratio of the star's wobble induced by each planet is:\n    *   K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / √a1) / (M_p2 / √a2) = (M_p1 / M_p2) * √ (a2 / a1)\n\n### 4. Connect the Formulas\nNotice that the term `√(a2 / a1)` is present in both ratio equations. This allows us to connect them. We can substitute the temperature ratio into the radial velocity ratio equation:\n*   K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (T_eq1 / T_eq2)\n\n### 5. Incorporate Given Data\nThe problem provides the Doppler shift (`Δλ`) for each planet, which is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`).\n*   K ∝ Δλ  => K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n\nNow, substitute this into the combined equation:\n*   Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (T_eq1 / T_eq2)\n\n### 6. Solve for the Unknown\nThe goal is to find T_eq1 / T_eq2. Rearranging the equation:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)\n\n### 7. Substitute Values and Calculate\nPlug in the given values:\n*   `Δλ_1` = 0.03 Å\n*   `Δλ_2` = 0.04 Å\n*   `M_p1` = 7 Earth masses\n*   `M_p2` = 5 Earth masses\n\nCalculation:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (0.03 / 0.04) * (5 / 7)\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (3 / 4) * (5 / 7)\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n### 8. Final Conclusion\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option C. The information regarding the star's properties (mass, radius, temperature) and the planets' radii was not needed for this specific ratio calculation as these terms cancel out.\n\nThe calculation is finalized and ready to be presented.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n\nFinal Check. No issues found. The reasoning is sound and calculations are straightforward. All necessary information was used, and unnecessary information was correctly identified as such.\n\n<<<C>>>\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 can be determined by using the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and the radial velocity method. Here is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nA planet's equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) depends on its star's temperature and radius, and the planet's distance from the star (semi-major axis, `a`). The relationship is given by `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 is:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1)`\n\nTo solve this, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n**2. Radial Velocity and Doppler Shift**\n\nThe problem provides the periodic Doppler shifts (`Δλ`) in a spectral line caused by each planet. This shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`).\n\n`K ∝ Δλ`\n\nSo, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n\n`K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 0.75`\n\n**3. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) it induces on its star is proportional to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis (`a`).\n\n`K ∝ M_p / √a`\n\nTherefore, the ratio `K1 / K2` can also be expressed as:\n\n`K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / √a1) / (M_p2 / √a2) = (M_p1 / M_p2) * √(a2 / a1)`\n\n**4. Combining the Equations**\n\nWe now have two expressions for `K1 / K2`. We can set them equal to each other and substitute the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1)`:\n\n`(M_p1 / M_p2) * (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\n**5. Solving for the Temperature Ratio**\n\nWe can now rearrange the formula to solve for the desired temperature ratio:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)`\n\n**6. Calculation**\n\nSubstitute the given values into the equation:\n*   `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.75`\n*   `M_p1 = 7` Earth masses\n*   `M_p2 = 5` Earth masses\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 0.75 * (5 / 7) = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15 / 28`\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
