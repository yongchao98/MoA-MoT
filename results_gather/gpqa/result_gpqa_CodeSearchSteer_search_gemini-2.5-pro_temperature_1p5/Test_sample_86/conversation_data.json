    "To identify the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound, let's break down the given information and analyze the possible structure.\n\n### **1. Structural Analysis**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 2 carbons.\n*   **Carbonyl group (C=O) present:** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl functional group.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond present:** A halogen atom (like Cl, Br, F) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\nCombining these facts, the most plausible structure is a halo-acetophenone. This consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This structure has the required C₆ ring, a C₂ substituent containing a carbonyl (acetyl group), for a total of 8 carbons.\n\nThe two substituents can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions. A para-substituted ring is highly symmetrical and gives a characteristic, simple ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **2. Predicting the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for a **para-halo-acetophenone** (e.g., 4-chloroacetophenone):\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This symmetry results in two signals, each representing 2 hydrogens. These signals appear as doublets due to splitting by their neighbors. They are located in the downfield region (typically 7.0-8.0 ppm) because of the deshielding effect of the aromatic ring and the electron-withdrawing acetyl group.\n*   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl group and not to any other protons. Therefore, it will appear as a singlet (a single peak with no splitting). This signal will integrate to 3 hydrogens and typically appears around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n\nSo, the predicted spectrum is: two doublets in the aromatic region (each for 2H) and one singlet in the aliphatic region (for 3H).\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    This option does not fit. The integration (number of hydrogens) and signal locations do not match an aromatic ketone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    This spectrum is a perfect match for a para-halo-acetophenone. It shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, which is characteristic of para-substitution. The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H is characteristic of an acetyl methyl group. The total hydrogen count (2+2+3=7) is correct for C₈H₇XO.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. This would correspond to a halo-phenylacetaldehyde. However, the methylene (-CH₂) and aldehyde (-CHO) protons should show coupling (doublet and triplet, respectively), not appear as two singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    This option lacks any signals in the aromatic proton region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), which immediately disqualifies it since the compound is defined as aromatic.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe data presented in option B is fully consistent with the structure of a para-halo-acetophenone, which satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<B>>>"
