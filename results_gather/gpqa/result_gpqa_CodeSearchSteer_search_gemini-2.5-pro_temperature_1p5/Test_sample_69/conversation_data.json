    "This chemical riddle describes a series of reactions that allow for the deduction of the identities of the substances involved. A careful, step-by-step analysis points to a specific set of compounds, ultimately revealing the nature of product E.\n\n1.  **Identifying C, F, and G:** The reaction `C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)` is a crucial clue. A reaction that produces two acids, one strong and one weak, is characteristic of the hydrolysis of certain non-metal halides. For example, phosphorus triiodide (PI₃) reacts vigorously with water to produce hydroiodic acid (HI, a strong acid) and phosphorous acid (H₃PO₃, a weak acid). This makes **PI₃ a strong candidate for C**. PI₃ is also described as a bright red solid, which matches the description of C perfectly.\n2.  **Identifying A and B:** If C is PI₃, then the reaction `A (solid) + 8 equivalents of gas B forms C` implies that solid A and gas B react to form PI₃. The most straightforward reactants to form PI₃ are its constituent elements: phosphorus (P) and iodine (I₂). Phosphorus is a solid, and while iodine is a solid under standard conditions, it readily sublimes into a gas. The problem states solid A and gas B, making it more likely that A is solid phosphorus and B is gaseous iodine, despite the stoichiometry mismatch. The formation reaction is `2 P(s) + 3 I₂(g) -> 2 PI₃(s)`. The \"8 equivalents\" appears to be a misleading detail, a common feature in such riddles.\n3.  **Identifying D and H:** The reaction `D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio must be considered. We have provisionally identified B as iodine gas, which does not fit this reaction well. Let's reconsider this step. An alternative, very common reaction between two gases to form a solvent is `CO(g) + Cl₂(g) -> COCl₂(g/l)`. Phosgene (COCl₂) is a known solvent. Let's explore the possibility that C is **iodine monochloride (ICl)**.\n    *   **C = ICl**: This is a red-brown solid, fitting the description.\n    *   **Hydrolysis of C**: `5 ICl + 3 H₂O -> 2 I₂ + 5 HCl + HIO₃`. This reaction reforms **A = I₂** (a solid), and produces **F = HCl** (a strong acid) and **G = HIO₃** (iodic acid, a weak acid). This is a perfect match for the description of Reaction 3.\n    *   **Formation of C**: `A + 8B -> C` becomes `I₂(s) + B(g) -> ICl`. For this to occur, B must be chlorine gas, **B = Cl₂**. The actual stoichiometry is `I₂ + Cl₂ -> 2ICl`. Again, the \"8 equivalents\" part seems to be a red herring.\n    *   **Formation of H**: `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent)` becomes `D(g) + Cl₂(g) -> H`. If **D = CO**, then **H = COCl₂** (phosgene), a known solvent, and the reaction is 1:1. This creates a consistent set of identities for all compounds.\n4.  **Identifying E and its Symmetry:** The final step is `C + 2 equivalents of gas D -> E (extremely hazardous product)`.\n    *   C = ICl\n    *   D = CO\n    *   E = ICl + 2CO → **ICl(CO)₂**\n    The product E is therefore Iodine Monochloride dicarbonyl. This is a known, though unstable, species. While not as infamously hazardous as some chemical warfare agents, many reactive, unstable compounds are considered extremely hazardous in a laboratory context.\n\nThe molecular structure of E, ICl(CO)₂, determines its symmetry group. Iodine is the central atom bonded to one chlorine atom and two carbonyl (CO) ligands. Based on VSEPR theory, the molecule is T-shaped. In its most symmetric arrangement, the molecule possesses a C₂ rotational axis and two perpendicular planes of symmetry. This combination of symmetry elements corresponds to the **C₂ᵥ point group**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
