    "To solve this problem, we need to compare the luminosities of the two stars. The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law.\n\n**1. Stefan-Boltzmann Law:**\nThe luminosity (L) of a star is related to its radius (R) and its surface temperature (T) by the following equation:\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\nwhere σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n**2. Luminosity Ratio:**\nTo find the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) is greater than that of Star_2 (L₂), we can set up a ratio:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂) * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**3. Radius Ratio:**\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2:\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂  =>  R₁/R₂ = 1.5\nTherefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n**4. Temperature Ratio:**\nTo find the temperature ratio, we use the information about the peak emission wavelengths. According to Wien's Displacement Law, the peak wavelength (λ_max) of a black body's emitted radiation is inversely proportional to its temperature (T).\n\nThe problem states that the \"wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest\" are the same. This implies that the observed peak wavelengths are identical. The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity due to the Doppler effect.\n\n*   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity is 0 km/s, so there is no Doppler shift. The observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,1) is equal to its intrinsic peak wavelength (λ_rest,1).\n*   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity is 700 km/s. This motion causes a redshift, meaning the light waves are stretched to longer wavelengths. The observed wavelength (λ_obs,2) is related to the intrinsic wavelength (λ_rest,2) by the formula for non-relativistic speeds:\n    λ_obs,2 ≈ λ_rest,2 * (1 + v/c)\n    where v = 700 km/s and c is the speed of light (~300,000 km/s).\n\nSince the observed wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2):\nλ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v/c)\n\nFrom Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T, where b is a constant), we can substitute temperature into the equation:\nb/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v/c)\n1/T₁ = (1/T₂) * (1 + v/c)\nThis gives us the temperature ratio:\nT₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v/c)\n\n**5. Final Calculation:**\nNow we substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v/c)]⁴\n\nLet's plug in the values:\nv/c = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s ≈ 0.002333\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009366\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>"
