    "To identify the unknown organic compound, the provided 1H NMR data must be analyzed and compared to the structures of the possible options.\n\n### Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet integrating to three protons in this region is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (CH₃-COO-). All four possible compounds contain an acetate group, so this signal is consistent with all options.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet integrating to three protons suggests a methyl group (CH₃) coupled to a single adjacent proton. This indicates a -CH-CH₃ fragment. This structural feature is present in the propenyl acetate isomers but not the butenyl acetate isomers. Therefore, we can eliminate Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is a doublet, meaning it's coupled to one other proton. It appears in the alkene (vinylic) region of the spectrum. The crucial piece of information is the coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants for protons in a *trans* configuration on a double bond are typically in the range of 12-18 Hz, while *cis* protons have smaller coupling constants, usually between 6-12 Hz. The large value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a *trans* relationship between the two vinylic protons.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal represents the other vinylic proton. The splitting pattern, a doublet of quartets (dq), means it is coupled to two different sets of protons. The doublet (d) arises from coupling to the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm), and the quartet (q) arises from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm).\n\n### Assembling the Structure:\n\n1.  The data points to a propenyl acetate structure (CH₃-CH=CH-O-CO-CH₃), eliminating the butenyl options.\n2.  The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinylic protons is definitive for a *trans* configuration.\n3.  The structure is therefore Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nThe assignments for Trans-propenyl acetate are as follows:\n*   **Acetate methyl (CH₃-CO-):** 2.1 ppm (s, 3H)\n*   **Vinylic proton (-O-CH=):** 7.0 ppm (d, 1H) - Deshielded by the adjacent oxygen.\n*   **Vinylic proton (=CH-CH₃):** 5.5 ppm (dq, 1H) - Coupled to both the other vinylic H and the methyl group.\n*   **Methyl on double bond (=CH-CH₃):** 1.6 ppm (d, 3H) - Coupled to the adjacent vinylic proton.\n\nThis complete assignment is consistent with all the provided data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
