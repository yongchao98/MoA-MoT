    "Based on a review of the provided statements and current scientific literature, the incorrect statement is D.\n\n*   **Statement A is correct.** Studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein can induce apoptosis by activating caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. This activation occurs without a significant change in the levels of Bcl-2, a primary regulator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. While the extrinsic pathway can subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway via Bid cleavage, the initial mechanism described is accurate.\n*   **Statement B is correct.** Research has indicated that there is a correlation between the number of conformations a frameshifting pseudoknot can adopt and the rate of frameshifting. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 possess complex frameshifting elements that can adopt multiple conformations, influencing the efficiency of producing the viral polymerase.\n*   **Statement C is correct.** Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) is an essential mechanism for SARS-CoV-2. It occurs at the 5' end of the genome between ORF1a and ORF1b. A slippery sequence (UUUAAAC) and a downstream RNA pseudoknot cause the ribosome to slip back one nucleotide, allowing it to continue translation in a new reading frame to produce the pp1ab polyprotein. The frameshifting elements of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are structurally and functionally very similar.\n*   **Statement D is incorrect.** The nsp10/nsp14 complex does form a heterodimer with 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity, which functions as a proofreading or mismatch repair mechanism. Nsp10 binding significantly stimulates the nsp14 ExoN activity. However, the function of this complex is to *hydrolyze* or *break down* dsRNA, particularly at the 3' end where a mismatch has occurred. It does not prevent the breakdown of dsRNA; rather, it performs a controlled breakdown to ensure replication fidelity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
