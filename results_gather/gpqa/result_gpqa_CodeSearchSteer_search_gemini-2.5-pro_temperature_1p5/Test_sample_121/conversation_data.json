    "The identity of the final product and the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum are determined through the following step-by-step synthesis:\n\n*   **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    Acetic acid undergoes α-bromination when treated with bromine (Br2) in the presence of a catalyst like pyridine. This reaction, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, substitutes a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid group is converted into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n*   **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in a substitution reaction (SN2), a common method to prepare cyanoacetates.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n*   **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a classic cyclization reaction analogous to the malonic ester synthesis.\n    1.  The sodium hydride, a strong base, removes a proton from the α-carbon (the CH₂ group between the nitrile and the ester), which is acidic due to the two electron-withdrawing groups.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n    3.  Because excess NaH is used, the second proton on the α-carbon is removed, creating a new carbanion.\n    4.  This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular attack on the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)cyclohexane\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the final product, 1-cyano-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)cyclohexane.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 has a plane of symmetry that passes through the quaternary carbon (C1, bonded to -CN and -COOEt), the C4 carbon, and the substituents on C1. This symmetry affects the chemical equivalence of the ring protons.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one signal**.\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are chemically equivalent. This will produce a **second signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:** Due to the substituents on C1, none of the ring protons are equivalent in a simple sense, but symmetry helps.\n    *   **C2 and C6 positions:** These positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, these four protons (two on C2, two on C6) will give rise to **two distinct signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5 positions:** Similarly, these positions are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four protons will give another **two distinct signals**.\n    *   **C4 position:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and will produce **two distinct signals**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCounting the distinct signals:\n*   Ethyl group: 2 signals\n*   Cyclohexane ring (C2/C6, C3/C5, C4): 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals\n\nThe total number of observable hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of product 4 is 2 + 6 = 8.\n\n<<<A>>>"
