    "The expectation value of an operator is a key concept in quantum mechanics, representing the average result of a measurement of that observable. To solve this problem, we will calculate the expectation value of the given operator for the specified spin state.\n\n### State and Operator Definitions\n\nThe spin-half particle is in the state:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nHere, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the spin-up and spin-down states, which are the eigenstates of the Pauli matrix σz. The operator for which we need to find the expectation value is:\nO = 10σz + 5σx\n\nThe Pauli matrices are defined as:\n*   **σz** = [, [0, -1]]\n*   **σx** = [,]\n\n### Calculation of the Expectation Value\n\nThe expectation value of the operator O, denoted as ⟨O⟩, is given by ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. Due to the linearity of operators, this can be broken down as:\n⟨O⟩ = ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩\n\nWe will now calculate the expectation values for σz and σx separately.\n\n1.  **Expectation value of σz:**\n    The probability of measuring spin-up is P(↑) = |0.5|² = 0.25.\n    The probability of measuring spin-down is P(↓) = |(√3)/2|² = 0.75.\n\n    The expectation value of σz is the sum of its eigenvalues weighted by their probabilities:\n    ⟨σz⟩ = (+1) * P(↑) + (-1) * P(↓)\n    ⟨σz⟩ = 1 * (0.25) - 1 * (0.75) = -0.5\n\n2.  **Expectation value of σx:**\n    The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is calculated as ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.\n    First, we apply σx to the state |ψ⟩:\n    σx|ψ⟩ = σx(0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩)\n    Using the properties σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩, we get:\n    σx|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↓⟩ + (√3)/2|↑⟩\n\n    Next, we take the inner product with ⟨ψ|:\n    ⟨σx⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * ((√3)/2|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩)\n    Due to the orthonormality of the basis states (⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0, ⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1, ⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1):\n    ⟨σx⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2) * ⟨↑|↑⟩ + (√3/2 * 0.5) * ⟨↓|↓⟩\n    ⟨σx⟩ = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the individual expectation values back into the main equation:\n⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)\n⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is **-0.7**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
