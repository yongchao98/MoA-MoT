  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Single-Gene Mutants\n*   **Wild-Type (Control):** 100% resistance.\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function causes a 25% reduction in resistance. This indicates G1 plays a role in the plant's defense.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function completely eliminates resistance. This suggests G2 is an essential gene for this trait. Genes that are absolutely required for a pathway to function are often upstream regulators, like transcription factors.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function results in a 50% reduction in resistance, indicating it plays a more significant role than G1.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Double-Gene Mutants (Gene Interactions)\nTo understand how the genes interact, we look at the phenotypes of the double mutants.\n\n*   **Epistasis:** This is a genetic interaction where one gene masks the effect of another. If a double mutant (e.g., `g1g2`) shows the same phenotype as one of the single mutants (e.g., `g2`), then the gene of the single mutant (`G2`) is considered \"epistatic\" to the other gene (`G1`). This typically implies the epistatic gene acts upstream in the same pathway.\n    *   **g1g2 mutant (0% resistance):** This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant's phenotype (0% resistance). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n    *   **g2g3 mutant (0% resistance):** This phenotype is also identical to the `g2` single mutant's phenotype (0% resistance). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n    *   **Conclusion from epistasis:** Since G2's knockout phenotype masks the phenotypes of both G1 and G3 knockouts, it strongly suggests G2 acts upstream of both G1 and G3. The prompt mentions that one gene is a transcription factor, and G2's role as an essential, upstream regulator makes it the prime candidate.\n\n*   **Interaction between G1 and G3:**\n    *   **g1g3 mutant (10% resistance):** The phenotype of this double mutant is more severe than either of the single mutants (`g1`=75%, `g3`=50%). When the combined effect of two mutations is greater than the sum of their individual effects, it's called a synergistic interaction. This often happens when the two genes function in parallel pathways or have partially redundant functions. The loss of both creates a more significant defect than the loss of just one. Among the given choices, \"gene redundancy\" is the term that best describes this type of relationship, where two genes perform similar or related functions.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\nBased on the analysis above, we have two key conclusions:\n1.  G2 is an upstream regulator, epistatic to G1 and G3, and is the most likely candidate for the transcription factor.\n2.  G1 and G3 have a synergistic or partially redundant relationship.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options with these conclusions:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* This aligns with our findings.\n    *   *G1 and G3 has the same promoter:* This is plausible if G2 regulates both, but it cannot be concluded from the data.\n    *   *G3 is epistatic towards G1:* This is incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) does not match the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* This aligns with our findings.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show pleiotropy:* This is incorrect terminology. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, not when multiple genes affect one trait.\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* This is incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) does not match the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* This aligns with our findings.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:* This is the best available description for the synergistic interaction observed.\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* This part is incorrect based on the data. However, the first two parts of this statement are the most accurate descriptions of the gene functions and interactions.\n\n*   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   *G1 is a transcription factor:* This contradicts our finding that G2 is the essential upstream regulator.\n    *   *G2 and G3 show pleiotropy:* Incorrect terminology.\n    *   *G2 is epistatic towards G1:* This statement is correct, but the primary assertion of the option (G1 is the TF) is wrong.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption C provides the most accurate description of the experimental results, even with an inaccuracy in its third clause. It correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor based on its epistatic relationship with G1 and G3. It also correctly characterizes the relationship between G1 and G3 as a form of redundancy, which leads to the observed synergistic effect. The other options contain more significant errors, either by misidentifying the transcription factor or by using incorrect genetic terms. Therefore, C is the best possible conclusion among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
