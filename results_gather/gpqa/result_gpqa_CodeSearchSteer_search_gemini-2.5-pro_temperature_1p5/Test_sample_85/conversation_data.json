    "Based on the principles of organic chemistry and the confirmed selectivity of the reducing agents, the following analysis determines the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe goal is to produce two different stereoisomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone. Lactones are formed from the intramolecular cyclization of hydroxy acids. In this case, the precursor to the product is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which cyclizes to form the δ-lactone. The reactions start with a dicarboxylic acid monoester, specifically a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid. The key to solving this problem lies in the different selectivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n1.  **Reaction A with LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group first reacts as an acid, getting deprotonated by the hydride to form a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Compound A, which is (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid), has both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid will remain untouched (after being deprotonated and then reprotonated during the acidic workup).\n    *   **Intermediate:** The reduction of the ester group in Compound A yields 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediate and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (cyclization) of the 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid to form the δ-lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The chemical transformations do not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material, which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n2.  **Reaction B with BH₃ (Borane):**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known for its ability to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Compound B, with the same functional groups, is treated with BH₃. The BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact. This initially forms a hydroxy ester. During the acidic workup (H⁺), the ester is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Intermediate:** The reduction of the carboxylic acid group followed by hydrolysis of the ester in Compound B yields 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   **Lactonization:** As in the first reaction, this hydroxy acid then cyclizes under the acidic conditions to form the δ-lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reaction sequence does not affect the chiral center. The configuration of the starting material is retained in the final product. To produce (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Summary**\n\n*   **Reaction A:** (R)-starting material + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone\n*   **Reaction B:** (S)-starting material + BH₃ → (S)-lactone\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
