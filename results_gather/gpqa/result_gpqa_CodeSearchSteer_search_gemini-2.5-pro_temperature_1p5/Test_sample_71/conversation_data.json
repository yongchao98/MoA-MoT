    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product 4 and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the reactive diene and Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n\nThe reaction between 1,2-bis(dihalomethyl)arenes and sodium iodide is a known method for generating highly reactive o-quinodimethane intermediates. In this case, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene reacts with NaI to form the reactive diene, 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. This species is an isomer of o-xylene and is a powerful diene for cycloaddition reactions.\n\nThis generated diene then reacts with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which serves as a dienophile. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, two successive Diels-Alder reactions occur, one on each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene system. This forms a complex polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄)\n\nThis step involves the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the *tert*-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OC(CH₃)₃) at the C7 bridge position of the norbornane core is cleaved to form a secondary alcohol (-OH). This reaction yields **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2\n*   **Reagent:** SO₃•pyridine in DMSO\n\nThese are the conditions for a Parikh-Doering oxidation. This mild oxidation converts the secondary alcohol at the C7 position into a ketone (C=O). The resulting polycyclic ketone is **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3\n*   **Condition:** Heating to 150°C\n\nHeating a Diels-Alder adduct often leads to a reverse reaction, known as a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. Product 3 is a derivative of a bis-Diels-Alder adduct. The thermal conditions will cause the fragmentation of the molecule. The reaction is essentially the reverse of the initial cycloadditions.\n\nThe fragmentation of Product 3 yields two molecules of the original diene (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene) and one molecule of the original dienophile's core, which is 7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (commonly known as 7-norbornadienone).\n\nHowever, 7-norbornadienone is known to be highly unstable. It rapidly undergoes a cheletropic elimination, losing a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, benzene (C₆H₆). This decomposition is extremely fast at room temperature and would be instantaneous at 150°C.\n\nThus, the final stable products of the heating step are benzene, carbon monoxide, and two molecules of 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. The question asks for the number of distinct hydrogens on **Product 4**. It is logical to assume that \"Product 4\" refers to the most complex organic molecule generated, which is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n\n**Analysis of the Structure of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze its symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered carbon ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3 (C1=C2 and C3=C4). At positions 5 and 6, there are exocyclic double bonds (=CH₂).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n*   **Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  The hydrogen atom on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4 due to the C₂ symmetry. This gives one set of equivalent protons.\n    2.  The hydrogen atom on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. This gives a second set of protons.\n    3.  The two exocyclic methylene (=CH₂) groups at C5 and C6 are equivalent. Within each methylene group, the two protons are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic). One proton is *cis* to the adjacent ring carbon, and one is *trans*. The C₂ axis makes the two *cis* protons (one on each methylene group) equivalent to each other.\n    4.  Similarly, the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other.\n\nTherefore, the 8 hydrogen atoms in the molecule are divided into four chemically distinct sets.\n\n1.  H on C1 and C4 (2H)\n2.  H on C2 and C3 (2H)\n3.  The two \"cis\" hydrogens on the exocyclic methylenes (2H)\n4.  The two \"trans\" hydrogens on the exocyclic methylenes (2H)\n\nThis results in a total of **4** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>"
