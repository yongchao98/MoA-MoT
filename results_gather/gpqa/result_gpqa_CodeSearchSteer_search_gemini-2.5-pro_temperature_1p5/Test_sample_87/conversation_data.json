    "The process taking place is somatic hypermutation. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental evidence:\n\n*   **Oral Antigen Delivery and Peyer's Patches:** The rotavirus proteins were delivered orally, and an immune response was observed in the Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a critical part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) responsible for initiating immune responses to antigens from the intestinal lumen.\n\n*   **Proliferating Cells:** The isolation of a \"proliferating cell population\" from these Peyer's patches indicates that B cells have been activated by the antigen and are undergoing clonal expansion. This proliferation occurs in specialized microenvironments called germinal centers.\n\n*   **High Variability in the Variable Heavy Chain Gene:** The key observation is the \"high variability\" found specifically in the variable heavy chain gene of these proliferating B cells. This points directly to somatic hypermutation (SHM). SHM is a process that occurs in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) after B cells are activated by an antigen. It introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes. This process diversifies the B cell receptors, allowing for the selection of cells that produce antibodies with a higher affinity for the antigen. Studies have confirmed that Peyer's patches are active sites of somatic hypermutation.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Incorrect:\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is part of the innate immune system and does not involve the genetic mutation of B cell antibody genes.\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This process creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors but occurs in the bone marrow during the early development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening in mature B cells that are already responding to an antigen in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n*   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers, often concurrently with SHM. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, which determines the antibody's isotype (e.g., IgM to IgG or IgA). It does not alter the *variable* region or affect antigen specificity. The scenario specifically mentions variability in the \"variable heavy chain gene,\" which is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
