    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻). Here is the detailed breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### 1. Calculate the Molar Amounts\nFirst, we determine the number of moles for each compound dissolved in the solution.\n\n*   **For KH₂PO₄:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol of H₂PO₄⁻\n\n*   **For Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol of HPO₄²⁻\n\n### 2. Calculate the Initial Concentrations\nNext, we find the initial molar concentrations of the ions in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution.\n\n*   **Concentration of [H₂PO₄⁻]:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Concentration of [HPO₄²⁻]:**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n### 3. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]\nThe solution is a buffer composed of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka₂.\n\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n\nWe can use the expression for Ka₂ to find the concentration of H⁺ ions.\n\nKa₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * 1.308\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n### 4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, which is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka₃.\n\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n\nThe expression for Ka₃ is:\n\nKa₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹² = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can now solve for [PO₄³⁻], using the previously calculated [H⁺] and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻]. The concentration of H⁺ is determined by the stronger buffer system (H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻) and can be treated as constant for this calculation.\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = (Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻]) / [H⁺]\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹² * 0.02809 M) / (8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
