    "The minimum energy of the described system is determined by the electrostatic potential energy. This total energy is the sum of two components: the interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 outer charges, and the interaction energy among the 12 outer charges themselves.\n\nThe system consists of:\n*   13 identical particles with charge `q = 2e`.\n*   The elementary charge `e` is `1.602176634 × 10^-19` C.\n*   One particle is fixed at a point P.\n*   12 particles are constrained to a distance `r = 2 m` from P.\n*   Coulomb's constant `k` is approximately `8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²`.\n\nTo achieve the minimum energy state, the 12 particles on the sphere of radius `r` will arrange themselves to maximize their separation. For 12 particles, this configuration corresponds to the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe total potential energy `U_total` is calculated as follows:\n\n1.  **Energy of interaction with the central charge (`U_center`)**: Each of the 12 outer charges is at a distance `r` from the central charge. The potential energy for each is `k * q² / r`. For all 12, this is:\n    `U_center = 12 * (k * q² / r)`\n\n2.  **Energy of interactions among the 12 outer charges (`U_sphere`)**: This is the sum of the potential energies for all pairs of charges on the sphere. There are `12 * 11 / 2 = 66` such pairs. This is the classic Thomson problem. The energy can be expressed as:\n    `U_sphere = C_12 * (k * q² / r)`\n    where `C_12` is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of reciprocal distances for a unit-radius icosahedron.\n\nThe total energy is the sum of these two components:\n`U_total = U_center + U_sphere = (12 + C_12) * (k * q² / r)`\n\nThe constant `C_12` for an icosahedron is derived from its geometry. The vertices of a unit-radius icosahedron have 5 nearest neighbors at a distance `d₁ ≈ 1.0515`, 5 next-nearest neighbors at a distance `d₂ ≈ 1.7013`, and 1 opposite vertex at a distance `d₃ = 2`. The sum of reciprocal distances for all 66 pairs is calculated as:\n`C_12 = (12/2) * (5/d₁ + 5/d₂ + 1/d₃) = 6 * (5/1.0515 + 5/1.7013 + 1/2) ≈ 49.165`\n\nNow, we can calculate the final energy:\n*   `q = 2 * 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C = 3.204353268 × 10^-19 C`.\n*   `k = 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²`.\n*   `r = 2 m`.\n\nThe energy unit `(k * q² / r)` is:\n` (8.98755 × 10^9 * (3.20435 × 10^-19)²) / 2 ≈ 4.6143 × 10^-28 J`\n\nThe total minimum energy is:\n`U_total = (12 + 49.165) * 4.6143 × 10^-28 J`\n`U_total = 61.165 * 4.6143 × 10^-28 J ≈ 2.822 × 10^-26 J`\n\nThis result matches one of the provided options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
