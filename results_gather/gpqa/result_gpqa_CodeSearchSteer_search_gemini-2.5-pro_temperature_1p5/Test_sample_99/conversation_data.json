    "Here is a breakdown of the reaction sequence and an evaluation of each statement:\n\n*   **Compound A (C3H6):** This is propene (CH3-CH=CH2).\n*   **A → B:** Propene undergoes bromination with Br2 in CCl4. This addition reaction breaks the double bond and adds a bromine atom to each carbon, forming 1,2-dibromopropane.\n*   **B → C:** 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH) in a double dehydrohalogenation reaction (removal of 2 HBr molecules) to form propyne (CH3-C≡CH), an alkyne.\n*   **C → D:** Propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This causes a cyclotrimerization reaction, where three propyne molecules join to form an aromatic ring, producing 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (also known as mesitylene).\n*   **D → E:** 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (D) reacts with a nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4) in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. A nitro group (NO2) is added to the benzene ring, forming 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (E).\n*   **E → F:** The nitro group in compound E is reduced to an amino group (NH2) using iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This forms 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (also known as mesidine) (F).\n*   **F → G:** The primary aromatic amine (F) reacts with nitrous acid (NaNO2/HCl) at low temperatures in a diazotization reaction to form a diazonium salt, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride (G).\n*   **G → H:** The diazonium salt (G) is warmed with a basic solution (NaOH), which causes hydrolysis. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (H).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n**A) C is a flammable gas.**\nCompound C is propyne. Propyne has a boiling point of -23.2°C, meaning it is a gas at room temperature. It is also documented as a colorless, highly flammable gas. Thus, this statement is correct.\n\n**B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\nCompound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, typically producing an intense violet, blue, green, or red-brown color due to the formation of a colored complex with the iron ion. The original ferric chloride solution is yellow. A resulting yellow color indicates the absence of a reaction, not a positive test for a phenol. Therefore, the claim that H gives a yellow color is incorrect as this signifies a negative test, whereas phenols are expected to give a distinct color change.\n\n**C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\nCompound F is mesidine (2,4,6-trimethylaniline). Aromatic amines, including aniline derivatives like mesidine, are widely used as intermediates in the synthesis of dyes. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\n**D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\nCompound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to the high symmetry of the molecule, all three methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and their nine protons produce a single signal (a singlet). Likewise, the three aromatic protons on the benzene ring are also equivalent to each other, producing a second single signal (a singlet). Therefore, its 1H NMR spectrum consists of two singlets. This statement is correct.\n\nThe incorrect statement is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
