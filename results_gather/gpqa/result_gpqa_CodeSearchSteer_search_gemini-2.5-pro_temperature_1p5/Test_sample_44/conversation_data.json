    "Here is a step-by-step calculation for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the energy levels are given by:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\nwhere 'n' is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n*   E₁ = 1²E = E\n*   E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n*   and so on.\n\n**2. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 fermions, which means they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by the energy level 'n' and the spin (up or down). Consequently, each energy level 'n' can hold at most two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles to achieve the minimum total energy.\n*   Two particles go into the n=1 level (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₁ = 2E.\n*   The remaining two particles go into the n=2 level (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy**\n\nTo find the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3). This represents the smallest possible increase in total energy.\n*   The n=1 level remains filled with two particles (Energy: 2 × E₁ = 2E).\n*   One particle remains in the n=2 level (Energy: 1 × E₂ = 4E).\n*   One particle is excited to the n=3 level (Energy: 1 × E₃ = 9E).\n\nThe total first excited state energy is the sum:\nE_first = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nTo find the second excited state, we must consider all possible excitations from the ground state that would result in a higher energy than the first excited state. The one with the lowest energy among these will be the second excited state.\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy: (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Energy: (2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy: (1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nComparing the energies (22E, 20E, 18E), the lowest energy for the next excitation level is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energies are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
