    "To solve this problem, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound and then determine which 1:1 mixture matches the provided spectral data.\n\n### Analysis of Individual Compounds\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Due to its high symmetry, there is only one type of aromatic proton and one type of methyl proton.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons on the ring are equivalent, leading to a single signal (a 2H singlet).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent, resulting in a single signal (a 12H singlet).\n    *   **Summary:** One 2H aromatic singlet, one 12H aliphatic singlet.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two distinct aromatic protons which are not coupled to each other. This results in two separate 1H singlets.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This leads to three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** Two 1H aromatic singlets, three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two aromatic protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent, forming an AA' system that appears as a single 2H signal, which is typically observed as a singlet in low-resolution spectra.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C4 (6H) and the pair at C2 and C3 (6H). This gives two aliphatic singlets with a 6H:6H integration ratio, which simplifies to 1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** One 2H aromatic singlet, two 1H aliphatic singlets (1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent due to symmetry and produce a single 4H singlet.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The spectrum shows characteristic signals for an ethyl group: a quartet for the -CH2- protons and a triplet for the -CH3- protons. This does not match the problem's description of only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n    *   **Summary:** One 4H aromatic singlet, one 4H aliphatic quartet, and one 6H aliphatic triplet. This compound can be eliminated.\n\n### Analysis of the 1:1 Mixture\n\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the remaining options:\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** The aromatic region would contain a 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio, which contradicts the observed data.\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** The aromatic region would contain a 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would also result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio, which is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB):**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this combination would produce two singlets, each integrating to 2H. The ratio of these two signals would be 1:1, perfectly matching the description.\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum would exhibit three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these signals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also perfectly matches the description.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,3,5-TMB + 1,4-diethylbenzene):** This option is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\nBased on this analysis, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
