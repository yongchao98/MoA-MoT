    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must evaluate each star based on two main criteria: its visibility from the Paranal Observatory and whether its brightness allows for a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a one-hour exposure.\n\n### 1. ESPRESSO Instrument Capability\n\nThe ESPRESSO spectrograph is coupled to one of the 8.2-meter Unit Telescopes (UT) of the Very Large Telescope (VLT). For this setup (the \"1-UT\" mode), official ESO documentation states that ESPRESSO can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 in a one-hour exposure for stars as faint as V-band magnitude ~16 or ~17, depending on the specific high-resolution mode used. A performance plot in the user manual confirms that for a 3600-second (1-hour) exposure, an S/N of 10 is reached for stars with a V magnitude of approximately 16-17. We will conservatively use a limiting magnitude of V=16 for this analysis.\n\n### 2. Visibility from Paranal Observatory\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees (24.6° S). This southern location restricts the portion of the northern sky that can be observed. An object's declination (celestial latitude) determines its visibility.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Each Star\n\n**a) Canopus:**\n*   **Magnitude:** Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent visual magnitude of approximately -0.74.\n*   **Visibility:** It has a declination of about -52°. This southern declination makes it easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** Its magnitude of -0.74 is significantly brighter than the V=16 limit. **Therefore, Canopus is detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris:**\n*   **Magnitude:** Polaris has an apparent visual magnitude of about 2.0.\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination is approximately +89°. From Paranal's southern latitude, Polaris is never visible as it never rises above the horizon.\n*   **Detectability:** Since it cannot be observed, **Polaris is not detectable.**\n\n**c) Star with M=15 at 10 pc:**\n*   **Magnitude:** The apparent magnitude (m) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) in parsecs using the formula m = M - 5 + 5log₁₀(d).\n    m = 15 - 5 + 5log₁₀(10) = 10 + 5(1) = 15.\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination of 0° (on the celestial equator) makes it readily visible from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** At V=15, this star is brighter than the limiting magnitude of V=16. **Therefore, this star is detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with M=15 at 200 pc:**\n*   **Magnitude:** m = 15 - 5 + 5log₁₀(200) ≈ 10 + 5(2.30) = 10 + 11.5 = 21.5.\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination of 0° is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** With a magnitude of V=21.5, it is much fainter than the V=16 limit. **Therefore, this star is not detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with M=15 at 5 pc:**\n*   **Magnitude:** m = 15 - 5 + 5log₁₀(5) ≈ 10 + 5(0.70) = 10 + 3.5 = 13.5.\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination of 0° is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** At V=13.5, it is brighter than the V=16 limit. **Therefore, this star is detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with M=15 at 50 pc:**\n*   **Magnitude:** m = 15 - 5 + 5log₁₀(50) ≈ 10 + 5(1.70) = 10 + 8.5 = 18.5.\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination of 0° is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** With a magnitude of V=18.5, it is fainter than the V=16 limit. **Therefore, this star is not detectable.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTallying the results, we find three detectable stars:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  The star at 10 pc (V=15)\n3.  The star at 5 pc (V=13.5)\n\nThus, a total of 3 stars from the list would be detectable.\n\n<<<B>>>"
