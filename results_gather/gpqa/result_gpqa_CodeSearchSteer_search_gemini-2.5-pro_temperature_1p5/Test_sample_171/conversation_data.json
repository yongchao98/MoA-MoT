    "The relationship between the populations of atomic energy levels and temperature in a stellar photosphere is described by the Boltzmann equation, assuming the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is given by:\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_j / N_i` is the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state `j` to the number of atoms in a lower energy state `i`. This ratio represents the \"excitation\" of the atoms.\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the two energy levels.\n*   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the effective temperature of the stellar photosphere.\n\nLet's denote the excitation ratio for star 1 (temperature T_1) as `R_1` and for star 2 (temperature T_2) as `R_2`.\n\nFor star 1:\n`R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]`\n\nFor star 2:\n`R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\nThe problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice the excitation in star 2, so `R_1 = 2 * R_2`.\n\n`(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\nThe statistical weight term `(g_j / g_i)` cancels out:\n`exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n`ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\nRearranging the terms to solve for `ln(2)`:\n`ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\nCombining the terms in the parenthesis gives:\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference `ΔE` as approximately `1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant, `k`, has a defined value of exactly `1.380649 × 10^(-23) J/K`. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting `ΔE / k ≈ 1`, the equation simplifies to:\n`ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
