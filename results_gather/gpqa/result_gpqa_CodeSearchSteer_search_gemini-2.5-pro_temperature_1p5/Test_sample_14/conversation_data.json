    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which planet has a higher transit probability:\n\n1.  **Understand Transit Probability:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's semi-major axis, especially for circular orbits. The formula is:\n    *   p_transit ≈ R_star / a\n    where *R_star* is the stellar radius and *a* is the semi-major axis.\n\n2.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Knowns:** To compare the probabilities, the semi-major axis (*a*) must be expressed in terms of the given information: the planet's orbital period (*P*) and the host star's mass (*M_star*). Kepler's Third Law provides this relationship. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (P² ∝ a³). When considering the star's mass, the more complete formula is:\n    *   P² = (4π² / (G * M_star)) * a³\n    (assuming the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's).\n\n3.  **Solve for Semi-Major Axis (a):** Rearranging Kepler's Third Law to solve for *a* gives:\n    *   a³ ∝ M_star * P²\n    *   a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Set up the Probability Ratio:** The ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (p_t1) to that of Planet_2 (p_t2) is:\n    *   p_t1 / p_t2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)\n    *   p_t1 / p_t2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a2 / a1)\n\n5.  **Substitute the Known Relationships:**\n    *   We are given that the stars have the same radii: **R_s1 = R_s2**, so the ratio R_s1 / R_s2 = 1.\n    *   The mass of Star_1 is twice that of Star_2: **M_s1 = 2 * M_s2**.\n    *   The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: **P1 = P2 / 3**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\n    *   a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * P2²) / (M_s1 * P1²) ]^(1/3)\n    *   Substitute the values: a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * (3 * P1)²) / ((2 * M_s2) * P1²) ]^(1/3)\n    *   Simplify the expression: a2 / a1 = [ (9 * M_s2 * P1²) / (2 * M_s2 * P1²) ]^(1/3)\n    *   The M_s2 and P1² terms cancel out: a2 / a1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   p_t1 / p_t2 = 1 * (4.5)^(1/3)\n    *   The cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65.\n    *   Therefore, p_t1 / p_t2 ≈ 1.65.\n\nThis calculation shows that the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. The shorter orbital period of Planet_1, which places it closer to its star, has a greater effect on increasing its transit probability than its more massive host star has on decreasing it.\n\nThe researchers would choose to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
