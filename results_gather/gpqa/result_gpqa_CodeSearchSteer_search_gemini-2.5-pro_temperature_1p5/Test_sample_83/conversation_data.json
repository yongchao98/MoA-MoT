    "When solving higher-dimensional heat equations using numerical methods that involve parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function that arises from the semi-discretization of the partial differential equation is often approximated by a rational function (a fractional approximation). The conversion of the sequential algorithm into a parallel one hinges on the mathematical properties of this approximation.\n\nThe key factor that enables this parallelization is the ability to decompose the fractional approximation into a sum of simpler fractions, a technique known as partial fraction expansion. By expressing the rational function as a sum of terms with linear denominators, the matrix problem can be broken down into several smaller, independent systems of linear equations. Each of these systems can then be solved concurrently on a separate processor.\n\nSeveral research papers confirm this approach. They highlight that a rational approximation with distinct real poles is chosen specifically because it \"readily admits a partial-fraction expansion thereby allowing the distribution of the work in solving the corresponding linear algebraic systems on concurrent processors\". This splitting of the problem is the foundation of the parallel algorithm. This method is favored as it allows for the implementation of high-order, stable schemes in a parallel computing environment, often without the need for complex arithmetic.\n\nTherefore:\n*   **Complex roots (A)** are often avoided in favor of real roots to prevent the need for complex arithmetic.\n*   **Stability analysis (B)** is crucial for ensuring the numerical method is sound, but it is a prerequisite for a valid algorithm in general, not the specific mechanism for parallelization.\n*   **Nonlocal boundary conditions (C)** describe a specific type of problem but do not represent the core principle that allows for the parallel conversion of the solution algorithm.\n*   The **linear partial fraction decomposition (D)** of the fractional approximation is the mathematical technique that directly enables the splitting of the computational work among multiple processors.\n\n<<<D>>>"
