    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we must first calculate its fraction relative to all other cobalt-containing species in the solution. This can be done using the provided stability constants and the concentration of the thiocyanate ligand.\n\nThe relevant equilibria in the solution are:\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, in this case, [Co(SCN)₂] (denoted as α₂), is given by a standard formula in coordination chemistry. This formula relates the concentration of the specific complex to the total concentration of the central metal ion.\n\nThe formula for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is:\nα₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nGiven the values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nWe can calculate each term in the denominator of the equation:\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, we sum these terms with 1 to find the total value of the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the dithiocyanato complex:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNext, we calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this fraction as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not required for this calculation, assuming that the given [SCN⁻] of 0.1 M represents the free equilibrium concentration of the ligand, which is a standard convention in such problems.\n\nThus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
