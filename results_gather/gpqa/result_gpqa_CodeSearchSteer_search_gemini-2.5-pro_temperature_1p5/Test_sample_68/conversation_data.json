    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average distance the $X^0$ particle travels in the bubble chamber before it decays. This distance is known as the decay length.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Concepts:\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$):** This is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame, given as $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n*   **Time Dilation:** Because the particle is moving at a relativistic speed in the bubble chamber (the lab frame), its lifetime in this frame will be longer than its proper lifetime. The lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is given by the time dilation formula: $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor depends on the particle's velocity and relates the energy and momentum in the rest frame and the lab frame. It's calculated from the particle's total energy ($E$) and its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n*   **Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It's calculated as $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity in the lab frame.\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The problem states the energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV. This is typically ambiguous and could mean either total energy or kinetic energy. However, interpreting it as kinetic energy provides a result consistent with the given options. The total energy ($E$) is the sum of kinetic energy ($K$) and rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total energy of the particle.**\nWe are given the rest mass of $X^0$ as $m_0 = 3.41 \\text{ GeV/c}^2$, so its rest mass energy is $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV. The problem states the energy in the chamber is 27 GeV. Assuming this is the kinetic energy ($K$), the total energy ($E$) is:\n$E = K + m_0c^2 = 27 \\text{ GeV} + 3.41 \\text{ GeV} = 30.41$ GeV.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the total energy and rest mass energy:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{30.41 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 8.918$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$).**\nUsing the time dilation formula with the proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s:\n$\\tau = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0 = 8.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 7.134 \\times 10^{-15}$ s.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the particle's velocity ($v$).**\nThe velocity can be found from the Lorentz factor. The term $\\beta = v/c$ relates to $\\gamma$ by the equation $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}$. Rearranging this gives:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{8.918^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.01258} \\approx 0.9937$.\nSo, the particle's velocity is $v = 0.9937c$, where $c$ is the speed of light ($c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$).**\nThe decay length is the distance traveled during the lab frame lifetime at velocity $v$:\n$\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau = (0.9937 \\times 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (7.134 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ s}) \\approx 2.127 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nAn alternative and often more direct way to calculate the decay length is using the formula:\n$\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}}{m_0c^2} = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times \\sqrt{8.918^2 - 1} \\approx 2.127 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### 3. Conclusion:\n\nThe calculated mean decay length is approximately $2.13 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The mean lifetime ($\\tau$) is the time by which approximately 63% of the particles have decayed, which satisfies the condition of observing \"at least 30%\" of the decays.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 2.08 x 10⁻³ m\nB) 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m\nC) 2.08 x 10⁻¹ m\nD) 2.08 x 10⁻⁹ m\n\nOur calculated value of $2.13 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is closest to option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The minor difference (~2%) is likely due to rounding or slight inaccuracies in the problem's given values.\n\n<<<B>>>"
