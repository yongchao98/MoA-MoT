    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first understand the relationship between the energy of emitted light and absorbed light.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Emitted Light:** The textile dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. We can find the color corresponding to this energy. The energy of a photon (E) is related to its wavelength (λ) by the formula E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. A useful conversion is E (eV) = 1240 / λ (nm).\n    *   λ = 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm.\n    *   A wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum.\n\n2.  **Relate Emitted and Absorbed Light:** The process described, where a substance absorbs light and then emits light at a lower energy (longer wavelength), is called fluorescence. A fundamental principle of fluorescence is that the emitted photon must have less energy than the absorbed photon because some energy is lost within the molecule before emission occurs. This means the absorbed light must have an energy greater than 2.3393 eV.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:** We need to find which color from the given options has an energy greater than 2.3393 eV. Let's look at the approximate energy ranges for colors in the visible spectrum:\n    *   **Red:** ~1.65 - 2.0 eV\n    *   **Yellow:** ~2.1 - 2.2 eV\n    *   **Green:** ~2.2 - 2.5 eV\n    *   **Blue:** ~2.5 - 2.75 eV\n    *   **Violet:** ~2.75 - 3.1 eV\n\n    Comparing these to our requirement (Energy > 2.3393 eV):\n    *   A) Yellow (~2.1-2.2 eV) is less than 2.3393 eV.\n    *   B) Violet (~2.75-3.1 eV) is greater than 2.3393 eV.\n    *   C) Red (~1.65-2.0 eV) is less than 2.3393 eV.\n    *   D) Blue (~2.5-2.75 eV) is greater than 2.3393 eV.\n\n4.  **Select the Best Answer:** Both blue and violet light have sufficient energy to cause the green fluorescence. However, the absorption band that causes fluorescence is typically close in energy to the emission band. Since blue is the next highest energy color after green, it is the most probable color absorbed to produce green emission.\n\nTherefore, the compound absorbs blue light, which has a higher energy than the green light it emits.\n\n<<<D>>>"
