    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Transcription Factor Function:** The protein must form a dimer (pair up with another subunit) to enter the nucleus and activate genes.\n*   **Mutation Y:** This mutation is in the dimerization domain, the part of the protein responsible for pairing up.\n*   **Dominant-Negative Effect:** This is the key concept. A dominant-negative mutation produces a faulty protein that not only is non-functional itself but also interferes with the function of the normal protein produced from the wild-type allele.\n*   **Mechanism:** In a heterozygous individual (with one normal and one mutant Y allele), both normal and mutant proteins are made. The mutant protein, despite its faulty dimerization domain, can still interact or bind with the normal wild-type protein. This forms a defective dimer (wild-type + mutant Y). This faulty dimer is inactive and essentially traps the wild-type protein in a non-functional state. This formation of non-productive protein complexes can be described as a form of protein aggregation. This process leads to an overall loss of function even though a normal allele is present. Research on mutations in dimerization domains of proteins like filamin C has shown that this can lead to pathological protein aggregation and disease.\n\nLet's analyze the other options:\n*   **A) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** Incorrect. A dominant-*negative* mutation causes a loss of function, not a gain of function.\n*   **B) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** Incorrect. If the mutant protein completely lost its ability to dimerize, it could not interfere with the wild-type protein. The wild-type proteins would be free to dimerize with each other, and the overall phenotype would be wild-type or, at worst, a recessive loss-of-function, which contradicts the \"dominant-negative\" information.\n*   **C) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** Incorrect. If the mutant protein were simply degraded, it couldn't interfere with the wild-type protein, similar to the reasoning in option B. While some mutations do cause protein instability and degradation, this alone does not typically create a dominant-negative effect; rather, the mutant must interact with and \"poison\" the wild-type protein.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is that the mutant protein binds to the wild-type protein, creating non-functional aggregates (dimers) and causing a loss-of-function phenotype.\n\n<<<D>>>"
