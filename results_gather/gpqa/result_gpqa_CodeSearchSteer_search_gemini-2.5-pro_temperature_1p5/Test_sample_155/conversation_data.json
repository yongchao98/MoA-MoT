    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. The reaction with mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to one face of the double bond. This stereospecific reaction converts the *trans*-alkene into a *trans*-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is achiral, the mCPBA can attack from either the top or bottom face, producing an equal mixture of the two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. This 50:50 mixture is called a racemic mixture.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Hydrolysis:** The epoxide ring is then opened by adding aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This reaction proceeds via an *anti*-attack, where the water molecule (nucleophile) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   The attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers. Thus, Reaction 1 yields a single product: the meso-diol.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. The *syn*-addition of mCPBA converts the *cis*-alkene into a *cis*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetrical and achiral, this reaction produces a single meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Hydrolysis:** The *anti*-attack of water on the meso-epoxide leads to the formation of two different products.\n    *   Attack at one carbon inverts its stereocenter, leading to (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon leads to the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    Since the attack is equally likely at both carbons, the products of Reaction 2 are a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Peak 1:** The meso-diol, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   The meso compound will be separated from the enantiomers because it is a diastereomer.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will also be separated from each other.\n    Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
