    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration) of toluene. The methyl group (-CH3) on toluene is an ortho-, para-director. To simplify the reaction sequence and lead to a single major product, we will assume the conditions are controlled to favor mono-nitration. Due to steric hindrance, the para-isomer is typically the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** p-Nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.**\nThis step involves the oxidation of the methyl group of p-nitrotoluene. A mixture of manganese dioxide and sulfuric acid is a strong oxidizing agent. While conditions can sometimes be controlled to yield an aldehyde, oxidation of a methyl group on an aromatic ring with such reagents typically proceeds to the more stable carboxylic acid. However, a plausible pathway for a multi-step synthesis problem involves the formation of an aldehyde, which can then undergo further well-known reactions. One possibility is the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene to p-nitrobenzaldehyde. Let's follow this pathway as it leads to a very common subsequent reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** p-Nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed-aldol condensation, specifically known as the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. Acetone has acidic α-hydrogens and, in the presence of sodium hydroxide (a base), forms an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens). The initial aldol addition product readily dehydrates (loses a molecule of water) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   The reaction yields 4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Product 3:** 4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The more stable *E*-isomer is the expected product.\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\nNow, we must determine the point group for the final product, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule consists of a para-substituted benzene ring connected to a conjugated `–CH=CH–C(=O)–CH₃` chain.\n2.  **Planarity:** To maximize the stability from the extended π-conjugation (from the nitro group, through the benzene ring, and along the butenone chain), the heavy atoms of the molecule (excluding the hydrogens of the methyl group) will tend to lie in a single plane.\n3.  **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this element.\n    *   **Proper Rotation Axes (Cn):** There are no rotation axes (C2, C3, etc.) that would leave the molecule unchanged. For example, a C2 axis through the bond connecting the ring and the chain would incorrectly position the nitro group and the methyl ketone group.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Assuming the planar conformation of the heavy-atom framework, the plane containing these atoms is a plane of symmetry. This plane reflects the top half of the molecule (including the out-of-plane methyl hydrogens) onto the bottom half.\n    *   **Improper Rotation Axes (Sn):** There are no improper rotation axes.\n\nSince the only symmetry element present besides the identity (E) is a single plane of symmetry (σ), the molecule belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
