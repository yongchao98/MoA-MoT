    "The initial calculation seems solid. The search results confirm the fundamental principles I've used.\n\n1.  **Exoplanet Transit Depth:** Multiple sources confirm that the transit depth (the dip in brightness) is given by the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area, which simplifies to (R_pl / R_star)². Specifically, source states: \"transit depth ... equals (R_p / R_star)^2\". This confirms Step 5 and 6 of my calculation.\n\n2.  **Starspot Flux Variation:** The brightness variation of a star due to spots depends on the spot's size (filling factor) and its temperature relative to the photosphere. Source gives a detailed formula `zj = 1 − Fs/F*`, where z is the \"deviation from the undisturbed photospheric flux\" and Fs/F* is the ratio of flux from the spot to the flux from the star, which is proportional to (T_spot / T_eff)⁴, assuming blackbody radiation. My formula for the amplitude, `Amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`, is a direct application of this principle. It calculates the total reduction in flux from the star's disk when a fraction `f_spot` of it is covered by cooler spots. Sources discuss how starspot activity produces these photometric modulations.\n\n3.  **Comparing the two phenomena:** The problem requires equating the amplitude of the rotational modulation caused by spots with the amplitude of a hypothetical exoplanet transit. This is a common method for contextualizing the impact of stellar activity on exoplanet detection. Source explicitly discusses how unocculted starspots can bias the measured transit depth, making the inferred planet radius smaller. This reinforces the premise of the question.\n\nThe calculation performed was:\n\n1.  **Calculate the amplitude of variation from the spotted star.**\n    *   Maximum Flux (immaculate hemisphere): F_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n    *   Minimum Flux (spotted hemisphere): F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴\n    *   Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n    *   Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\n    *   Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)\n    *   Amplitude = 0.20 * 0.51775\n    *   Amplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\n2.  **Calculate the equivalent exoplanet transit depth.**\n    *   Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n3.  **Equate and solve for R_pl / R_star.**\n    *   (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n    *   R_pl / R_star = √0.10355\n    *   R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThe calculation is correct and the underlying physics is confirmed by the literature search. The result `~0.32` strongly corresponds to option C.\n\nFinal check of the question:\n*   Star radius = Sun's radius (this is informational and not needed for the relative calculation).\n*   One hemisphere covered, filling factor 20%. My model of a \"dim\" face and a \"bright\" face is correct.\n*   Teff = 6000K, Spot Temp = 5000K. Correctly used.\n*   Goal: Find R_pl / R_star for an equivalent amplitude signal on an *unspotted* star. My setup is correct.\n\nThe answer is C.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compare the dimming caused by starspots to the dimming caused by a planetary transit.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Brightness Drop due to Starspots\n\nFirst, let's determine the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the rotating, spotted star. The star's brightness is at its maximum when the clean hemisphere faces the observer and at its minimum when the spotted hemisphere is in view.\n\nWe can model the flux (brightness per unit area) using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (Teff⁴).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is proportional to the temperature of the photosphere raised to the fourth power. Let's normalize the visible disk area to 1.\n    *   F_max ∝ Teff⁴ = 6000⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** When the spotted hemisphere is visible, 20% of the area (the filling factor) has a cooler temperature, while the remaining 80% is at the normal photospheric temperature.\n    *   Temperature of spots (T_spot) = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   The flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the hot photosphere and the cool spots.\n    *   F_min ∝ (0.80 × Teff⁴) + (0.20 × T_spot⁴)\n    *   F_min ∝ (0.80 × 6000⁴) + (0.20 × 5000⁴)\n\nThe amplitude of the light curve signal is the fractional drop in brightness from maximum to minimum:\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nLet's substitute the expressions for flux:\nAmplitude = (Teff⁴ - [0.80 × Teff⁴ + 0.20 × T_spot⁴]) / Teff⁴\nAmplitude = (0.20 × Teff⁴ - 0.20 × T_spot⁴) / Teff⁴\nAmplitude = 0.20 × (1 - (T_spot⁴ / Teff⁴))\nAmplitude = 0.20 × (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 × (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 × (1 - 625 / 1296)\nAmplitude = 0.20 × (671 / 1296)\nAmplitude ≈ 0.20 × 0.5177\nAmplitude ≈ 0.1035\n\nSo, the starspots cause a brightness variation with an amplitude of about 10.35%.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Size\n\nNext, we need to find the radius of a planet (Rpl) that would cause the same amplitude drop when it transits an otherwise unspotted star. The dip in brightness during a transit, known as the transit depth, is equal to the ratio of the planet's disk area (πRpl²) to the star's disk area (πRstar²).\n\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (πRpl² / πRstar²) = (Rpl / Rstar)²\n\nTo produce the same amplitude signal, the transit depth must equal the amplitude from the starspot modulation:\n(Rpl / Rstar)² = 0.1035\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (Rpl / Rstar):\nRpl / Rstar = √0.1035\nRpl / Rstar ≈ 0.3217\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n<<<C>>>"
