    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both stages of the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Dilution\n\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.02000 L\n    Concentration = 0.05 M\n    Moles = 0.05 mol/L * 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol\n\n*   **Dilution:**\n    The acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    New total volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L\n    **New concentration of acetic acid:**\n    Concentration = Moles / Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = **0.025 M**\n\n### 2. Titration Reaction\n\nThe reaction between acetic acid (a weak acid) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base) is:\nCH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n\n### 3. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **pKa calculation:**\n    The acid dissociation constant (Ka) is 1.85x10⁻⁵.\n    pKa = -log(Ka)\n    pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n*   **Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**\n    pH = pKa + log ( [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] )\n\n*   At this point, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is 25% to 75%.\n    Ratio = [0.25] / [0.75] = 1/3\n\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH ≈ 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477\n    **pH ≈ 4.25**\n\n### 4. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution's pH is now determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (a weak base).\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence:**\n    Moles of acid (0.001 mol) must equal moles of base.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Concentration of acetate at equivalence:**\n    Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    Moles of acetate formed = 0.001 mol\n    Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\n*   **Hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    To find the pH, we must first find the pOH by calculating the concentration of OH⁻ produced.\n\n*   **Kb calculation:**\n    Kb = Kw / Ka (where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C)\n    Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   **[OH⁻] calculation:**\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02)\n    x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **pOH and pH calculation:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻])\n    pOH = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH\n    pH ≈ 14 - 5.48\n    **pH ≈ 8.52**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of approximately **4.26** (rounding 4.25) at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
