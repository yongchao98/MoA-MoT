    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to find the energy of the transition. The molecule is initially in its fundamental (ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational (v=0) and rotational (J=0) quantum numbers.\n\nThe energy levels of a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model are given by:\nEᵥ,ⱼ = ħω(v + 1/2) + [ħ²/(2I)] * J(J+1)\n\nWhere:\n*   v is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   J is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   ω is the angular frequency of vibration (4 * 10¹⁴ rad/s).\n*   I is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\nThe problem asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" While the absolute lowest energy transition from the ground state would be a purely rotational one (from J=0 to J=1), the inclusion of the vibrational frequency (ω) in the problem data, combined with the provided options, strongly suggests that a rovibrational transition is intended.\n\nThe selection rules for an allowed rovibrational transition are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the next lowest rovibrational state that can be reached is (v=1, J=1).\n\nThe energy of the transition (ΔE) is the difference between the final and initial states:\n*   Initial state energy (v=0, J=0): E_initial = ħω(0 + 1/2) + [ħ²/(2I)]*0*(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   Final state energy (v=1, J=1): E_final = ħω(1 + 1/2) + [ħ²/(2I)]*1*(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is therefore:\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = ( (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I ) - ( (1/2)ħω ) = ħω + ħ²/I\n\nThis energy is related to the photon's momentum (p) by the equation ΔE = pc, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s). Thus, p = ΔE / c.\n\nHere are the steps to calculate the final value:\n\n1.  **Calculate the reduced mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    Using the conversion 1 amu = 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg:\n    μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n2.  **Calculate the moment of inertia (I):**\n    I = μR²\n    R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I ≈ 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n3.  **Calculate the energy of the transition (ΔE):**\n    The total energy is the sum of the vibrational and rotational energy changes.\n    *   Vibrational energy part: ΔE_vib = ħω = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J.\n    *   Rotational energy part: ΔE_rot = ħ²/I = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.21 x 10⁻²³ J.\n    The rotational energy part is more than 400 times smaller than the vibrational part and can be considered negligible in this context.\n    ΔE ≈ ΔE_vib ≈ 4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n4.  **Calculate the photon's momentum (p):**\n    p = ΔE / c\n    p ≈ (4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.9979 x 10⁸ m/s)\n    p ≈ 1.407 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis result is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
