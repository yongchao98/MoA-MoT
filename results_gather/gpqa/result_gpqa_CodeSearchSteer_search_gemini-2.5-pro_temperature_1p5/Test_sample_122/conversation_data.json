    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically concerning time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the known variables:**\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (proper time), `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   Calculate the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame, `d`.\n\n3.  **Apply the principles of special relativity:**\n    *   The distance `d` is the velocity `v` multiplied by the time `Δt` measured in the Galaxy's reference frame: `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation, the time `Δt` in the stationary (Galaxy) frame is longer than the proper time `Δt₀` in the moving (ejecta) frame. The relationship is given by the formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this value:\n        `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n5.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n    *   `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\nThis value is very close to 3,060,000 km. The small discrepancy arises from rounding. An alternative method often used in physics problems is to use a binomial approximation for the Lorentz factor when `v` is much smaller than `c`.\n\n*   **Approximation method:**\n    *   For small `x`, `γ = (1-x)^(-1/2) ≈ 1 + x/2`.\n    *   With `x = v²/c² = 0.04`, `γ ≈ 1 + 0.04/2 = 1.02`.\n    *   `Δt ≈ 1.02 * 50 s = 51 s`.\n    *   `d = 60,000 km/s * 51 s = 3,060,000 km`.\n\nThis calculation provides an exact match with option A.\n\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>"
