    "**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\nThis molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as substituted biphenyls. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and carboxylate groups) in the ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is sterically hindered. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, leads to a stable, non-planar conformation where the two rings are twisted relative to each other. If the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it will be chiral and thus optically active. In this specific molecule, the substitution pattern prevents the molecule from being superimposable on its mirror image, resulting in the existence of two enantiomers (optical isomers).\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\nThis compound, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is defined as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are inherently chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n**3. benzophenone:**\nThe chemical structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The molecule consists of a central carbonyl group attached to two phenyl rings. Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule through the C=O group and the bond connecting the two rings, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. While some highly substituted benzophenone derivatives can be made chiral, the parent molecule is not.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate:**\nDimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The double bond in the molecule prevents free rotation, leading to geometric isomerism (cis/trans). However, the *trans* configuration of dimethyl fumarate gives the molecule a center of symmetry. A molecule with a center of symmetry is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Consequently, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
