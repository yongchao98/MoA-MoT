    "### Analysis of the Problem\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to apply the principles of special relativity to calculate two quantities: the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.\n\n#### 1. Relative Speed Calculation\n\nThe two astronauts are moving in the same positive x-direction with speeds `v1 = 0.6c` and `v2 = 0.5c`. To find the relative speed of one astronaut with respect to the other, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let's find the speed of the first astronaut (v1) as observed from the second astronaut's (v2) reference frame. The formula is:\n\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is `0.14c`.\n\n#### 2. Total Energy Calculation\n\nThe total energy of a system of particles is the sum of the total energies of each particle. The total energy of a single particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by the equation E = γmc², where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\nWe need to calculate the total energy for each astronaut and then add them together.\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass: `m1 = 2m`\n*   Speed: `v1 = 0.6c`\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ1`:\n`γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)² / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n\nNow, calculate the energy `E1`:\n`E1 = γ1 * m1 * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5mc²`\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass: `m2 = 3m`\n*   Speed: `v2 = 0.5c`\n\nNext, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ2`:\n`γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)² / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`\n\nNow, calculate the energy `E2`:\n`E2 = γ2 * m2 * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641mc²`\n\n**Total Energy of the System:**\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of `E1` and `E2`:\n`E = E1 + E2 = 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc² = 5.9641mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is `5.96mc²`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately `0.14c`, and the total energy of the system is approximately `5.96mc²`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
