    "To determine the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$, we will use the formula for the standard deviation of an operator in a given quantum state:\n\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\nFirst, let's write down the matrices for the operators and the state vector provided in the problem.\n\nThe matrix for the operator $P_z$ is:\n$P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe state of the system, $|\\psi\\rangle$, is given by the column vector:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe corresponding bra vector, $\\langle\\psi|$, is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, denoted as $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.**\n\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nFirst, we apply the operator $P_z$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right) = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 0$\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$, denoted as $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.**\n\nFirst, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nApply the operator $P_z^2$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.**\n\nUsing the values we calculated:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
