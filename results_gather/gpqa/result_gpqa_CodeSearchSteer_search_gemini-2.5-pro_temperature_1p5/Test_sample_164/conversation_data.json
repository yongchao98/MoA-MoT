    "To determine the correct statement regarding the synthesis of branched polyethylene from a single ethylene feedstock using a dual-catalyst system, each option must be evaluated based on established industrial and chemical principles. The core of this process involves one catalyst that oligomerizes ethylene into short alpha-olefins (like 1-hexene or 1-octene), which then act as comonomers for the second catalyst to incorporate as branches into the main polymer chain.\n\n**A) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene. Chromium-based catalysts, which are key for this reaction, are very frequently activated by aluminum-based compounds like methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO). These activators, also known as cocatalysts, are crucial for generating the active catalytic species. Homogeneous ethylene oligomerization at metal complexes is often activated by organoaluminum co-catalysts.\n\n**B) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\nThis statement is plausible. Research has shown that some noble metal catalysts, particularly those based on palladium, can oligomerize ethylene. However, for large-scale industrial applications where cost-effectiveness is paramount, catalysts based on more abundant and less expensive metals like chromium, nickel, and iron are preferred. Therefore, while technically possible, the use of noble metals is not the mainstream industrial approach due to their high cost.\n\n**C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\nThis statement is correct. Group 6 (formerly VIa) contains chromium (Cr), which is the basis for the most significant industrial catalysts for the selective trimerization and tetramerization of ethylene to 1-hexene and 1-octene, respectively. These specific alpha-olefins are ideal for creating short-chain branches in polyethylene. The development of chromium catalysts containing specific ligands (like those with phosphorus and nitrogen donors) that are activated by co-catalysts like MAO was a major breakthrough enabling these processes. Phillips Petroleum was the first to industrialize ethylene trimerization to 1-hexene using a chromium-based catalyst.\n\n**D) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\nThis statement is also correct. Technologies that use dual-catalyst or tandem systems in a single reactor to produce linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) from only ethylene have been commercially implemented by companies in the United States. These systems couple an ethylene oligomerization catalyst with a polymerization catalyst. However, the term \"regular branches\" used in the prompt can be ambiguous. Industrial processes create LLDPE with a random distribution of branches, not perfectly regular spacing. If \"regular\" is interpreted strictly, this statement could be considered imprecise in a chemical context. When compared with statement C, which describes the fundamental and undisputed chemical principle enabling the technology, C is the more robust and scientifically central answer.\n\nGiven the options, statement C provides the most accurate and fundamental chemical principle behind the described process.\n\n<<<C>>>"
