    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is based on a set of simplifying assumptions about how a probe (like a lepton) interacts with a nucleus. Let's analyze the four statements provided:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** This is a core concept of the impulse approximation. It assumes that the complex interaction with the nucleus can be broken down into a sum of interactions with each of its constituent nucleons. This is sometimes called the single-nucleon interaction assumption.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This statement implies that the incoming probe and the outgoing particles do not have any additional interactions with the other (A-1) nucleons in the nucleus. This is a key feature of the *Plane Wave* Impulse Approximation (PWIA), which is the simplest form of this approximation. It essentially neglects initial and final-state interactions.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic:** This assumption pertains to the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, however, treats the nucleon as the fundamental entity of the interaction. While models of nucleon structure are important, they represent a different level of physical description and are not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation at the nuclear level.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** This is the \"impulse\" aspect of the approximation. It assumes the interaction happens over a very short timescale, so the potential binding the nucleon to the rest of the nucleus can be ignored *during* the interaction. This allows the nucleon to be treated as a free particle, albeit one with a momentum distribution determined by its initial bound state.\n\nBased on this analysis, the three assumptions that collectively define the impulse approximation are that the interaction involves a single nucleon (1), that the nucleon is effectively free of binding forces during the brief interaction (4), and in its simplest form, that there are no further interactions with the residual nucleus (2).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
