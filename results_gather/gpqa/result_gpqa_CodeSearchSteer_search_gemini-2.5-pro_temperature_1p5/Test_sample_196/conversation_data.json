    "Based on the analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and the chemical reaction, the final product is identified as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Compound X\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for carbon-carbon double bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   This data strongly suggests that Compound X is a carboxylic acid with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H):** This signal in the downfield region is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern is characteristic of a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The two protons at 8.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the two protons at 7.2 ppm are adjacent to an alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Signals:** The remaining signals describe the structure of the alkyl substituent:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂-) coupled to both a methyl group and a methine group.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** A methine group (-CH-) coupled to the adjacent protons and attached directly to the benzene ring, causing a downfield shift.\n    *   Assembling these pieces confirms the alkyl group is a **sec-butyl** group [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)].\n\n*   **Conclusion for Compound X:** Combining all the spectral information, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n### Step 2: Reaction and Final Product Identification\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reagents' Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a powerful reducing agent system. This system is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to their corresponding alkanes. The general reaction is R-COOH → R-CH₃.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring itself will not be affected by these reagents under typical conditions.\n*   **Final Product:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is converted to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nBy correctly identifying the starting material from the spectroscopic data and knowing the outcome of the reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the final product is determined to be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. This matches option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
