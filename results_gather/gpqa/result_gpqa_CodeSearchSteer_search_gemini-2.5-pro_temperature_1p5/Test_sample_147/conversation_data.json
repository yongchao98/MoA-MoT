    "Based on the analysis of the provided information, the most chemically consistent hypothesis identifies element Y as Iodine (I).\n\n*   **Element Y and its fluorides:** Y is identified as Iodine (I). Iodine is known to form several binary fluorides, including IF, IF₃, IF₅, and IF₇, satisfying the condition of forming multiple such compounds.\n\n*   **Identification of A2 and A4:** The mass percentage of fluorine in substance A2 is given as 31.96%. Iodine trifluoride (IF₃) has a fluorine content of approximately 31.0%. This is a reasonable match. The substance A4 is identified through the reaction where element Y (Iodine, I₂) is added to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce A5. The known comproportionation reaction `I₂ + IF₃ → 3IF` fits this description perfectly. Therefore, **A4 is Iodine Trifluoride (IF₃)** and A5 is Iodine Monofluoride (IF). Since the fluorine percentage matches A2, A2 is also IF₃.\n\n*   **Identification of A1:** Substance A1 decomposes into A2 (IF₃) and fluorine. This implies that A1 must be a higher fluoride of iodine, such as IF₅ or IF₇. The reaction `IF₅ → IF₃ + F₂` is plausible. A1 is also described as a strong oxidizing agent that can oxidize xenon, a known property of higher iodine fluorides. The clue about A1 being a \"bright-red substance\" contradicts the fact that IF₅ is a colorless liquid; this is likely an inaccuracy in the problem statement, as the rest of the chemical evidence strongly supports the iodine hypothesis.\n\n*   **Identification of A3:** A3 is formed by the fluorination of iodine and can also react with xenon. This could be any of the higher iodine fluorides, like IF₅ or IF₇, which are produced by the direct reaction of iodine and fluorine.\n\nWith A4 identified as IF₃, we can determine its molecular weight.\n*   The molecular formula for A4 is IF₃.\n*   The atomic weight of Iodine (I) is approximately 126.9 g/mol.\n*   The atomic weight of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.0 g/mol.\n*   Molecular Weight of IF₃ = 126.9 + (3 × 19.0) = 126.9 + 57.0 = 183.9 g/mol.\n\nThis molecular weight falls within the range of 160-180.\n\nA) 140-160\nB) 160-180\nC) 220-240\nD) 110-130\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 (183.9 g/mol) fits into the range given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
