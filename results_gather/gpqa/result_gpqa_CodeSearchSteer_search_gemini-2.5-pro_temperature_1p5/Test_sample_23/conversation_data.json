    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008).\n    *   Using approximate masses (H=1, C=12), this becomes y / (12x + y) = 0.1428. This simplifies to y ≈ 2x.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n can be an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z. This implies that all compounds in both mixtures share the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Methylcyclohexane (C7H14) is also a possible solvent. The mass fraction of hydrogen for any CnH2n compound is indeed 1/7 or ~14.3%.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Mixtures:**\n    *   **Mixture X** contains two equimolar liquids. It decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds (unsaturation). The molecules in X do not have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   **Mixture Y** contains two other equimolar liquids. It does *not* decolorize bromine water, indicating the compounds are saturated or aromatic. Hydrocarbon Z is one of the components of mixture Y.\n    *   The transformation from X to Y upon heating with platinum is described as a **disproportionation**. In organic chemistry, this can refer to a reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses hydrogen) and reduced (gains hydrogen). Often, this occurs via a catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n    *   Given that mixture Y is equimolar, a 1:1 reaction stoichiometry is required. This suggests an intermolecular hydrogen transfer between the two components of mixture X.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Structures:**\n    *   Let's assume the simplest case where Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the description of a widely used solvent.\n    *   Since all compounds must have the C6 carbon skeleton, we look for unsaturated C6-ring compounds for mixture X.\n    *   Mixture Y must contain Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) and another compound that doesn't decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The only candidate for this is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   So, **Mixture Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}**. It is equimolar and both are liquids under appropriate conditions.\n    *   The reaction must be: Component A + Component B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   To balance the atoms, the reactants A and B must also have C6 rings. To balance the hydrogen atoms: H(A) + H(B) = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   The components of Mixture X must be unsaturated C6-ring compounds that can react via hydrogen transfer to give benzene and cyclohexane. The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a non-conjugated cyclohexadiene like **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Let's verify this proposed reaction:\n        **C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)**\n        This reaction is balanced and represents a catalytic hydrogen transfer where the diene donates hydrogen and the alkene accepts it.\n    *   This hypothesis fits all conditions:\n        *   X is an equimolar mix of two liquids (C6H8, C6H10), both unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n        *   Y is an equimolar mix of two liquids (C6H6, C6H12), which don't decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y.\n        *   Hydrogenation of X (C6H8 and C6H10) and Y (C6H6 and C6H12) yields only Z (C6H12).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10).\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = (H atoms in C6H8) + (H atoms in C6H10) = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C. While a similar scenario with methylcyclohexane (C7) would lead to 22 hydrogen atoms (Option B), the cyclohexane (C6) case is the most fundamental and common example for this type of chemical problem.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>"
