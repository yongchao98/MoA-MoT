    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we must first express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates and then solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nWe can convert this to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the relations x = r cos(θ) and r² = x² + y².\n\nSubstituting these into the potential equation:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(x²)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis potential is that of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of potentials for each coordinate:\nV(x, y) = V(x) + V(y)\nwhere V(x) = 2kx² and V(y) = 1/2 ky².\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation is also separable under this potential. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies for the independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators in the x and y directions, E = E_x + E_y.\n\nThe energy levels for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(q) = 1/2 k_q q² are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency ω is √(k_q/m).\n\nFor the x-direction:\nThe potential is V(x) = 2kx² = 1/2 (4k)x². Thus, the effective spring constant is k_x = 4k.\nThe angular frequency is ω_x = √(k_x/m) = √(4k/m) = 2√(k/m).\nThe energy levels are E_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ(2√(k/m)) = (2n_x + 1)ħ√(k/m).\n\nFor the y-direction:\nThe potential is V(y) = 1/2 ky². The spring constant is k_y = k.\nThe angular frequency is ω_y = √(k_y/m) = √(k/m).\nThe energy levels are E_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ√(k/m).\n\nThe total energy spectrum is the sum of the energies in both directions:\nE = E_x + E_y\nE = (2n_x + 1)ħ√(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\nE = [(2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2)]ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
