    "The search results confirm my initial step-by-step plan. Specifically, source is a worked-out problem from Griffiths' \"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics\" that is identical to the user's question. It walks through normalizing the state vector and then calculating the expectation values for Sx, Sy, and Sz. Source also provides a clear formula for calculating <Sy> given a general spin state. The other sources reinforce the general principles of normalizing spin states and calculating expectation values using the bra-ket notation and matrix representations of spin operators. My initial calculation seems correct.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation again to be certain.\n\n1.  **Define the Spin State**: The given unnormalized spin state is a column vector:\n    |ψ⟩ = [ 3i ]\n          [  4 ]\n\n2.  **Normalize the Spin State**:\n    *   First, find the squared norm: ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = ([-3i, 4]) * ([3i],) = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.\n    *   The normalization constant is the reciprocal of the square root of this value, which is 1/√25 = 1/5.\n    *   The normalized state |χ⟩ is:\n        |χ⟩ = (1/5) * [ 3i ]\n                      [  4 ]\n\n3.  **Define the S_y Operator**:\n    *   The spin operator in the y-direction is S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y.\n    *   Using the provided Pauli-y matrix:\n        S_y = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ]\n                     [ i   0 ]\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value ⟨S_y⟩**:\n    *   The expectation value is calculated as ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩.\n    *   ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/5) * [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] ) * ( (1/5) * [ 3i ] )\n                                           [ i   0 ]           [  4 ]\n    *   Combine the constants: ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/25) * (ħ/2) * [-3i, 4] * [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ]\n                                                                   [ i   0 ]   [  4 ]\n    *   First, multiply the matrix and the ket vector:\n        [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ] = [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ] = [ -4i ]\n        [ i   0 ]   [  4 ]   [ (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ]   [ -3  ]\n    *   Next, multiply the resulting vector by the bra vector:\n        [-3i, 4] * [ -4i ] = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i² - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24.\n    *   Finally, bring in the constants:\n        ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/25) * (ħ/2) * (-24)\n        ⟨S_y⟩ = -24ħ / 50\n        ⟨S_y⟩ = -12ħ / 25.\n\nThe result matches option D. The calculation in source for the same problem also yields -12ħ/25 for <Sy>.\n\nTo find the expectation value of the spin operator S_y, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Normalize the spin state vector.**\n    The given spin state is |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4). We represent this as a column vector:\n    |ψ⟩ = [ 3i ]\n          [  4 ]\n\n    To normalize it, we first find the inner product ⟨ψ|ψ⟩. The corresponding bra vector is ⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4].\n    ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n    The normalization constant A is 1/√25 = 1/5.\n    So, the normalized state |χ⟩ is:\n    |χ⟩ = (1/5) * [ 3i ]\n                  [  4 ]\n\n2.  **Define the spin operator S_y.**\n    The operator for the spin in the y-direction is given by S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli Y matrix.\n    S_y = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ]\n                 [ i   0 ]\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩.**\n    The expectation value is calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩.\n\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (⟨ψ|/5) S_y (|ψ⟩/5) = (1/25) ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩\n\n    First, let's calculate the action of the S_y operator on the state vector |ψ⟩:\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ] = (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ] = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]\n                   [ i   0 ]   [  4 ]         [ (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ]         [ -3  ]\n\n    Now, we take the inner product with the bra vector ⟨ψ|:\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]\n                                  [ -3  ]\n             = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n             = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]\n             = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12]\n             = (ħ/2) * [-24]\n             = -12ħ\n\n    Finally, we divide by the normalization factor of 25:\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (-12ħ) / 25 = -12ħ/25.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 12*hbar/25\nB) -25*hbar/2\nC) 25*hbar/2\nD) -12*hbar/25\n\nThe calculated expectation value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
