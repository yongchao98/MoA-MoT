    "To detect the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) absorption line from neutral hydrogen clouds using ground-based optical telescopes, the light from a background quasar must be able to penetrate Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe Lyα transition has a rest wavelength (λ_rest) of approximately 1216 Å (or 121.6 nm). This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most UV radiation, effectively blocking light with wavelengths shorter than about 320 nm (3200 Å). For practical and efficient observations with ground-based telescopes, the wavelength should be even longer, often considered to be in the range of 350-400 nm (3500-4000 Å).\n\nDue to the expansion of the universe, light from distant objects is stretched to longer, redder wavelengths. This phenomenon is known as redshift (z). The relationship between the rest wavelength and the observed wavelength (λ_observed) is given by the formula:\n\nλ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\nTo find the lower limit on the redshift, we must determine the redshift required to shift the 1216 Å Lyα line just into the observable window. Using a conservative lower limit for the atmospheric cutoff of around 3500 Å to 3600 Å:\n\nz = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\nz = (3600 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 2.96 - 1\nz ≈ 1.96\n\nTherefore, the neutral hydrogen clouds must have a redshift of at least approximately 1.9 for the Lyα absorption feature to be detectable by ground-based optical telescopes. Observations of the Lyα forest are indeed typically conducted at redshifts z ≳ 2 for this reason.\n\nBased on this calculation, the closest answer is 1.9.\n\n<<<A>>>"
