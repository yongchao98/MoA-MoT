    "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can follow a two-step process. First, we establish a relationship between the equilibrium temperatures and the orbital distances (semi-major axes) of the planets. Second, we use Kepler's Third Law to relate the orbital distances to the orbital periods. The information regarding the planets' masses, the TTV discovery method, and the specific albedo value are not necessary for this calculation, provided the albedo is the same for all three planets.\n\n**Step 1: Relating Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (a) from the star. The formula is given by:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nThis relationship holds true when the star's properties (temperature and radius) and the planet's albedo are constant, which is the case in this system.\n\nFrom this relationship, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (i and j) is:\n\nT_eq_i / T_eq_j = √(a_j / a_i)\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\nUsing these ratios, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n*   For Planet 1 and Planet 2: `1.4 = √(a2 / a1)` which gives `a2 / a1 = 1.4² = 1.96`.\n*   For Planet 2 and Planet 3: `2.3 = √(a3 / a2)` which gives `a3 / a2 = 2.3² = 5.29`.\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1 (`a3 / a1`), we multiply the two intermediate ratios:\n\n`a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.3684`\n\n**Step 2: Applying Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). The law can be expressed as a ratio for two planets:\n\n(P_i / P_j)² = (a_i / a_j)³\n\nWe want to find the ratio P3 / P1. Using the ratio `a3 / a1` calculated in the previous step:\n\n(P3 / P1)² = (a3 / a1)³ ≈ (10.3684)³\n\nTo find P3 / P1, we take the square root of both sides:\n\nP3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) ≈ (10.3684)^(1.5)\n\nCalculating this value:\n\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.384\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
