    "To determine the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition for the wave function. The total probability of finding the particle within the specified range must be equal to 1. The problem states that the particles are only ever found between x=1 and x=3.\n\nThe probability density, which is the square of the modulus of the wave function `|Ψ(x)|²`, is given by:\n`|Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a²/(1+x) + 0.25`\n\nThe normalization condition requires that the integral of this probability density over the allowed region is equal to 1:\n`∫[from 1 to 3] (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx = 1`\n\nSolving the integral:\n`[a² * ln(1+x) + 0.25x]` evaluated from 1 to 3 = 1\n`(a² * ln(4) + 0.25 * 3) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 1) = 1`\n`a² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2) + 0.75 - 0.25 = 1`\n`a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1`\n`a² * ln(4/2) = 0.5`\n`a² * ln(2) = 0.5`\n\nNow, we solve for 'a':\n`a² = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n\nUsing the value for the natural logarithm of 2, `ln(2) ≈ 0.693147`.\n`a² = 0.5 / 0.693147`\n`a² ≈ 0.72134`\n`a = sqrt(0.72134)`\n`a ≈ 0.8493`\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
