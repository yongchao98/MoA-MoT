    "### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomers are isomers that readily interconvert, most commonly through the migration of a proton and a shift in the location of a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring structure with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Therefore, p-benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens to undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses alpha-hydrogens on the carbons situated between the ketone groups. It can undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol isomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). The enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic, meaning the equilibrium favors the enol.\n\nBased on this, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula for this ester is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a methyl group (–CH₃)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (–OH)\n    3.  a hydrogen atom (–H)\n    4.  an ester group (–COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism and exist as a pair of enantiomers (L and D isomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a *trans* isomer. The carbons of the double bond are each bonded to only three groups, so there is no chiral center. The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
