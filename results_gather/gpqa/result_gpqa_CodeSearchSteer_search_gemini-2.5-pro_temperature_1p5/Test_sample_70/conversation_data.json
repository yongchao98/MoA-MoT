    "The search results confirm my initial understanding of the physics involved.\n\n1.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The squares of the orbital periods of planets are directly proportional to the cubes of the semi-major axes of their orbits (P² ∝ a³). This is the fundamental relationship I need to connect the orbital period ratio to the semi-major axis ratio.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is derived by balancing the energy absorbed from its star with the energy it radiates away. The formula involves the star's properties, the planet's albedo, and its distance from the star (semi-major axis for a circular orbit). The search results confirm that for a given star and identical albedos, the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (a), so T_eq ∝ 1/√a.\n\nThe initial derivation steps were:\n*   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a4)\n*   From Kepler's Third Law (P² ∝ a³), we get a ∝ P^(2/3).\n*   Therefore, a2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3).\n*   Substituting this into the temperature ratio equation gives: T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt((P2 / P4)^(2/3)) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\n\nThe given orbital period ratios are P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n*   P2 corresponds to the value 2.\n*   P4 corresponds to the value 3.5.\n*   The ratio P2 / P4 is 2 / 3.5.\n\nNow, I will perform the final calculation.\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / (7/2))^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the cube root:\n0.8³ = 0.512\n0.85³ = 0.614\n0.83³ ≈ 0.5718\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.83. This matches option B. The logic is sound and supported by the search results.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1.  Establish the relationship between equilibrium temperature and semi-major axis: T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).\n2.  Establish the relationship between semi-major axis and orbital period using Kepler's Third Law: a ∝ P^(2/3).\n3.  Combine these to find the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period: T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3).\n4.  Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures using the given ratio of orbital periods.\n\nRatio: (T_eq4 / T_eq2) = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\nRatio = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) = (4 / 7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298... ≈ 0.83.\n\nThe solution is consistent.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?\". This means calculating T_eq4 / T_eq2. The derivation is correct. The calculation is correct. The answer corresponds to option B.To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we will use the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature, its orbital period, and its distance from the host star.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is determined by the energy it absorbs from its parent star. This temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis (a), which is the orbital distance for a circular orbit. The relationship is given by:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a4)\n\nTo relate the semi-major axes to the orbital periods, we use Kepler's Third Law. This law states that the square of the orbital period (P) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a³).\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nFrom this, we can express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period:\n\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nNow, we can write the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet_2 and Planet_4 in terms of their orbital periods:\n\na2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)\n\nSubstituting this expression back into the temperature ratio equation gives:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = √((P2 / P4)^(2/3)) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5. From this, we have:\n*   The period of Planet_2 (P2) corresponds to the value 2.\n*   The period of Planet_4 (P4) corresponds to the value 3.5.\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / (7/2))^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3)\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>"
