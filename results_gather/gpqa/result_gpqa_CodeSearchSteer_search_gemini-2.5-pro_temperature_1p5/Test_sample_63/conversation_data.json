    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the composition of salts A and B and the total number of atoms.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Gaseous Products\n\nThe mixture of gases formed from heating the salts was passed through three tubes sequentially. We can identify the components of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water absorbed.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change indicates that no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂) or readily soluble basic gases (like NH₃) were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    The oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas. Given the likely elements (N, H, O from salts), nitrous oxide (N₂O) is a strong candidate. The reaction is:\n    Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    According to this reaction, 0.05 moles of N₂O would react to provide the 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms, and this reaction would also produce 0.05 moles of nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    This remaining gas must be inert to all three tubes. Nitrogen (N₂) fits this description. This 0.1 mol of N₂ is the total amount collected at the end. It consists of any N₂ that was in the initial gas mixture plus the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction in tube №3.\n    *   Total N₂ = Initial N₂ + N₂ (from N₂O)\n    *   0.1 mol = Initial N₂ + 0.05 mol\n    *   Therefore, Initial N₂ = 0.05 mol.\n\nBased on this analysis, the initial mixture of gases produced by heating the salts was:\n*   0.2 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n### 2. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe gaseous products are water, nitrous oxide, and nitrogen gas. This product mix strongly suggests the thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n*   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture of salts A and B was equimolar. Let's assume 'x' moles of each salt were present.\n*   Decomposition of 'x' moles of NH₄NO₃ produces 'x' moles of N₂O and '2x' moles of H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of 'x' moles of NH₄NO₂ produces 'x' moles of N₂ and '2x' moles of H₂O.\n\nComparing this with our calculated moles of products:\n*   Moles of N₂O = x = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂ = x = 0.05 mol\nBoth equations yield x = 0.05 mol, which is consistent with the equimolar condition.\n\nNow, let's check the moles of water:\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2x (from NH₄NO₃) + 2x (from NH₄NO₂) = 4x\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 4 * (0.05 mol) = 0.2 mol.\nThis matches the amount of water calculated from the experiment in Tube №1.\n\n### 3. Verification of Total Mass\n\nLet's verify that the mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ equals the given total mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 2(14.01) + 4(1.01) + 3(16.00) = 80.06 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 2(14.01) + 4(1.01) + 2(16.00) = 64.06 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 80.06 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64.06 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 4.003 g + 3.203 g = 7.206 g.\n\nThis value is in excellent agreement with the 7.20 g stated in the problem. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Total Atoms\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 nitrogen atoms, 4 hydrogen atoms, and 3 oxygen atoms.\n    Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 nitrogen atoms, 4 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms.\n    Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
