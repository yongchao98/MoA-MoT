    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **State the problem and identify conserved quantities:** The problem describes the annihilation of a slowly moving antiproton with a proton at rest. This process results in four new particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$). In this particle interaction, both total energy and momentum are conserved.\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state:**\n    *   We have a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The antiproton is described as \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We can assume the proton is at rest.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is approximately zero.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The rest energy of a particle is given by Einstein's equation, $E = mc^2$.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938.3 MeV. An antiproton has the same mass.\n    *   $E_i = E_p + E_{\\bar{p}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}}c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final state:**\n    *   The annihilation produces four particles: $2A^+$ and $2A^-$.\n    *   We are given that the rest mass energy of each particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the four resulting particles will have the same kinetic energy and thus the same total energy.\n    *   The total energy of a single particle A is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles: $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the law of conservation of energy:**\n    *   The initial energy must equal the final energy: $E_i = E_f$.\n    *   $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n5.  **Solve for the velocity (v):**\n    *   First, solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Substitute the known energy values:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.564$\n    *   Now, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity, $v$. The velocity is often expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088} = \\sqrt{0.5912}$\n        $\\beta \\approx 0.769$\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of each particle A is approximately $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
