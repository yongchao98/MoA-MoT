    "To determine the maximum orbital period for the second planet, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the orbital inclination of the system.** The two planets share the same orbital plane, so they have the same inclination (`i`) relative to our line of sight. We can calculate this inclination using the data from the first planet.\n2.  **Determine the maximum orbital distance for the second planet.** A planet will exhibit a transit and occultation as long as its path takes it across the disk of its star. The maximum orbital distance for this to occur is when the planet just grazes the edge of the star, which corresponds to a transit impact parameter (`b`) of 1.\n3.  **Calculate the maximum orbital period.** Using the maximum orbital distance for the second planet and Kepler's Third Law, we can calculate the corresponding maximum orbital period.\n\nHere is the detailed calculation:\n\n**Step 1: Find the orbital inclination (i)**\n\nThe transit impact parameter `b` is defined as the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at mid-transit, normalized by the stellar radius (`R_s`). It is related to the semi-major axis (`a`), stellar radius, and orbital inclination (`i`) by the formula:\n\n`b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`\n\nSince the inclination `i` and the stellar radius `R_s` are the same for both planets, we can establish a relationship between their parameters:\n\n`cos(i) / R_s = b1 / a1 = b2 / a2`\n\nWhere `b1` and `a1` are the impact parameter and semi-major axis for Planet 1, and `b2` and `a2` are for Planet 2.\n\n**Step 2: Find the maximum semi-major axis (a2_max) for Planet 2**\n\nA transit is generally considered to occur if the impact parameter `b` is between 0 (a central transit) and 1 (a grazing transit). For the second planet to have the largest possible orbit while still transiting, its impact parameter (`b2`) must be at its maximum value, which is `b2 = 1`.\n\nUsing the relationship from Step 1:\n\n`b1 / a1 = b2_max / a2_max`\n`0.2 / a1 = 1 / a2_max`\n\nSolving for `a2_max`, we get:\n\n`a2_max = a1 / 0.2 = 5 * a1`\n\nThis shows that the maximum semi-major axis for the second planet is 5 times the semi-major axis of the first planet.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the maximum orbital period (P2_max) for Planet 2**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`). For two planets orbiting the same star, the relationship is:\n\n`(P2 / P1)² = (a2 / a1)³`\n\nNow, we can substitute the values for the maximum period and semi-major axis of Planet 2:\n\n`(P2_max / P1)² = (a2_max / a1)³`\n`(P2_max / 3 days)² = (5 * a1 / a1)³`\n`(P2_max / 3)² = 5³ = 125`\n\nNow, solve for `P2_max`:\n\n`P2_max² = 3² * 125 = 9 * 125 = 1125`\n`P2_max = √1125 = √(225 * 5) = 15√5`\n\nUsing the approximation `√5 ≈ 2.236`:\n\n`P2_max ≈ 15 * 2.236 ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period of the second planet is approximately 33.5 days. The radii of the planets and the star were not needed for this calculation, as it relies on the ratios of the orbital parameters.\n\n<<<A>>>"
