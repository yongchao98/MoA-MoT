    "Based on the detailed analysis of the two chemical reactions, the major products have been determined.\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, t-BuOK, selectively removes the only available α-proton from the C6 position of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one to form a kinetic enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The resulting product structure is named as a substituted propanoate, where the cyclohexyl ring is the substituent. When naming the ring as a substituent, the numbering starts at the point of attachment (the original C6). Consequently, the propanoate chain and a methyl group are at C1, the oxo group is at C2 (originally C1), and the ethyl and another methyl group are at C3 (originally C2). This leads to the IUPAC name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition, sometimes referred to as a conjugate addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, creating a nitronate anion. This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile). The final product is formed after protonation by water. For IUPAC naming, the main functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the carbon chain is named as a nitrile. The longest carbon chain, including the nitrile carbon, is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile. Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1. This places the methyl substituent at C3 and the nitro group at C4. Therefore, the correct name for the product is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nBy combining the correct products for both reactions, we find that A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate and B is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\n<<<B>>>"
