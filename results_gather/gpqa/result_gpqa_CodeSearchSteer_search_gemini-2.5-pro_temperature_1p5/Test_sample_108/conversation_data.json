    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   **Term Symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:** `1S0`\n*   **Total Spin `S(NN_initial)`:** `2S+1 = 1` → `S = 0`\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum `L(NN_initial)`:** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum `J(NN_initial)`:** The subscript '0' gives `J = 0`.\n*   **Parity `P(initial)`:** The parity of the NN system is given by `(-1)^L`. Here, `P(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Final State and Conservation Laws\nThe initial system decays into a final NN state and a particle X: `1S0 -> (NN)_final + X`.\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. We will assume particle X has spin `S(X) = 0`, as is common for emitted particles like pions in such problems. The lowercase letter (`s, p, f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X, `L(X)`.\n*   **Final State Parity:** The total parity of the final state is `P(final) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^L(X)`. Since `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L(NN_final)` and `P(X)=-1`, this becomes `P(final) = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`.\n\nWe must check three conservation/selection rules:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state (`J=0`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J(NN_final)`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`J(X)`). Since we assume `S(X)=0`, `J(X) = L(X)`. For the total to be zero, we must have `J(NN_final) = L(X)`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The initial parity must equal the final parity.\n    `P(initial) = P(final)`\n    `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L(NN_final) + L(X) + 1)`\n    This requires the exponent `L(NN_final) + L(X) + 1` to be an even number, which means **`L(NN_final) + L(X)` must be an odd number.**\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given that the final isospin is `T(NN) = 0`, we have:\n    `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This implies that **`S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be an odd number.**\n\n### 3. Analyze the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN State (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `L(X)=3`.\n1.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J(NN_final) = L(X)`? `3 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L(NN_final) + L(X)` is odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` is odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN State (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `L(X)=0`.\n1.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J(NN_final) = L(X)`? `0 = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L(NN_final) + L(X)` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` is odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. (FAIL - it is even)\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for a T=0 final state.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN State (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L(X)=1`.\n1.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J(NN_final) = L(X)`? `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L(NN_final) + L(X)` is odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN State (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` → `S=3`.\n*   This state is not possible for a two-nucleon system, as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Therefore, this transition is fundamentally not permitted because the final state cannot exist.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nWe have identified two non-permitted transitions:\n*   **B)** is forbidden by the Pauli statistics selection rule provided in the problem.\n*   **D)** is forbidden because the proposed final state (`7D1`) cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n\nThe question asks to make use of the specified conservation laws and the Pauli rule. Option (B) is the one that fails these explicit checks on the transition dynamics. Option (D), while impossible, would formally satisfy all three transition rules if such a state could exist. Therefore, the question is most likely targeting the violation of the transition rules themselves.\n\n<<<B>>>"
