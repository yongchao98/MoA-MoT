    "To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For a carboxylic acid, this peak usually appears between 1760-1690 cm⁻¹, which is consistent with the observed peak.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which typically occurs in the 1680-1640 cm⁻¹ region.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid group. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion (mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n### Assembling the Structural Features\n\nThe combined data points strongly to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   The carboxylic acid (-COOH) accounts for the broad FTIR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, the C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, the two oxygen atoms, and the m/z 45 fragment in the mass spectrum.\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) accounts for the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and the vinyl hydrogens observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Determining the Chemical Formula\n\nTo determine the correct formula, we calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DoU) for the proposed structure and compare it with the DoU for each of the possible formulas. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   A carboxylic acid group contains one double bond (C=O).\n*   A carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) is also present.\n\nTherefore, the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for the given options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n\nThe required DoU is 2, which eliminates options A and B. We are left with C₆H₁₀O and C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\nThe presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) necessitates two oxygen atoms.\n*   Formula C (C₆H₁₀O) has only one oxygen atom and is therefore incorrect.\n*   Formula D (C₆H₁₀O₂) has two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly matches all the spectral evidence for an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all provided data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>"
