    "### Analysis of the Reactions:\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis is a classic example of a cyanohydrin formation. The reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This reaction typically requires an acidic medium to protonate the intermediate alkoxide ion and to generate hydrogen cyanide (HCN), which can also act as the nucleophile. A source of protons like hydronium (H₃O⁺) or a mineral acid is necessary. Often, HCN is generated in situ by adding a strong acid to a cyanide salt like NaCN. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺** is a suitable reagent. NaHSO₃ is incorrect as it would lead to a bisulfite addition product, not a cyanohydrin.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction shows the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Cyanohydrins are well-known precursors to α-hydroxy carboxylic acids through hydrolysis. This hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base. The reaction mixture is usually heated with aqueous acid or base. Among the given options for reagent B, **HCl** is a strong acid and a common choice for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and would be significantly less effective for this transformation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, reagent A for the cyanohydrin formation is H₃O⁺, and reagent B for the nitrile hydrolysis is HCl.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<C>>>"
