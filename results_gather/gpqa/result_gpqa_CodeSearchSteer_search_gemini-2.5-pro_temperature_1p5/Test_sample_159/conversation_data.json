    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem `a` will approach a circle of radius `a` as the number of sides, N, approaches infinity. Therefore, the problem is to determine the angular separation between the first two diffraction minima for a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. The angular position of the minima in this pattern is given by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the minima is given by:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = (z * λ) / (π * D) = (z * λ) / (2 * π * a)\n\nwhere:\n*   `θ` is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `D` is the diameter of the aperture (D = 2a).\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `z` represents the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x).\n\nThe angular positions of the minima are determined by the values of `z`. We need the first two non-trivial zeros of J₁(x). From mathematical tables and physics resources, these are approximately:\n*   First zero, z₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   Second zero, z₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is:\nθ₁ = z₁ * λ / (2 * π * a) ≈ 3.8317 * λ / (2 * π * a) ≈ 0.610 * λ / a.\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is:\nθ₂ = z₂ * λ / (2 * π * a) ≈ 7.0156 * λ / (2 * π * a) ≈ 1.116 * λ / a.\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance *between* the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ - z₁) * λ / (2 * π * a)\nΔθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2 * π * a)\nΔθ = 3.1839 * λ / (2 * π * a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5066 * λ / a\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a (This is the position of the first minimum, not the distance between the first two)\nB) 0.500 λ / a\nC) 0.506 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ / a (This is the angular diameter of the central maximum)\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.506 λ / a matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
