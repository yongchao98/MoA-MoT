    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Define the initial state and operators**\n\n*   The initial state of the system is given by the column vector:\n    |ψ⟩ = `[-1, 2, 1]`\n*   The operator for observable P is:\n    P = `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   The operator for observable Q is:\n    Q = `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n**2. Normalize the initial state**\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the state vector |ψ⟩. The squared norm is:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\nThe normalization constant is 1/√6. The normalized state, which we'll call |ψ_norm⟩, is:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * `[-1, 2, 1]`\n\n**3. First Measurement: Probability of getting 0 for P**\n\nTo find the probability of measuring a certain value for an observable, we need the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of its operator.\n\n*   **Eigenvalues of P:** We need to solve the characteristic equation `det(P - pI) = 0`, where `p` represents the eigenvalues.\n    `det([[ -p, 1/√2,  0 ], [1/√2,  -p, 1/√2 ], [  0, 1/√2,  -p ]]) = 0`\n    `-p(p² - 1/2) - 1/√2(-p/√2) = 0`\n    `-p³ + p/2 + p/2 = 0`\n    `p - p³ = 0`\n    `p(1 - p²) = 0`\n    The eigenvalues of P are `p = 0, 1, -1`.\n\n*   **Eigenvector for p=0:** We need to find the eigenvector |p=0⟩ corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 by solving `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]` = `[0, 0, 0]`\n    This gives the equations:\n    1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x = -z`\n    So, the eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. For it to be normalized, `x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1`, which gives `2x² = 1`, so `x = 1/√2`.\n    The normalized eigenvector for p=0 is |p=0⟩ = `[1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability:** The probability of measuring P=0 is `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n    `⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩` = `[1/√2, 0, -1/√2]` · `(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n    = `(1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n    = `(1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n    `Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3`.\n\n**4. State Collapse**\n\nAfter measuring P=0, the system's state collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector:\n|ψ'⟩ = |p=0⟩ = `[1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`\n\n**5. Second Measurement: Probability of getting -1 for Q**\n\nNow we measure the observable Q in this new state |ψ'⟩.\n\n*   **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of Q:** The operator Q is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: `q = 1, 0, -1`. The corresponding normalized eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors:\n    *   |q=1⟩ = `[1, 0, 0]`\n    *   |q=0⟩ = `[0, 1, 0]`\n    *   |q=-1⟩ = `[0, 0, 1]`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability:** We want the probability of getting Q=-1. This is `Prob(Q=-1) = |⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩|²`.\n    `⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩` = `[0, 0, 1]` · `[1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`\n    = `0*(1/√2) + 0*0 + 1*(-1/√2) = -1/√2`\n    `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = (-1/√2)² = 1/2`.\n\n**6. Joint Probability**\n\nThe probability of measuring P=0 and then subsequently measuring Q=-1 is the product of the two probabilities calculated:\nTotal Probability = `Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\nTotal Probability = `(1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
