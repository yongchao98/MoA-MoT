    "Here is an analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol → A**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out in THF with potassium hydride (KH) followed by an acidic workup (H⁺). KH is a very strong, non-nucleophilic base. Its primary role here is to deprotonate the most acidic proton, which is the hydrogen of the hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming a potassium alkoxide.\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. A search confirms the structure contains a spiro center joining a cyclobutane and a cyclohexene ring, with a vinyl group and a hydroxyl group on the cyclobutane ring. The molecule's skeleton is a 1,6-diene system with an alcohol at a position that allows for a cascade reaction.\n*   **Mechanism:** These conditions are classic for an **anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement**. This is a type of-sigmatropic rearrangement that is dramatically accelerated (by a factor of 10¹⁰ to 10¹⁷) when the alcohol is deprotonated to an alkoxide.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** KH deprotonates the alcohol to form a potassium alkoxide.\n    2.  ** Rearrangement:** The alkoxide undergoes an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. This process involves the vinyl group and the double bond in the cyclohexene ring, leading to the opening of the strained cyclobutane ring and the formation of a ten-membered ring intermediate containing an enolate.\n    3.  **Transannular Cyclization:** This ten-membered ring intermediate is properly configured to undergo a rapid, intramolecular cyclization (an aldol-type reaction).\n    4.  **Final Product:** The cyclization creates a new bicyclic system. Subsequent protonation during the H⁺ workup yields the final, stable bicyclic ketone. This specific rearrangement is known to convert the spiro[3.5]nonane skeleton into a bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane skeleton. Therefore, product **A** is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol → B**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The allylic alcohol is reacted with acetyl bromide in the presence of LDA (lithium diisopropylamide).\n*   **Mechanism:** The product options, a rearranged carboxylate salt or carboxylic acid, strongly suggest an **Ireland-Claisen rearrangement**. This is a powerful stereoselective C-C bond-forming reaction.\n    1.  **Ester Formation:** First, the allylic alcohol ((E)-pent-2-en-1-ol) reacts with acetyl bromide to form the corresponding allyl acetate ester, `(E)-pent-2-en-1-yl acetate`.\n    2.  **Enolate Formation:** LDA, a strong, bulky base, selectively deprotonates the α-carbon of the acetyl group on the ester, forming a lithium enolate.\n    3.  ** Rearrangement:** This lithium ester enolate undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement through a chair-like transition state.\n    4.  **Final Product:** The rearrangement results in the formation of a γ,δ-unsaturated lithium carboxylate. The starting material `CH₃-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-OH` ultimately rearranges to form `lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate`. Since there is no mention of an acidic workup in the reaction conditions for B, the product remains as the lithium salt.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one\n*   **Product B:** lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate\n\nThis combination of products corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
