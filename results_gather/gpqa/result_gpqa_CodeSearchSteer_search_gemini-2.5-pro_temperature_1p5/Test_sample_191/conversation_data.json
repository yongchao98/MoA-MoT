    "This problem involves the principles of electrostatics, specifically concerning conductors and electrostatic shielding.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor, it induces charges on the conductor's surfaces. A charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity), and a charge of `+q` is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. This is necessary to ensure the electric field within the material of the conductor is zero, a fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor effectively isolates the outside region from the electric field created by the charge inside the cavity. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is produced *only* by the charges residing on the outer surface of the conductor. The combined electric field of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall is zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface is not influenced by the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity because of the shielding effect of the conductor. Since the outer surface is a sphere, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the surface to minimize electrostatic repulsion.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law (or the Shell Theorem), the electric field outside a uniformly charged sphere is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere. In this case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`, and it is uniformly distributed. Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is at a distance `L` from the center of the large spherical conductor, will be the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at the center.\n\nThe magnitude of this electric field is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe position of the cavity (`s`), the radius of the cavity (`r`), the distance from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `Î¸` are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
