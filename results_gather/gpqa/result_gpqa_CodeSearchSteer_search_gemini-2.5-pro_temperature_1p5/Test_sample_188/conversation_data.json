    "The question asks which of the given particles is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. Let's examine each one based on the search results.\n\n*   **Phonon:** Phonons are the collective vibrational excitations in a crystal lattice. The formation of a crystal lattice itself breaks the continuous translational and rotational symmetry of free space. Acoustic phonons are identified as the Goldstone bosons resulting from this spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. In superfluids, phonons are also the Goldstone bosons for both spontaneously broken U(1) particle number symmetry and Galilean symmetry. Therefore, phonons are directly associated with spontaneously broken symmetry as the resulting Goldstone bosons.\n\n*   **Magnon:** Magnons, or their quanta (spin waves), are excitations in magnetically ordered materials like ferromagnets. In a ferromagnet, the alignment of spins in a specific direction spontaneously breaks the spin-rotational symmetry of the system. Magnons are the Goldstone bosons corresponding to this broken symmetry.\n\n*   **Pion:** In the theory of strong interactions (Quantum Chromodynamics, QCD), there is an approximate global symmetry called chiral symmetry. This symmetry is spontaneously broken by the quark condensate. The pions are the resulting pseudo-Goldstone bosons. They are not perfectly massless because the original chiral symmetry is only approximate (due to non-zero quark masses), but they are significantly lighter than other similar particles. Hence, pions are a classic example of particles associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\n*   **Skyrmion:** A Skyrmion is a topologically stable, particle-like solution in a nonlinear field theory. They were originally proposed as models for nucleons (protons and neutrons) arising from the field of pions (which are themselves Goldstone bosons). A Skyrmion is not a Goldstone boson; it is a topological soliton. While the existence of Skyrmions is tied to a theory that exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking (e.g., the chiral symmetry breaking that gives rise to the pion fields), the Skyrmion itself is a distinct, non-perturbative object. The other three options (phonon, magnon, pion) are all Goldstone or pseudo-Goldstone bosons, which are the direct, massless (or low-mass) excitations predicted by Goldstone's theorem as a consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking. A Skyrmion is a different type of object, a stable topological configuration, rather than the quantum of a Goldstone mode.\n\nTherefore, the Skyrmion is the particle in this list that is not the direct Goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
