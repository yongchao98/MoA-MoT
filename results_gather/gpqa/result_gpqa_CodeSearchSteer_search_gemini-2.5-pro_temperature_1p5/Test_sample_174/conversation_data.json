    "To determine the correct option, we need to analyze the radiation from an oscillating spheroid. This type of radiation can be understood through a multipole expansion of the electromagnetic fields.\n\n### 1. Angular Distribution of Radiated Power\n\nAn oscillating charge distribution along the z-axis can be modeled using multipole expansion. The two lowest order and most common forms of radiation are electric dipole and electric quadrupole.\n\n*   **Electric Dipole Radiation:** The simplest and typically dominant form of radiation from an oscillating charge distribution is electric dipole radiation. For a dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the radiated power per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, is proportional to `sin²(θ)`. The maximum power (`A`) occurs at `θ = 90°` (where `sin²(90°) = 1`). At an angle of `θ = 30°`, the power is proportional to `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`. Thus, the fraction of the maximum power is `(1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\n*   **Electric Quadrupole Radiation:** If the electric dipole moment of the system is zero, the next dominant term is electric quadrupole radiation. For an oscillating linear quadrupole along the z-axis, the power distribution is often proportional to `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`. This function's maximum occurs at `θ = 45°`. The power at `θ = 30°` would be `sin²(30°)cos²(30°) = (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16`. The maximum value is `sin²(45°)cos²(45°) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4`. The fraction would be `(3/16) / (1/4) = 3/4`.\n\nThe problem describes a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis, which most naturally produces electric dipole radiation. Therefore, the `sin²(θ)` dependence is the most likely physical model. This leads to a fraction of **1/4** at `θ = 30°`.\n\n### 2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe radiated power also depends on the frequency (ω) of oscillation, and thus on the wavelength (λ), since `ω = 2πc/λ`.\n\n*   **Electric Dipole Radiation:** The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to `ω⁴`. This means the power dependence on wavelength is `λ⁻⁴`. This relationship is also responsible for phenomena like Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue.\n\n*   **Electric Quadrupole Radiation:** The power radiated by an electric quadrupole is proportional to `ω⁶`, which corresponds to a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁶`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the most standard and dominant radiation mechanism for an oscillating spheroid is electric dipole radiation. This model predicts:\n1.  A fraction of the maximum power at `θ = 30°` of **1/4**.\n2.  A functional dependence of the radiated power on wavelength of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nCombining these two results points to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
