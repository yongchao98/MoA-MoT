    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the answer.\n\nThe problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. We are given the formation constant (K_f) for the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Define the reaction:** The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is reversible. Since we start with the complex, we should consider its dissociation:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the Dissociation Constant (K_d):** The problem provides the formation constant, K_f (also noted as K_Ca-EDTA), which is 5x10¹⁰. The dissociation constant, K_d, is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an equilibrium calculation (ICE table):** Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium.\n\n    *   **Initial:**\n        *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 M\n        *   [Ca²⁺] = 0 M\n        *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0 M\n    *   **Change:**\n        *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = -x\n        *   [Ca²⁺] = +x\n        *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = +x\n    *   **Equilibrium:**\n        *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n        *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n        *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression:** The expression for the dissociation constant is:\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n\n5.  **Substitute equilibrium concentrations and solve for x:**\n    2x10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n6.  **Make a simplifying assumption:** The value of K_d is extremely small (2x10⁻¹¹), which indicates that the complex barely dissociates. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can assume that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    2x10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n7.  **Calculate x:**\n    x² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4x10⁻¹³)\n    x = 2x10⁻⁶·⁵\n    To simplify, we can write 10⁻¹³ as 10 * 10⁻¹⁴:\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    x = (√40) x 10⁻⁷\n    Since √36 is 6 and √49 is 7, √40 is approximately 6.3.\n    x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to 'x'. Therefore, the concentration is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nC) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C. The assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 is valid, as 6.3x10⁻⁷ is negligible compared to 0.02.\n\n<<<C>>>"
