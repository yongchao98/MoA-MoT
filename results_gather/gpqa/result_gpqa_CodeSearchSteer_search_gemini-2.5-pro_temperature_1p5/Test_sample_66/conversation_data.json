    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-component of orbital angular momentum for two electrons. The key to solving this lies in the principles of angular momentum coupling in quantum mechanics.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Identify the system and state:**\n    *   We have two electrons in a p-orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1`.\n    *   The combined 2-electron system is in a coupled state represented by `|l, m⟩ = |2, -1⟩`, where `l=2` is the total angular momentum quantum number and `m=-1` is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Identify the measurement:**\n    *   A measurement of the orbital angular momentum components `L₁z` and `L₂z` is performed.\n    *   We want to find the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue `-ħ` for *both* `L₁z` and `L₂z`.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the `Lz` operator is `mₗħ`. Therefore, an eigenvalue of `-ħ` corresponds to a magnetic quantum number `mₗ = -1`.\n    *   So, the question is asking for the probability of finding the system in a state where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\n3.  **Apply the rules of angular momentum addition:**\n    *   When angular momenta are coupled, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This is expressed by the quantum number relationship: `m = m₁ + m₂`.\n    *   This relationship is a strict selection rule. The coupled state `|l, m⟩` is a superposition of the uncoupled states `|l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂⟩`. A specific uncoupled state can only contribute to the superposition if its magnetic quantum numbers satisfy `m₁ + m₂ = m`.\n\n4.  **Check for conservation:**\n    *   The given total state is `|l=2, m=-1⟩`, so the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome is `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n    *   Let's check if the sum `m₁ + m₂` equals `m`:\n        *   `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n    *   We see that `-2 ≠ -1`.\n\n5.  **Determine the probability:**\n    *   The probability of measuring a system in state `|ψ⟩` to be in a particular eigenstate `|φ⟩` is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product, `|⟨φ|ψ⟩|²`.\n    *   In our case, we want the probability of finding the system in the state `|l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂⟩ = |1, -1; 1, -1⟩` when it is in the state `|l, m⟩ = |2, -1⟩`.\n    *   The probability is `|⟨1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1⟩|²`.\n    *   The term `⟨1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1⟩` is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. Because the condition `m = m₁ + m₂` is not met, this coefficient is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is `0² = 0`.\n\nThere is a zero probability of measuring `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1` simultaneously because it would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
