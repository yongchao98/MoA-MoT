    "This problem is a direct application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The \"laboratory\" is the stationary frame of reference (let's call it S).\n    *   The \"glass\" is the moving frame of reference (let's call it S'), moving at a velocity `v` relative to the lab.\n\n2.  **Determine the velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the lab (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light *within* the glass is determined by its refractive index, n. The formula for this is `u' = c/n`. The problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum, `c`, as 1. Therefore, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   The goal is to find the speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory (frame S), which we will call `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    The formula for adding collinear velocities in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Plugging these in gives:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    *   `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n    *   To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n    *   `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    *   `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result corresponds to the famous Fizeau experiment, which confirmed this relativistic effect long before the theory of special relativity was formulated.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) (1-n\\*v)/(n+v)\n*   B) (1+n\\*v)/(n+v)\n*   C) 1\n*   D) (1+n\\*v)/(n-v)\n\nThe calculated speed matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
