    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are described by the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. These potentials account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, `c`. Therefore, the field experienced at a point `r` at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, known as the **retarded time**, `tr`.\n\n2.  **Define Key Quantities and Relationships:**\n    *   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n    *   `r`: The observation point (field point).\n    *   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n    *   `tr`: The retarded time. This is the time at which the charge emitted the field that reaches point `r` at time `t`.\n    *   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   `d`: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point. Thus, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n    *   `d = |d|`: The magnitude of this vector, which is the distance the field has traveled.\n    *   The relationship between `t`, `tr`, and `d` is fundamental: the time it takes for light to travel the distance `d` is `t - tr`. Therefore, `d = c(t - tr)`.\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = v(tr) = ds/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n    *   `c`, `ε₀`, `μ₀`: Speed of light in vacuum, permittivity of free space, and permeability of free space, respectively.\n\n3.  **Recall the Standard Formulas for Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:**\n    The potentials are derived from Jefimenko's equations or, more commonly, by evaluating the retarded potential integrals for a point charge. The standard forms are:\n    *   Scalar Potential:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (R(1 - n · v/c))]_ret`\n    *   Vector Potential:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (R(1 - n · v/c))]_ret`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `[...]`_ret means all quantities in the bracket are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   `R` is the distance from the retarded position to the observation point. In our problem's notation, `R = d`.\n    *   `n` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the observation point. So, `n = d / d`.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the charge at `tr`.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Problem's Notation into the Formulas:**\n    Let's focus on the denominator term `R(1 - n · v/c)`.\n    Substituting `R = d` and `n = d/d`:\n    Denominator = `d * (1 - (d/d) · v/c)`\n    Denominator = `d * (1 - (d · v) / (dc))`\n    Denominator = `d - (d · v) / c`\n\n    Now substitute this back into the potential formulas:\n    *   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / (d - (d · v)/c)`\n    *   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q * v) / (d - (d · v)/c)`\n\n5.  **Manipulate the Formulas to Match the Options:**\n    The expressions in the options have a slightly different form. We can obtain them by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our derived formulas by `c`:\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d · v)/c)] * (c/c)`\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * qc / (c * (d - (d · v)/c))`\n        `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ * (cd - d · v))`\n        This is the same as `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ * (dc - d · v))`.\n\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [(q * v) / (d - (d · v)/c)] * (c/c)`\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (qc * v) / (c * (d - (d · v)/c))`\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * qc * v) / (4π * (cd - d · v))`\n        This is the same as `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * qc * v) / (4π * (dc - d · v))`.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The derived expressions are:\n    `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ * (dc - d · v))`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * qc * v) / (4π * (dc - d · v))`\n\n    Let's check the options:\n    A) Has `(dc + d · v)` in the denominator. Incorrect sign.\n    B) Uses the static potential formula and an incorrect relation for A. Incorrect.\n    C) Uses the static potential formula. Incorrect.\n    D) `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ * (dc - d · v))`, `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * qc * v) / (4π * (dc - d · v))`\n    This perfectly matches our derived expressions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
