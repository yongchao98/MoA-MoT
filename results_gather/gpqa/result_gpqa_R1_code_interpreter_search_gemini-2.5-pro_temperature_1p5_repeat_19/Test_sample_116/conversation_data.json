    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Definition of Optical Isomerism:**\nOptical isomerism occurs in molecules that are chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are:\n1.  The presence of a stereocenter (or chiral center), which is an atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n2.  The presence of axial, planar, or helical chirality, where the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, even without a specific chiral atom. A common example of axial chirality is atropisomerism found in certain substituted biphenyls.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound where the two phenyl rings are linked by a single C-C bond. The positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:** In biphenyl systems, if the ortho positions have bulky substituents, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is restricted due to steric hindrance. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism. If the substitution pattern is appropriate, the molecule can exist as two stable, non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) because the rings are forced to be non-coplanar.\n*   In this specific molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with large groups. This significant steric hindrance prevents the rings from rotating freely, locking the molecule into a chiral conformation. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound exhibits axial chirality due to atropisomerism and is therefore optically active.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:** We look for a stereocenter (a carbon atom with four different substituents). Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C2), which is the one bonded to the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   Group 1: A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   Group 2: A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   Group 3: A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   Group 4: A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   Since the central carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S isomers).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** Benzophenone has the formula (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:** The molecule is symmetrical. We can identify a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism. Its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:** The molecule is planar. All planar molecules have a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself), which makes them achiral. Furthermore, dimethyl fumarate possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is always achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and is not optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral, has a plane of symmetry).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral, has a plane of symmetry and center of inversion).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
