    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The system consists of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down). This gives a total of 2^3 = 8 possible configurations (microstates) for the system.\n\n2.  **Energy of the System:** The energy of a given configuration is determined by the formula:\n    E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n    where J is a constant.\n\n3.  **Partition Function:** The partition function, Z, is a sum over all possible microstates of the system. For each state `i` with energy `Ei`, its contribution to the partition function is `exp(-βEi)`, where β = 1/(kT).\n    Z = Σ_i exp(-βEi)\n    We need to calculate the energy for all 8 microstates and then sum their corresponding Boltzmann factors.\n\n4.  **List all Microstates and Calculate their Energies:** Let's list the 8 possible states (S1, S2, S3) and compute the energy for each.\n\n    *   **State 1: All spins up (+1, +1, +1)**\n        S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n        E = -J(3) = -3J\n        Boltzmann factor = exp(-β(-3J)) = exp(3Jβ)\n\n    *   **State 2: All spins down (-1, -1, -1)**\n        S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n        E = -J(3) = -3J\n        Boltzmann factor = exp(-β(-3J)) = exp(3Jβ)\n\n    *   **State 3: Two spins up, one spin down.** There are three such states:\n        a. (+1, +1, -1): S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1. So, E = -J(-1) = J.\n        b. (+1, -1, +1): S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1. So, E = -J(-1) = J.\n        c. (-1, +1, +1): S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1. So, E = -J(-1) = J.\n        All three of these states have the same energy E = J.\n        The Boltzmann factor for each is exp(-βJ) = exp(-Jβ).\n\n    *   **State 4: One spin up, two spins down.** There are three such states:\n        a. (+1, -1, -1): S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1. So, E = -J(-1) = J.\n        b. (-1, +1, -1): S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1. So, E = -J(-1) = J.\n        c. (-1, -1, +1): S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1. So, E = -J(-1) = J.\n        All three of these states also have the same energy E = J.\n        The Boltzmann factor for each is exp(-βJ) = exp(-Jβ).\n\n5.  **Group States by Energy (Degeneracy):**\n    *   Energy level E1 = -3J: There are 2 states with this energy (all up and all down). The degeneracy is g1 = 2.\n    *   Energy level E2 = J: There are 6 states with this energy (3 states with two up/one down, and 3 states with one up/two down). The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Partition Function Z:**\n    The partition function can now be written as a sum over the energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies.\n    Z = g1 * exp(-βE1) + g2 * exp(-βE2)\n    Z = 2 * exp(-β(-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β(J))\n    Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated expression Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option C.\n\n    A) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta) - Incorrect signs in the exponents.\n    B) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta) - Incorrect energy values and degeneracies.\n    C) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta) - **Correct.**\n    D) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta) - Incorrect energy values.\n\n<<<C>>>"
