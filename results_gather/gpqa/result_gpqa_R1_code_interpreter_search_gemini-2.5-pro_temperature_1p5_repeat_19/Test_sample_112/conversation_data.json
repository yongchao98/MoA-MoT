    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch, it's typically less broad unless there are specific circumstances, and it wouldn't be accompanied by the other peaks we see.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the characteristic region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, the 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ range is typical for the C=O group within a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The combination of a very broad O-H peak and a C=O peak strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The additional peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. A compound with a carboxylic acid group must contain at least two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which supports the finding from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a common fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxylic acid group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H)\n        *   Mass = 12.01 + 16.00 + 16.00 + 1.01 = 45.02\n    *   This fragment, [COOH]⁺, is a very common and characteristic fragment for carboxylic acids in mass spectrometry. This provides strong confirmation for the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectroscopic data, we have deduced that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid (contains -COOH) and also contains a C=C double bond.\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond.\n    *   The presence of a C=C double bond adds another site of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for C=O, one for C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group requires two oxygen atoms.\n\n    Now, let's evaluate the given chemical formulas:\n\n    *   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n        *   **Oxygens:** Has 2 oxygens, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement for one C=O and one C=C bond. This formula is fully consistent with all the data. An example is hex-2-enoic acid.\n\n    *   **B) C₆H₁₂O:**\n        *   **Oxygens:** Has only 1 oxygen. Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **DoU:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. Inconsistent with the presence of both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n\n    *   **C) C₆H₁₀O:**\n        *   **Oxygens:** Has only 1 oxygen. Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid and the strong evidence for it (broad O-H, m/z=45).\n        *   **DoU:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. While the DoU matches, the oxygen count does not.\n\n    *   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n        *   **Oxygens:** Has 2 oxygens, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **DoU:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is too low. It could account for the C=O of the carboxylic acid, but not the additional C=C bond required by the NMR and FTIR data.\n\n**Conclusion:** Only the formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence. It has the correct number of oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the correct number of degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both a carbonyl group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n<<<A>>>"
