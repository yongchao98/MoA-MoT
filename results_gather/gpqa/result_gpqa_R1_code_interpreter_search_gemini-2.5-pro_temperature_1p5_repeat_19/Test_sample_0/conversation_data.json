    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Principle:** The problem relates the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty in its energy. This relationship is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The principle states that for a quantum state with a lifetime `τ` (which is the uncertainty in time, Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty in its energy, `ΔE`, also known as the natural linewidth.\n\n2.  **State the Formula:** The uncertainty principle is mathematically expressed as:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    For practical calculations and order-of-magnitude estimates, we can use the approximation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n    where ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n3.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels, E₁ and E₂, to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference between their central energies must be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (their linewidths). If the energy difference is smaller, their energy distributions will overlap significantly, making them indistinguishable.\n    Condition for resolution: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainties (Linewidths):**\n    First, we need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of electron-volts times seconds (eV·s), as the lifetimes are in seconds and the final options are in eV.\n    ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    *   **For the first state:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For the second state:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Difference:**\n    Now, apply the resolution condition:\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    |E₁ - E₂| > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    To make the addition easier, let's write both terms with the same power of 10:\n    |E₁ - E₂| > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    |E₁ - E₂| > 7.2402 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.
