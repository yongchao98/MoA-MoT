    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Given:** The number of stars as a function of parallax (`plx`) is proportional to `1/plx^5`. Let's denote the number of stars as `N(plx)`. So, `N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   **To Find:** How the number of stars *per unit range of distance* (`r`) changes with distance. This quantity is a density, specifically `dN/dr`.\n    *   **Relationship to connect them:** I need the fundamental relationship between parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Recall/Search for the key relationship:**\n    *   I know from basic astronomy that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The standard definition is that a star at a distance of 1 parsec has a parallax of 1 arcsecond.\n    *   So, `plx = 1/r` or `plx ∝ 1/r`. This is the crucial link.\n\n3.  **Step-by-step Derivation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Express the number of stars in terms of distance.**\n        *   We are given `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n        *   We know `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n        *   Substitute the second relationship into the first one.\n        *   `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n        *   `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n        *   `N ∝ r^5`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Interpret what `N ∝ r^5` means.**\n        *   This expression, `N(r)`, represents the *total* number of stars observed out to a distance `r`. It's a cumulative count. For example, the total number of stars within a sphere of radius 100 parsecs is proportional to `100^5`.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Address the specific question.**\n        *   The question asks for \"the number of stars... *per unit range of distance*\". This isn't the total number `N(r)`, but the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `r`. Mathematically, this is the rate of change of the total number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN/dr`.\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the derivative.**\n        *   We have the proportionality `N ∝ r^5`. Let's write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`: `N(r) = k * r^5`.\n        *   Now, differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n        *   `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n        *   Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`):\n        *   `dN/dr = k * (5 * r^(5-1))`\n        *   `dN/dr = 5k * r^4`\n\n    *   **Step 5: Determine the final proportionality.**\n        *   From the result `dN/dr = 5k * r^4`, we can see that `dN/dr` is proportional to `r^4`.\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n4.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) ~ r^2\n    *   B) ~ r^5\n    *   C) ~ r^3\n    *   D) ~ r^4\n\n    My derived relationship `dN/dr ∝ r^4` matches option D.\n\n5.  **Final check:** The logic is sound. The steps correctly translate the given information about parallax into a function of distance, and then correctly interpret \"number of stars per unit range of distance\" as the derivative `dN/dr`. The calculation is straightforward. The answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
