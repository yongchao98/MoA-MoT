    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Potential:**\n    The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. \"Isotropic\" means the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all directions.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The Hamiltonian for this system can be separated in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$, where $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. The potential becomes $V(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$, which is the sum of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillator potentials.\n\n    The energy eigenvalue of a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\n    For the 3D system, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    We can define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n$ can be any non-negative integer ($n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$). The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    We need to find the energy for the different states in increasing order of energy (which corresponds to increasing $n$).\n    *   **Ground State:** $n = 0$. Energy is $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $n = 1$. Energy is $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $n = 2$. Energy is $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $n = 3$. Energy is $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    So, the value of the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same energy. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose three non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n$.\n\n    For the third excited state, we need to find the number of integer solutions to:\n    $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$, with $n_x, n_y, n_z \\ge 0$.\n\n    We can list the possible combinations $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n    *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) --- (3 states)\n    *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) --- (6 states)\n    *   Permutations of (1, 1, 1): (1, 1, 1) --- (1 state)\n\n    The total number of combinations (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    This means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the same energy eigenvalue $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    *Alternatively, one can use the general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator:*\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated energy for the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    The calculated degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3 - Incorrect energy and degeneracy.\n    B) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3 - Correct energy, but incorrect degeneracy.\n    C) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10 - Incorrect energy.\n    D) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 10 - Correct energy and correct degeneracy.\n\n<<<D>>>"
