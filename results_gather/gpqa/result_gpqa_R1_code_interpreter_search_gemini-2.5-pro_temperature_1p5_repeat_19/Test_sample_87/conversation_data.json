    "*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the experimental setup and observations.**\n    *   **Antigen Delivery:** GFP-tagged rotavirus inner capsid proteins (the antigen) are delivered orally. This means the primary immune response will occur in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).\n    *   **Location of Response:** Fluorescence is seen in Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a critical component of GALT and are secondary lymphoid organs where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated. The presence of fluorescence confirms the antigen has reached its target site.\n    *   **Cellular Response:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated from these Peyer's patches. In a secondary lymphoid organ, upon encountering an antigen, specific B and T lymphocytes that recognize the antigen undergo rapid proliferation (clonal expansion). This typically happens within specialized structures called germinal centers.\n    *   **Genetic Observation:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" from these proliferating cells shows \"high variability.\" The variable heavy chain gene is the part of the B cell receptor (and subsequent antibody) that binds to the antigen.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the potential processes listed in the options in the context of the observations.**\n    *   **A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) *after* they have encountered an antigen. SHM intentionally introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). The purpose of this is to generate variant B cell receptors, some of which will have a higher affinity for the antigen. These high-affinity B cells are then preferentially selected to survive and proliferate further (a process called affinity maturation). This process perfectly explains the \"high variability\" observed in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of the \"proliferating cell population\" in the \"Peyer's patches.\"\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, not the *variable* region. This switches the antibody class (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is common for mucosal responses), changing its effector function but not its antigen-binding specificity. While CSR is likely also happening in these cells, it does not explain the variability in the *variable* region.\n    *   **C) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, a cascade of proteins that helps clear pathogens. It is an effector mechanism and is not involved in generating genetic diversity in B cell receptors.\n    *   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that initially creates the diverse repertoire of B cell receptors. It occurs in the *primary* lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells) during their development, *before* they ever encounter an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening in mature, proliferating B cells in a *secondary* lymphoid organ in response to an antigen. Therefore, V(D)J recombination has already occurred long before the events described. The high variability observed in a specific, clonally expanding population is due to a subsequent, antigen-driven process.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude based on the analysis.**\n    The key observation is high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating B cell population within a secondary lymphoid organ following antigen stimulation. This is the definition of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
