    "*   **Analyze the fundamental assumptions of SMEFT:** The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a quantum field theory that extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators. This construction is based on a set of fundamental principles.\n*   **Spacetime Symmetries (Lorentz and Poincare):** SMEFT is a relativistic quantum field theory. As such, it is required to be invariant under the symmetries of spacetime as described by special relativity. This group of symmetries is the Poincare group, which includes Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) and spacetime translations. Therefore, both Lorentz symmetry (1) and Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian.\n*   **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory. It states that any local, relativistic quantum field theory that is invariant under Lorentz transformations will also be invariant under the combined transformation of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed to be a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must necessarily respect CPT symmetry (4).\n*   **CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry (the combination of Charge Conjugation and Parity) is known to be violated in the Standard Model, specifically in the weak interactions involving quarks (observed in Kaon and B-meson systems). Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it must be able to describe these known physical phenomena. Furthermore, the higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT can introduce new sources of CP violation beyond what is present in the SM. Therefore, CP symmetry (3) is *not* a required symmetry of SMEFT operators; in fact, SMEFT is often used to study and constrain potential new sources of CP violation.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Lorentz Symmetry (1): Must be respected.\n    *   Poincare Symmetry (2): Must be respected.\n    *   CP Symmetry (3): Is not a required symmetry.\n    *   CPT Symmetry (4): Must be respected as a consequence of Lorentz invariance and locality.\n\n    Therefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
