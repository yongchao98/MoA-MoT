    "This problem requires us to identify which mutation would most likely inactivate a gene responsible for producing an anti-nutritional compound. The most effective way to inactivate a gene is to introduce a mutation that prevents the formation of a full-length, functional protein. Let's analyze the effects of each mutation on the gene's protein-coding sequence.\n\nThe original gene sequence starts with `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`.\n*   `ATG` is the start codon, coding for Methionine (Met).\n*   `TTT` codes for Phenylalanine (Phe).\n*   `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu).\n*   `GCT` codes for Alanine (Ala).\n*   And so on. The initial amino acid sequence is Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\nA **nonsense mutation**, which changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (like TAA, TAG, or TGA), is the most likely to cause a complete loss of function. This is because it prematurely terminates protein synthesis, leading to a truncated and non-functional protein.\n\nLet's examine each mutant:\n\n1.  **Intact Gene:**\n    `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT ... -3’`\n    Codons: `ATG`, `TTT`, `CTC`\n    Amino Acids: Met, Phe, Leu\n\n2.  **Mutant 1:**\n    `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... -3’`\n    Changes: `TTT` -> `TTC` and `CTC` -> `TAC`\n    *   `TTC` still codes for Phenylalanine (Phe), so the first change is a **silent mutation**.\n    *   `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**, changing one amino acid (Leu -> Tyr). This might or might not inactivate the protein.\n\n3.  **Mutant 2:**\n    `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’`\n    Changes: `TTT` -> `TTC` and `CTC` -> `TAA`\n    *   `TTC` still codes for Phenylalanine (a silent mutation).\n    *   `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid, producing only a tiny, non-functional dipeptide (Met-Phe). This is highly likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n4.  **Mutant 3:**\n    `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ... -3’`\n    Changes: `CTC` -> `TAC`\n    *   `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation** (Leu -> Tyr), similar to one of the changes in Mutant 1. It is not guaranteed to inactivate the protein.\n\n5.  **Mutant 4:**\n    This sequence appears to have a deletion (`GGT` is missing after `GCT`), which would cause a **frameshift mutation**. This type of mutation alters the entire downstream reading frame and is also very likely to inactivate the protein. However, when comparing the options, a nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) is the most direct and certain way to terminate protein production presented. The introduction of an immediate stop codon is a classic and definitive method for gene knockout.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) very early in the gene's coding sequence. This will result in a severely truncated and non-functional protein, thus being the most probable mutation to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
