    "This problem requires understanding the stereochemical outcomes of two reaction sequences and how the resulting products are analyzed using different types of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule due to a C2 rotational axis of symmetry.\n        ```\n          Et   H\n           \\  /\n            C==C\n           /  \\\n          H   Et\n        (Et = CH2CH3)\n        ```\n    *   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n        *   The syn-addition of oxygen to the *trans*-alkene will produce a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides. Attacking from the top face gives one enantiomer (trans-(4R,5R)-epoxyoctane), and attacking from the bottom face gives the other (trans-(4S,5S)-epoxyoctane).\n    *   **Step 2: Aqueous acid treatment (H3O+).** This step is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen followed by a backside (anti-attack) by a water molecule. This overall sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is equivalent to an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** An *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n        *   Let's trace this: Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide via anti-attack gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide also gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. These are the same achiral, meso compound.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, the meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule due to a plane of symmetry.\n        ```\n          Et   Et\n           \\  /\n            C==C\n           /  \\\n          H   H\n        ```\n    *   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This is a *syn*-addition.\n        *   The syn-addition of oxygen to the *cis*-alkene will produce a *meso* epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane). Since the starting alkene is achiral and has a plane of symmetry, attack from the top or bottom face results in the same, single meso product ((4R,5S)-epoxyoctane).\n    *   **Step 2: Aqueous acid treatment (H3O+).** This is an *anti*-attack of water on the protonated epoxide.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** An *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n        *   Let's trace this: The meso-epoxide has two enantiotopic carbon atoms. Backside attack of water on one carbon (e.g., C4) will give one enantiomer of the diol, (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack on the other carbon (C5) will give the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Since the transition states for these two attacks are enantiomeric, they occur at equal rates, producing a 50:50 racemic mixture.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n3.  **Combine and Analyze the Product Mixture:**\n    *   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n        2.  **(4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n        3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n    *   The relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n        *   (4R,4R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n        *   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,4R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n4.  **HPLC Analysis:**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n        *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated by an achiral column. The (4R,4R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n        *   **Result:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**. One for the racemic mixture and one for the meso compound.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n        *   The chiral column will separate the enantiomeric pair, (4R,4R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into **two separate peaks**.\n        *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a unique retention time and will appear as its own peak.\n        *   **Result:** The chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**, one for each of the three stereoisomers in the mixture.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** on the standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
