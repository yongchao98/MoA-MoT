    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the chemical reaction taking place. We are dissolving a sparingly soluble base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)3), in a strong monobasic acid (which we can represent as H+). This is a neutralization reaction.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\nFe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThis equation shows that for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 dissolved, 3 moles of H+ are consumed.\n\n**2. Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nWe need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are in the 0.1 g sample. To do this, we first calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3.\n*   Molar mass of Iron (Fe) ≈ 55.845 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 15.999 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n\nMolar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles:\nMoles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 moles\n\n**3. Calculate the Stoichiometric Amount of Acid**\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we know that 3 moles of H+ are required to react with 1 mole of Fe(OH)3.\nMoles of H+ required for reaction = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\nMoles of H+ required for reaction = 3 * 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.002807 moles\n\nThis is the amount of H+ needed just to neutralize the Fe(OH)3. To keep it dissolved, the solution must remain acidic, meaning there will be some excess H+ ions remaining in the solution, which will determine the final pH.\n\n**4. Minimum Volume of Acid**\n\nThe minimum volume of the 0.1 M acid required just for the neutralization reaction is:\nVolume = Moles / Concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L\nConverting to cm³: 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³\n\nSince the final solution must be acidic to prevent Fe(OH)3 from precipitating, the total volume of acid added must be greater than 28.07 cm³. This allows us to immediately eliminate options C (20.40 cm³) and D (28.05 cm³) as they don't provide enough acid even for the basic neutralization.\n\n**5. Test the Remaining Options for Consistency**\n\nWe are left with options A and B. We can test them by seeing if the given volume of acid results in the given pH.\n\n**Testing Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n1.  **Total Moles of H+ Added:**\n    Volume of acid = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    Moles of H+ added = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = 0.003009 moles.\n\n2.  **Moles of H+ in Excess:**\n    The excess H+ is the amount left after the neutralization reaction.\n    Excess H+ = Total H+ added - H+ reacted\n    Excess H+ = 0.003009 mol - 0.002807 mol = 0.000202 moles.\n\n3.  **Final [H⁺] and pH:**\n    This excess amount of H+ is present in the total final volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    Final [H⁺] = Excess Moles / Total Volume = 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\n\n    Now, calculate the pH from this concentration:\n    pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.00202) ≈ 2.695\n\nThis calculated pH of 2.695 is an excellent match for the pH of 2.69 given in option A. The minor difference is due to rounding in the problem's values.\n\n**Testing Option B: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n\n1.  **Total Moles of H+ Added:**\n    Volume of acid = 32.14 cm³ = 0.03214 L\n    Moles of H+ added = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = 0.003214 moles.\n\n2.  **Moles of H+ in Excess:**\n    Excess H+ = 0.003214 mol - 0.002807 mol = 0.000407 moles.\n\n3.  **Final [H⁺] and pH:**\n    Final [H⁺] = 0.000407 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00407 M.\n    pH = -log₁₀(0.00407) ≈ 2.39\n\nThis calculated pH of 2.39 does not match the pH of 3.16 given in option B. Therefore, option B is inconsistent and incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically checking the options, we find that only option A provides a volume of acid and a pH value that are chemically and mathematically consistent with each other based on the initial conditions of the problem.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation for option A.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given information ---\nmass_feoh3 = 0.1  # g\ntotal_volume = 0.1  # L (100 cm3)\nacid_concentration = 0.1  # M\n\n# --- Constants ---\nmm_feoh3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008)  # g/mol\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# Moles of Fe(OH)3\nmoles_feoh3 = mass_feoh3 / mm_feoh3\n\n# Moles of H+ needed for stoichiometric reaction\nmoles_h_reacted = 3 * moles_feoh3\n\n# --- Test Option A ---\noption_a_vol_cm3 = 30.09\noption_a_vol_L = option_a_vol_cm3 / 1000\n\n# Moles of H+ added based on the volume in Option A\nmoles_h_added = acid_concentration * option_a_vol_L\n\n# Moles of H+ left in excess after reaction\nmoles_h_excess = moles_h_added - moles_h_reacted\n\n# Final concentration of H+ in the 100 cm3 solution\nfinal_h_conc = moles_h_excess / total_volume\n\n# Calculated pH from the final H+ concentration\ncalculated_ph = -math.log10(final_h_conc)\n\nprint(f\"For Option A (V={option_a_vol_cm3} cm3), the calculated pH is {calculated_ph:.2f}.\")\nprint(f\"The pH given in Option A is 2.69.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "The analysis is correct.\n\n**1. Stoichiometric Calculation:**\nFirst, we determine the amount of strong acid (H⁺) needed to react completely with the iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃).\n\n*   **Reaction:** Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** 55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol\n*   **Moles of H⁺ needed for reaction:** According to the 1:3 stoichiometry, we need 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n    Moles H⁺ = 3 * 0.0009356 mol = 0.002807 mol\n\n**2. Evaluate Options Based on Stoichiometry:**\nWe can calculate the moles of H⁺ provided by the acid in each option. The acid volume must be added to a solvent (presumably water) to reach the final 100 cm³ total volume. The moles of H⁺ are calculated as `Volume (L) * Concentration (M)`.\n\n*   **A)** 0.03009 L * 0.1 M = 0.003009 mol H⁺\n*   **B)** 0.03214 L * 0.1 M = 0.003214 mol H⁺\n*   **C)** 0.02040 L * 0.1 M = 0.002040 mol H⁺\n*   **D)** 0.02805 L * 0.1 M = 0.002805 mol H⁺\n\nTo dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ *and* have an acidic final solution (a pH < 7), the moles of H⁺ added must be *greater* than the moles required for the reaction (0.002807 mol).\n\n*   Option C (0.002040 mol) is insufficient.\n*   Option D (0.002805 mol) is just barely insufficient.\n*   Options A and B both provide enough acid to dissolve the solid and leave an excess.\n\n**3. Check for Consistency (pH calculation):**\nNow we check if the excess acid in options A and B results in the stated pH. The final volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n\n*   **Test Option A:**\n    *   Moles H⁺ added = 0.003009 mol\n    *   Moles H⁺ reacted = 0.002807 mol\n    *   Moles H⁺ excess = 0.003009 - 0.002807 = 0.000202 mol\n    *   Final [H⁺] = Moles excess / Total Volume = 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M\n    *   **Calculated pH** = -log₁₀(0.00202) ≈ 2.695\n    *   This matches the given pH of 2.69 very closely.\n\n*   **Test Option B:**\n    *   Moles H⁺ added = 0.003214 mol\n    *   Moles H⁺ reacted = 0.002807 mol\n    *   Moles H⁺ excess = 0.003214 - 0.002807 = 0.000407 mol\n    *   Final [H⁺] = 0.000407 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00407 M\n    *   **Calculated pH** = -log₁₀(0.00407) ≈ 2.39\n    *   This does not match the given pH of 3.16.\n\nThe calculations confirm that only the values in option A are consistent.\n\n<<<A>>>"
