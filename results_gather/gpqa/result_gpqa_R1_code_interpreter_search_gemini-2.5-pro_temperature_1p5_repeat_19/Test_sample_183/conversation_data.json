    "Here's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule**\n    The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's break down the structure and substituent relationships:\n    *   Parent: Benzene ring.\n    *   Substituents:\n        *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n        *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n    *   This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.\n    *   Relative positions:\n        *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n        *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n        *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n    Let's consider the electronic effects of these groups:\n    *   -OEt (ethoxy): Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu (tert-butyl): Activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's very bulky, which can sterically hinder ortho positions.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n    The synthesis must correctly install these three groups in the 1,2,3 arrangement. The *meta* relationship between the strongly *o,p*-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group is a significant challenge and a key clue. It suggests that a standard electrophilic aromatic substitution on an ethoxy-substituted benzene might not be the final step for nitration.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\n    Let's analyze each option methodically.\n\n    **Option A:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation). OK.\n    ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group directs incoming electrophiles to the *para* position to minimize steric hindrance. The major product is **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. OK.\n    iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. We have two groups: -tBu (*o,p*-director) and -SO3H (*m*-director). Both groups direct the new substituent to the same position: *ortho* to -tBu and *meta* to -SO3H. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    iv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. Product: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    At this stage, we have a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1(-SO3H), 2(-NH2), and 4(-tBu). This is a 1,2,4-substitution pattern. The target molecule is a 1,2,3-substituted benzene. No sequence of further reactions on this intermediate can rearrange the fundamental substitution pattern of the ring to 1,2,3. Therefore, this pathway cannot lead to the desired product.\n    **Conclusion: Option A is incorrect.**\n\n    **Option D:**\n    i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → **Nitrobenzene**. OK.\n    ii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → **Aniline**. OK.\n    iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) is a strong electrophile that reacts irreversibly with the basic lone pair on the aniline's nitrogen atom. This forms a complex (-NH2-AlCl3), which deactivates the ring so strongly that the Friedel-Crafts reaction does not proceed.\n    **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.**\n\n    **Option C:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. OK.\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: tert-Butylbenzene → mixture of o/p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Let's assume we proceed with either isomer.\n    iii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation. This step is plausible.\n    iv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This is the reagent for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) (a nitro-tert-butyl-benzenesulfonic acid) has no amino group. Therefore, this step is impossible.\n    **Conclusion: Option C is incorrect.**\n\n    **Option B:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. OK.\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. This gives a mixture of *o*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is major, but the ortho isomer is formed and can be separated. Let's proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. OK.\n    iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group. o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene → **2-tert-butylaniline**. OK.\n    iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial step. Under strong acidic nitrating conditions, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to an anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n        *   The -NH3+ group is a *meta*-director.\n        *   The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director.\n        Let's look at the positions in 2-tert-butylanilinium: -NH3+ is at C1, -tBu is at C2.\n        *   -NH3+ directs incoming NO2+ to positions C3 and C5.\n        *   -tBu directs incoming NO2+ to positions C3 (*ortho*) and C5 (*para*).\n        Both directing groups steer the nitration to positions 3 and 5. While one might expect the 5-nitro product to be dominant due to less steric hindrance, experimental results show that a significant amount of the **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** is formed (often in a ratio close to 1:1 with the 5-nitro isomer). So, we can obtain the required 1,2,3-substituted intermediate. OK.\n    v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline to form a diazonium salt. OK.\n    vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. This yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. OK.\n    vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenoxide formed with NaOH reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. This gives the final target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. OK.\n    viii) & ix): The final two steps (`SO3/H2SO4` and `dilute H2SO4`) are extraneous and do not fit in the sequence, as the target molecule has already been formed. They appear to be errors in the question's option list.\n\n    However, the core chemical sequence from (i) to (vii) is sound and leads directly to the desired product. Compared to the other options, which contain chemically impossible steps or lead to the wrong isomer, this is the only viable route.\n\n3.  **Final Conclusion**\n    Option B outlines a plausible, multi-step synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Despite the presence of superfluous steps at the end and a key step that gives a mixture of products, it is the only chemically logical pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
