    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Hamiltonian Operator:**\n    The Hamiltonian operator is given by $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$.\n    *   $\\varepsilon$ is a constant with the dimension of energy.\n    *   $\\vec{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is an arbitrary unit vector, which means its magnitude is 1: $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices:\n        $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n2.  **Find the Eigenvalues of H:**\n    The eigenvalues of H, denoted by $\\lambda$, are the values for which the equation $H \\psi = \\lambda \\psi$ has a non-trivial solution for the eigenvector $\\psi$. These are found by solving the characteristic equation: $\\det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$, where I is the identity matrix.\n\n    An elegant way to solve this is to first compute the square of the Hamiltonian, $H^2$.\n    $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$\n\n3.  **Evaluate $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$:**\n    The term $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$ can be expanded as:\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (n_x \\sigma_x + n_y \\sigma_y + n_z \\sigma_z)^2$\n\n    We use the fundamental property of Pauli matrices:\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{a})(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{b}) = (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b})I + i \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot (\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b})$\n    where $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are any two vectors, and $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n    In our case, we set both vectors to be the unit vector $\\vec{n}$, so $\\vec{a} = \\vec{b} = \\vec{n}$.\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}) = (\\vec{n}.\\vec{n})I + i \\vec{\\sigma}.(\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n})$\n\n    Now, we use the properties of the vector $\\vec{n}$:\n    *   The dot product of a vector with itself is the square of its magnitude: $\\vec{n}.\\vec{n} = |\\vec{n}|^2$. Since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$.\n    *   The cross product of a vector with itself is the zero vector: $\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n} = \\vec{0}$.\n\n    Substituting these back into the equation:\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (1)I + i \\vec{\\sigma}.(\\vec{0}) = I + 0 = I$\n    So, the square of the operator $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})$ is simply the identity matrix.\n\n4.  **Relate Eigenvalues of H and $H^2$:**\n    Now substitute this result back into the expression for $H^2$:\n    $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$\n\n    If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$ with eigenvector $\\psi$, then $H\\psi = \\lambda\\psi$.\n    Applying H again:\n    $H(H\\psi) = H(\\lambda\\psi)$\n    $H^2\\psi = \\lambda(H\\psi) = \\lambda(\\lambda\\psi) = \\lambda^2\\psi$\n\n    We also know that $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$, so:\n    $H^2\\psi = (\\varepsilon^2 I)\\psi = \\varepsilon^2 \\psi$\n\n    Comparing the two expressions for $H^2\\psi$, we get:\n    $\\lambda^2\\psi = \\varepsilon^2\\psi$\n    Since $\\psi$ is a non-zero vector, we can conclude:\n    $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvalues:**\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives the possible values for the eigenvalues $\\lambda$:\n    $\\lambda = \\pm \\sqrt{\\varepsilon^2} = \\pm \\varepsilon$\n\n    Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n*Alternative Method: Direct Calculation*\n\n1.  Construct the matrix for H:\n    $H = \\varepsilon(n_x\\sigma_x + n_y\\sigma_y + n_z\\sigma_z) = \\varepsilon \\left( n_x \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + n_y \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + n_z \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $H = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\\\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  Solve the characteristic equation $\\det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n    $\\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon n_z - \\lambda & \\varepsilon(n_x - i n_y) \\\\ \\varepsilon(n_x + i n_y) & -\\varepsilon n_z - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0$\n    $(\\varepsilon n_z - \\lambda)(-\\varepsilon n_z - \\lambda) - \\varepsilon^2(n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) = 0$\n    $\\lambda^2 - (\\varepsilon n_z)^2 - \\varepsilon^2(n_x^2 + n_y^2) = 0$\n    $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2(n_z^2 + n_x^2 + n_y^2) = 0$\n\n3.  Since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$:\n    $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2(1) = 0$\n    $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$\n    $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<B>>>"
