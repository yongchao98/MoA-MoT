    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2. The ratio is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. The Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates away. The standard formula for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `A` is the planet's bond albedo (the fraction of incident radiation reflected back to space).\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Let's write the expression for each planet:\n\n*   T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))\n*   T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n\nNow, let's form the ratio:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a1)) / (R_star / (2 * a2)) )\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-major Axis to Observable Quantities**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the wobble of the star caused by the orbiting planet. The maximum radial velocity of the star, or RV amplitude (denoted by K), for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere:\n*   M_p is the planet's mass.\n*   M_star is the star's mass.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the orbital plane's normal). i=90° is an edge-on orbit.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince both planets were detected by the transit method, their orbital inclinations must be close to 90°, which means sin(i) is very close to 1 for both. We can assume the inclinations are the same, so the sin(i) term will cancel out when we take a ratio.\n\nLet's solve the RV amplitude equation for 'a':\nK^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\nK^2 = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-major Axes (a2 / a1)**\nNow we can find the ratio a2 / a1 using the formula derived above:\n\na2 = (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)\na1 = (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)\n\n(a2 / a1) = [ (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2) ] / [ (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2) ]\n\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out:\n\n(a2 / a1) = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2)\n(a2 / a1) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n**6. Determine the Ratios of Mass and RV Amplitude**\n*   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n    M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **RV Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):**\n    The RV amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ_0), where c and λ_0 are constants.\n    Therefore, the ratio K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ1 / Δλ2.\n    Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n    K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Ratio**\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equations.\n\n*   First, find the ratio a2 / a1:\n    (a2 / a1) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n    (a2 / a1) = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\n    (a2 / a1) = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    (a2 / a1) = 225 / 784\n\n*   Finally, find the temperature ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = 15 / 28\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option C.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given ratios\n# Mass ratio Planet2 / Planet1\nm_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# Doppler shift ratio Planet1 / Planet2\n# This is equivalent to the RV amplitude ratio K1 / K2\nk_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The semi-major axis 'a' is proportional to (M_p / K)^2\n# a2/a1 = (M_p2/K2)^2 / (M_p1/K1)^2 = (M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (m_ratio)**2 * (k_ratio)**2\n\n# The equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a)\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1) = sqrt(a2/a1)\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(f\"{temp_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n*   A is the planet's bond albedo.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 ($T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$).\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It also states that they have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_1}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$). The radial velocity (RV) method provides the information to do this. The RV amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, a is the semi-major axis, G is the gravitational constant, and i is the orbital inclination. Since both planets were detected via the transit method, their orbits are nearly edge-on, so we can assume $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ for both.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for a:\n$K^2 = (\\frac{M_p}{M_{star}})^2 \\frac{G M_{star}}{a}$\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\nNow we can form the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G M_{p2}^2}{M_{star} K_2^2}}{\\frac{G M_{p1}^2}{M_{star} K_1^2}}$\n\nThe constants G and $M_{star}$ cancel out, leaving:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}})^2 \\cdot (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^2$\n\nThe radial velocity K is directly proportional to the observed Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$), so the ratio of velocities $K_1/K_2$ is equal to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\nSo, the ratios are:\n*   $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nSubstitute these values back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^2 \\cdot (\\frac{3}{4})^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, calculate the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
