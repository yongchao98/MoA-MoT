    "Here is the reasoning and the thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the interplanar distance (d-spacing) for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n2.  **Gather the Given Information:**\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n    *   Lattice Parameter (assumed from \"interatomic distance\"), `a` = 10 Angstrom\n    *   Inter-axial angle, `α` = `β` = `γ` = 30°\n    *   Miller Indices, `(hkl)` = (111)\n\n3.  **Find the Correct Formula:** For a rhombohedral crystal system, the formula for the interplanar distance `d_hkl` is:\n    \n    1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]\n    \n    This formula connects the Miller indices (h, k, l), the lattice parameter (a), and the inter-axial angle (α) to the d-spacing.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**\n    *   `a` = 10\n    *   `h` = 1, `k` = 1, `l` = 1\n    *   `α` = 30°\n\n5.  **Calculate the components of the formula:**\n    *   `a²` = 10² = 100\n    *   `h² + k² + l²` = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3\n    *   `hk + kl + lh` = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3\n    *   `α` = 30°\n        *   `sin(30°)` = 0.5\n        *   `cos(30°)` = √3 / 2 ≈ 0.866\n        *   `sin²(30°)` = (0.5)² = 0.25\n        *   `cos²(30°)` = (√3 / 2)² = 3 / 4 = 0.75\n        *   `cos³(30°)` = (√3 / 2)³ = 3√3 / 8 ≈ 0.6495\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerator:**\n    *   Numerator = (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα)\n    *   Numerator = (3)(0.25) + 2(3)(0.75 - 0.866)\n    *   Numerator = 0.75 + 6(-0.116)\n    *   Numerator = 0.75 - 0.696 = 0.054\n\n7.  **Calculate the Denominator:**\n    *   Denominator = a² * (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)\n    *   Denominator = 100 * (1 - 3(0.75) + 2(0.6495))\n    *   Denominator = 100 * (1 - 2.25 + 1.299)\n    *   Denominator = 100 * (0.049) = 4.9\n\n8.  **Calculate 1/d²:**\n    *   1/d² = Numerator / Denominator\n    *   1/d² = 0.054 / 4.9 ≈ 0.01102\n\n9.  **Calculate d:**\n    *   d² = 1 / 0.01102 ≈ 90.74\n    *   d = √90.74 ≈ 9.526 Angstrom\n\n10. **Refine with a Precise Calculation:** Manual calculations with rounded decimals can lead to small errors. A more precise calculation using a script is better to confirm the result. I will use a Python script for this.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_interplanar_distance():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given parameters\n    a = 10.0  # Angstrom\n    h, k, l = 1, 1, 1\n    alpha_deg = 30.0\n\n    # Convert angle from degrees to radians for math functions\n    alpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n    # Calculate required trigonometric values\n    cos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n    sin_alpha = math.sin(alpha_rad)\n\n    cos2_alpha = cos_alpha**2\n    cos3_alpha = cos_alpha**3\n    sin2_alpha = sin_alpha**2\n\n    # Calculate the numerator of the formula\n    # (h^2+k^2+l^2)sin^2(alpha) + 2(hk+kl+lh)(cos^2(alpha) - cos(alpha))\n    numerator = (h**2 + k**2 + l**2) * sin2_alpha + 2 * (h*k + k*l + l*h) * (cos2_alpha - cos_alpha)\n\n    # Calculate the denominator part of the formula\n    # a^2 * (1 - 3cos^2(alpha) + 2cos^3(alpha))\n    denominator = a**2 * (1 - 3*cos2_alpha + 2*cos3_alpha)\n\n    # If the denominator is zero or very close to it, it implies an issue.\n    if abs(denominator) < 1e-9:\n        print(\"Error: Denominator is zero. Cannot calculate.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate 1/d^2\n    inv_d_squared = numerator / denominator\n    \n    # If the result is negative, a valid distance cannot be computed.\n    if inv_d_squared <= 0:\n        print(\"Error: Non-positive result for 1/d^2. Check input values.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the interplanar distance d\n    d = math.sqrt(1 / inv_d_squared)\n\n    print(d)\n\ncalculate_interplanar_distance()\n```",
