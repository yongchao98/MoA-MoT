    "This is an organic chemistry question that involves the benzyne mechanism, a type of nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition pathway.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reagents**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring substituted with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (d) at position 2. Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base. The active species is the amide anion (:NH₂⁻).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Mechanism (Elimination-Addition)**\nThe strong amide base will initiate an elimination reaction to form a highly reactive intermediate called benzyne. This is followed by an addition reaction where the amide anion acts as a nucleophile.\n\n**Step 3: The Elimination Step - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide base abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n*   **Position 6:** has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe base can abstract from either position, leading to two different elimination pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C-6**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the proton (H⁺) from carbon C-6.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C-6 attacks C-1, expelling the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 is not involved in this step and remains in the molecule. We can call this intermediate **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *Note: This pathway is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).*\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuteron from C-2**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from carbon C-2.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C-2 attacks C-1, expelling the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n     \n\nSince both pathways are possible, we will have a mixture of two different benzyne intermediates: **2-deuterobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 4: The Addition Step - Nucleophilic Attack**\nThe amide anion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 2-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The NH₂⁻ nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (or *o*-deuteroaniline).\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-6. A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group position 1, the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline** (or *m*-deuteroaniline).\n    *Thus, the deuterated benzyne intermediate yields two distinct products.*\n\n*   **Products from Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    This is the standard, symmetrical benzyne with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** Gives aniline after protonation.\n    2.  **Attack at C-2:** Also gives aniline after protonation.\n    *Due to symmetry, both attacks on the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate yield only one product: **aniline**.*\n\n**Step 5: Count the Total Number of Possible Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we can identify all the unique organic products formed:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of three possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
