    "This is a classic problem in particle physics that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the framework of special relativity.\n\nHere is the reasoning and the step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Define the process and state the conservation laws:**\n\nThe decay process is given by:\n`Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n\nWe are given that the initial pion (`Pi(+)`) is stationary. This simplifies the problem significantly. Two fundamental principles must be conserved during this decay:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay equals the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay equals the total momentum after the decay.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n\n*   **Before Decay:** Since the `Pi(+)` is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. `p_initial = 0`.\n*   **After Decay:** The products are a muon (`mu(+)`) and a neutrino (`nu`). For the total momentum to remain zero, the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    Let `p_mu` be the momentum of the muon and `p_nu` be the momentum of the neutrino.\n    Then, as vectors, `p_mu + p_nu = 0`.\n    This implies their magnitudes are equal: `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n\nWe will use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, where `E` is total energy, `p` is momentum, `m` is rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light. For convenience, we can use units of MeV for energy and MeV/c for momentum.\n\n*   **Before Decay:** The total energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion.\n    `E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n\n*   **After Decay:** The total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    *   For the muon (`mu+`): `E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)`\n    *   For the neutrino (`nu`): We assume the neutrino is massless (`m_nu = 0`).\n        `E_nu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + 0) = p*c`\n\n    Therefore, the final total energy is:\n    `E_final = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2) + p*c`\n\n*   **Equating Initial and Final Energies:**\n    `m_pi*c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2) + p*c`\n\n**4.

    "The calculation performed previously is correct. I will re-iterate the steps for clarity and confirm the result.\n\n**Problem Analysis:**\n\nWe are analyzing the decay of a stationary positive pion (`Pi(+)`) into a positive muon (`mu(+)`) and a muon neutrino (`nu`).\nDecay Reaction: `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\nGiven Data:\n*   Initial `Pi(+)` is stationary.\n*   Rest Mass Energy of `Pi(+)`, `m_pi*c^2` = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy of `mu(+)`, `m_mu*c^2` = 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (`nu`) is assumed to be massless, so `m_nu*c^2` = 0 MeV.\n\n**Objective:**\nFind the kinetic energies (`KE`) of the product particles, `mu(+)` and `nu`.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nWe apply the laws of conservation of energy and momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum:**\n*   The initial momentum is zero because the pion is stationary.\n*   Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\n*   The initial energy is the rest energy of the pion: `E_initial = m_pi*c^2 = 139.6 MeV`.\n*   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino: `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n*   Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`:\n    *   `E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)`\n    *   `E_nu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + 0) = p*c` (since the neutrino is massless)\n\n*   Equating initial and final energies:\n    `m_pi*c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2) + p*c`\n\n**3. Calculation:**\n\nFirst, we solve the energy conservation equation for the momentum `p*c`. As derived in the previous step, the formula is:\n`p*c = [(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2] / [2 * m_pi*c^2]`\n\nPlugging in the values:\n`p*c = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n`p*c = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n`p*c = [ 8315.67 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n`p*c ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n\nNow we can find the kinetic energies:\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (`KE_nu`):**\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is purely kinetic energy. We found that its total energy `E_nu` is equal to `p*c`.\n    `KE_nu = E_nu = p*c ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n    Rounding to one decimal place gives `29.8 MeV`.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (`KE_mu`):**\n    The total energy released as kinetic energy in the decay (the Q-value) is the difference in rest masses:\n    `Q = m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV`\n    This total kinetic energy is shared between the two products:\n    `Q = KE_mu + KE_nu`\n    `KE_mu = Q - KE_nu`\n    `KE_mu = 33.9 - 29.78`\n    `KE_mu ≈ 4.12 MeV`\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of `mu(+)` ≈ 4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of `nu` ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThese results match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
