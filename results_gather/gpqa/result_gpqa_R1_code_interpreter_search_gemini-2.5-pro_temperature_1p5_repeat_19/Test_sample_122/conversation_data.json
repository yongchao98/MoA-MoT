    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta as measured from the reference frame of the Galaxy.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reference Frames:**\n    *   **Frame S:** The reference frame of the Galaxy (considered stationary in this context).\n    *   **Frame S':** The reference frame of the supernova ejecta (moving relative to the Galaxy).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   **Relative velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta (frame S') relative to the Galaxy (frame S) is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper time (Δt₀):** The time that passes in the ejecta's reference frame (S') is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock that is at rest in the moving frame (the ejecta).\n    *   **Speed of light (c):** `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Plan:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n    *   We are given the time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`), not the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n    *   We must use the time dilation formula to relate the time in the two frames. The formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n    *   To find the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt0 = 50   # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# The distance traveled in the Galaxy frame is d = v * dt,\n# where dt is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame.\n# Time dilation formula: dt = gamma * dt0\n# Lorentz factor: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n# So, d = v * (1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)) * dt0\n\n# Calculation\nbeta_squared = (v / c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\ndt = gamma * dt0\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n>>>\n3061862.1784789725\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is closest to option D, `3,060,000 km`.

    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** We have two reference frames. Frame 1 is the Galaxy, which we consider stationary. Frame 2 is the supernova ejecta, which is moving at a high speed relative to the Galaxy. We are given the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame and its speed relative to the Galaxy. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Concepts:** This problem involves Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Specifically, because the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must account for the phenomenon of **time dilation**.\n\n3.  **Define the Variables:**\n    *   Let the Galaxy be the stationary reference frame (S).\n    *   Let the supernova ejecta be the moving reference frame (S').\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is the proper time, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` traveled in the stationary frame (the Galaxy's frame).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Equations:**\n    *   The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). The relationship between the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt₀`) is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (β = v/c).**\n        `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n        Calculating `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`, we get:\n        `Δt ≈ (1 / 0.9798) * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n        So, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy would measure about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d).**\n        `d = v * Δt`\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n    *   **Alternative combined calculation:**\n        `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = v * (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare the Result with the Options:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer without considering relativistic effects)\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\n    The calculated value `3,061,862 km` is very close to option D, `3,060,000 km`. The slight difference is due to the rounding of the value in the provided option.\n\n<<<D>>>"
