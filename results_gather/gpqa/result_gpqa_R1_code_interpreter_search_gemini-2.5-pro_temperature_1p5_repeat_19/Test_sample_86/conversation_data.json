    "*   **Step 1: Decode the information from the problem statement to deduce the molecular structure.**\n    1.  **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n    2.  **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    3.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group. A carbonyl group has one carbon atom.\n    4.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. A halogen is not a carbon atom.\n    5.  **Putting it all together**: We have a benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and another substituent that contains the remaining two carbons and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable group that fits this is an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This substituent has two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    6.  **The compound's structure**: The compound is a haloacetophenone. The general formula is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃. Since it is di-substituted, it can be the *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer.\n\n*   **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for the deduced structure and compare it with the given options.**\n    *   The structure X-C₆H₄-COCH₃ has two types of protons: those on the aromatic ring and those on the methyl group.\n    *   **Methyl protons (-COCH₃)**: These three protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a single sharp signal, a **singlet (s)**, with an integration of **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is around 2.0 - 2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic protons (-C₆H₄-)**: There are four protons on the ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*).\n        *   An *ortho* or *meta* substitution pattern would result in four distinct aromatic protons, leading to a complex multiplet in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n        *   A *para* (1,4) substitution pattern results in a highly symmetric molecule. There are only two types of aromatic protons, each group having two equivalent protons. This gives a characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)** in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm), with each doublet integrating to **2H**. The two doublets arise from the mutual splitting of the two adjacent, non-equivalent proton sets.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the given ¹H NMR data options.**\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This matches the predicted signal for the methyl group (-COCH₃) perfectly in terms of chemical shift, integration, and multiplicity.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, in the aromatic region is the classic signature of a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield position (7.6-7.8 ppm) is consistent with protons on a ring attached to two electron-withdrawing groups (halogen and acetyl).\n        *   This option is a perfect match for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals at 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region. The integration for the upfield singlet (2H) is incorrect for a methyl group. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. While a molecule like *para*-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO) would fit the carbon count and FTIR data, the multiplicity given is incorrect. The aldehyde proton (-CHO) and the adjacent methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other, resulting in a triplet and a doublet, respectively, not two singlets. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm), which is impossible for the described compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion**: Option A is the only one that correctly represents the ¹H NMR spectrum for a compound fitting all the described characteristics. The compound is a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>"
