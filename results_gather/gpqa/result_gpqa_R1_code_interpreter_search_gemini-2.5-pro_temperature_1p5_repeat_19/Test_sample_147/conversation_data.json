    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (let's denote it as YF_n) and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol), and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\n    We can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (19.00 * n) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * n)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * (19.00 * n) = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19.00 * n - 6.0724 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now we need to find an element Y and an integer n that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (fits Ca, Sc - but their common fluorides don't match other clues).\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (fits Br - but %F for stable bromine fluorides like BrF3 is ~42%, not 32%).\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no good fit).\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (fits Hg, Au, Bi - but chemistry does not align well).\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol) and Americium (Am, 243 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Antimony (Sb) as a Candidate for Y.**\n    Let's assume Y is Antimony (Sb).\n    If n=3, then A2 is **SbF3**. Let's verify the mass percentage of fluorine in SbF3:\n    M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This value (31.88%) is extremely close to the given 31.96%, making Sb a very strong candidate.\n\n3.  **Construct the Narrative with Y = Sb.**\n    *   **A1**: The problem states A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine (F2). This reaction would be `A1 -> SbF3 + F2`. For this to be balanced, A1 must be a higher fluoride of antimony, which is **SbF5**. The reaction would be `SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2`. While this decomposition is chemically unusual (it's a reduction), it provides a consistent identity for A1.\n    *   **Properties of A1 (SbF5)**: The problem says A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" that \"oxidizes xenon\". SbF5 is indeed a powerful oxidizing agent and can oxidize xenon. However, SbF5 is a colorless solid/liquid, not red. This appears to be an inaccuracy in the problem statement. Given how well other facts align, we proceed by noting this discrepancy.\n    *   **A3**: This compound is obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb) and interacts with xenon. The reaction of antimony with excess fluorine produces SbF5 (`Sb + 5/2 F2 -> SbF5`). Since SbF5 interacts with xenon, A3 must be **SbF5**. So, A1 = A3.\n    *   **A4**: We need to find the molecular weight of A4. The remaining major binary fluoride of antimony is SbF3. Let's tentatively assign **A4 = SbF3**.\n    *   **A5**: This compound is formed by adding Y (Sb) to a solution of A4 (SbF3) in a 1:1 molar ratio. The reaction is `Sb + SbF3 -> A5`. A5 would be a sub-fluoride of antimony (e.g., SbF2, though this is not a well-defined stable compound, but could exist in solution). The clue that \"A5 decomposes in water with the formation of two substances\" is consistent with the expected hydrolysis of an unstable sub-fluoride.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on our consistent narrative, we have identified **A4 = SbF3**.\n    Now, let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    MW(A4) = MW(SbF3) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 178.76 g/mol. We need to find the range that contains this value.\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 160-180\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 140-160\n\n    The value 178.76 falls within the range of 160-180.\n\nFinal check: The Plutonium (Y=Pu) hypothesis also provided a good mass-percentage fit (A2=PuF6, %F=31.84%), but led to molecular weights for its fluorides (PuF3: ~301, PuF4: ~320, PuF6: ~358) that did not match any of the provided ranges for A4. This strongly disfavors the Pu hypothesis and reinforces the Sb hypothesis, despite the minor discrepancy in the color of A1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
