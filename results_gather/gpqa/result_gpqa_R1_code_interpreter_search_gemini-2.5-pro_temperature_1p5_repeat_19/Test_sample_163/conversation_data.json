    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2), i.e., M1 / M2.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** The problem involves spectroscopic binary systems. The total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) of such a system can be related to its orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K1, K2) of its stars.\n\n4.  **Derive the Mass Relationship:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states: P² = (4π²a³) / (G * M_total), where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the relative orbit and 'G' is the gravitational constant.\n    *   The semi-major axis 'a' can be expressed in terms of observable quantities. For a circular orbit viewed at an inclination 'i', the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1, K2) are related to the orbital velocities (v1, v2) by K = v * sin(i).\n    *   The orbital velocities are v = 2πr/P, where 'r' is the radius of the star's orbit around the center of mass. So, K = (2πr/P) * sin(i).\n    *   The semi-major axis of the relative orbit is a = a1 + a2. From the previous relation, we can write a1 = (P*K1)/(2π*sin(i)) and a2 = (P*K2)/(2π*sin(i)).\n    *   Therefore, a = a1 + a2 = (P * (K1 + K2)) / (2π * sin(i)).\n    *   Substituting this 'a' back into Kepler's Law and solving for M_total gives:\n        M_total = [P * (K1 + K2)³] / (2πG * sin³(i))\n    *   The problem states that both systems exhibit \"eclipses.\" This implies we are viewing the systems nearly edge-on, so the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1. Therefore, the sin³(i) term becomes 1.\n    *   The simplified relationship is: M_total ∝ P * (K_total)³, where K_total = K1 + K2.\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M1 / M2.\n    *   M1 ∝ P1 * (K1a + K1b)³\n    *   M2 ∝ P2 * (K2a + K2b)³\n    *   The ratio is: M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\n6.  **Calculate the Values:**\n    *   For System 1: P1 = 2 years, K1_total = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s.\n    *   For System 2: P2 = 1 year, K2_total = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s.\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Ratio:**\n    *   M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n    *   M1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³\n    *   M1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n    *   M1 / M2 = 2 * (27/125)\n    *   M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n    *   M1 / M2 = 0.432\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of 0.432 is closest to the option D (~ 0.4).\n\nTo ensure accuracy, a short Python script can perform the calculation.\n```python\n# Parameters for System 1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1a = 10.0  # km/s\nK1b = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Parameters for System 2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2a = 15.0  # km/s\nK2b = 10.0  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system\nK1_total = K1a + K1b\nK2_total = K2a + K2b\n\n# The ratio of the total masses is given by (P1/P2) * (K1_total/K2_total)^3\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```",
