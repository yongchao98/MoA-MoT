    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three double bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2) due to its symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n    *   An amide C=O is typically lower, around 1650-1680 cm-1.\n    *   An ester C=O conjugated with an aromatic ring is typically found around 1715-1730 cm-1.\n    *   This value strongly suggests a conjugated ester.\n\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The triplet means it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2), which is a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Fragment:** A -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The quartet means it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3), which is a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a CH2 group. It is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-COO-**CH2**-).\n    *   **Fragment:** Combining this with the signal at 1.20 ppm confirms the presence of an ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl: -COO-**CH2CH3**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** A broad signal is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in an alcohol (-OH) or an amine (-NH2).\n    *   **Interpretation:** This signal is consistent with the primary amine (-NH2) group identified in the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are 4 protons in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** Two doublets of equal integration indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The aromatic protons are split into two groups. One group is significantly deshielded (shifted downfield to 8.0 ppm), indicating they are close to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the -COOCH2CH3 ester). The other group is less deshielded (7.0 ppm), indicating they are close to an electron-donating group (like the -NH2 amine).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound has:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   The two substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) group.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This has a propionate group. The CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl would appear as a quartet around 2.4 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a 1,3- (meta) substituted ring, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two doublets. It is also an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O frequency.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is fully consistent with all the data:\n    *   Formula C9H11NO2.\n    *   IR: Primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester C=O.\n    *   1H NMR: An ethyl group (triplet and quartet), a primary amine (broad singlet), and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with signals consistent with -NH2 and -COOEt substituents.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
