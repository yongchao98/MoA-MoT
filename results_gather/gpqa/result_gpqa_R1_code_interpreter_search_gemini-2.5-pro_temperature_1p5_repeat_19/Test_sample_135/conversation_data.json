    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Vector Field and the Volume:**\n    *   The vector field is given by its magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and its direction, which is purely radial. In vector notation using spherical coordinates, this is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume of integration `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. The surface enclosing this volume, `S`, is the surface of this sphere.\n\n2.  **State the Goal:**\n    *   The goal is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field `f`, which is written as `∫∫∫_V (∇ . f) dV`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    *   The Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this kind of problem. It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses `V`.\n    *   Mathematically: `∫∫∫_V (∇ . f) dV = ∬_S (f . dS)`\n    *   This theorem is particularly useful because the field `f` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), which would complicate the direct calculation of the volume integral. By converting it to a surface integral on the sphere of radius `R`, we avoid integrating over the singularity itself.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Surface Integral (Flux):**\n    *   The surface integral is `∬_S (f . dS)`.\n    *   On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   The differential surface area element `dS` for a sphere in spherical coordinates points radially outward. Its vector form is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r̂`.\n    *   Now, we compute the dot product `f . dS`:\n        `f . dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] . [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r̂]`\n    *   Since `r̂ . r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies:\n        `f . dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n    *   Now, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n        `∬_S (f . dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   We can separate the integrals:\n        `= [ ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) dφ ] * [ ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ ]`\n    *   Evaluate each integral:\n        *   `∫(from φ=0 to 2π) dφ = [φ]` from 0 to 2π `= 2π - 0 = 2π`\n        *   `∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]` from 0 to π `= -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   Multiply the results:\n        `∬_S (f . dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    *   `∫∫∫_V (∇ . f) dV = 4π`\n\n6.  **Alternative Consideration (Why not zero?):**\n    *   If one were to calculate the divergence `∇ . f` directly for `r > 0`, the result would be zero:\n        `∇ . f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * f_r) = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * (1/r^2)) = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (1) = 0`\n    *   This suggests the integral should be zero. However, this calculation is not valid at `r=0` where the field is infinite. This singularity acts as a point source, and its divergence is not zero but is represented by a Dirac delta function, `∇ . f = 4π * δ³(r)`. The integral of this over a volume containing the origin is `4π`. The Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this singularity by shifting the calculation to the boundary surface.\n\nTherefore, the value of the integral is `4π`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
