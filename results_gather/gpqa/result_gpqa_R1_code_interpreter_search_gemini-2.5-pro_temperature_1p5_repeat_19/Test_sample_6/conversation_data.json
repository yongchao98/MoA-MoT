    "To determine the energy at which high-energy gamma-rays ($\\gamma$) have their lifetimes limited by pair production with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons ($\\gamma_{CMB}$), we need to find the threshold energy for the reaction $\\gamma\\gamma_{CMB}\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. This process limits the distance high-energy gamma-rays can travel through the universe, effectively limiting their \"lifetime\" in flight.\n\n### 1. Relativistic Kinematics\n\nThe reaction is governed by the conservation of four-momentum. Let the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray, the CMB photon, the electron, and the positron be $P_{\\gamma}$, $P_{CMB}$, $P_{e^{-}}$, and $P_{e^{+}}$, respectively.\n\nThe conservation of four-momentum is:\n$P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB} = P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}}$\n\nTo find the threshold energy, we analyze this equation in a Lorentz-invariant way by squaring both sides:\n$(P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB})^2 = (P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}})^2$\n\nThe square of a four-momentum $P=(E, \\vec{p})$ is $P^2 = E^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2c^2 = (mc^2)^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass.\n\n**Left-hand side (LHS):**\nThe rest mass of a photon is zero. Therefore, $P_{\\gamma}^2 = 0$ and $P_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\nThe LHS expands to:\n$P_{\\gamma}^2 + P_{CMB}^2 + 2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = 2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB}$\nThe dot product of the four-momenta is $P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$.\nSince photons travel at the speed of light $c$, the magnitude of their momentum is $|\\vec{p}|=E/c$. In units where $c=1$, $|\\vec{p}|=E$.\nSo, $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}\\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two incoming photons.\nThe LHS becomes:\n$2(E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}\\cos\\theta) = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\n**Right-hand side (RHS):**\nThe term $(P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}})^2$ is the square of the total four-momentum of the final electron-positron pair. This is a Lorentz invariant quantity, meaning it is the same in all inertial reference frames. We can conveniently evaluate it in the center-of-mass (CM) frame.\nAt the threshold energy, the electron and positron are created with the minimum possible energy, which means they are created at rest in the CM frame.\nThe total energy in the CM frame is the sum of the rest mass energies of the electron ($m_e c^2$) and the positron (also $m_e c^2$).\n$E_{CM, threshold} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$\nThe total momentum in the CM frame is zero.\nTherefore, the square of the total four-momentum of the pair is:\n$(P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}})^2 = (E_{CM, threshold})^2 - (\\vec{p}_{total, CM})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 - 0 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n\n**Combining LHS and RHS:**\nEquating the two sides, we get:\n$2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n\n### 2. Calculating the Threshold Energy\n\nTo find the minimum (threshold) energy $E_{\\gamma, th}$ for the high-energy photon, we need to consider the most efficient collision scenario. The equation shows that $E_{\\gamma}$ is minimized when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. This occurs for a head-on collision, where the photons travel in opposite directions ($\\theta = \\pi$, so $\\cos\\theta = -1$).\nIn this case, $(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\nSubstituting this into our equation:\n$2E_{\\gamma, th}E_{CMB}(2) = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n$4E_{\\gamma, th}E_{CMB} = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n### 3. Plugging in the Values\n\nNow we can calculate the numerical value for the threshold energy.\n- The rest mass energy of an electron is $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n- The average energy of a CMB photon is given as $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511^2) \\times (10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} \\text{ eV}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} \\text{ eV}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nTo compare with the given options, we convert this energy to Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{15}}{10^9} \\text{ GeV}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = 0.2611 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV.\n\nWe can confirm this with a short Python script for precision.\n```python\n# Constants\nm_e_c2_MeV = 0.511  # Rest mass energy of an electron in MeV\nE_cmb_eV = 1e-3     # Average energy of a CMB photon in eV\n\n# Convert electron rest mass energy to eV\nm_e_c2_eV = m_e_c2_MeV * 1e6\n\n# Calculate the threshold energy in eV\n# Formula: E_gamma_th * E_cmb = (m_e_c2)^2 (for head-on collision)\nE_gamma_th_eV = (m_e_c2_eV**2) / E_cmb_eV\n\n# Convert the threshold energy to GeV\nE_gamma_th_GeV = E_gamma_th_eV / 1e9\n\nprint(f\"The threshold gamma-ray energy is: {E_gamma_th_GeV:.2e} GeV\")\n```\n>>>\nThe threshold gamma-ray energy is: 2.61e+05 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of $2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires us to find the threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) to undergo pair production when colliding with a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The reaction is $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Conservation of Four-Momentum:** The fundamental principle governing this interaction is the conservation of four-momentum. Let the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray, the CMB photon, the electron, and the positron be $P_{\\gamma}$, $P_{CMB}$, $P_{e^{-}}$, and $P_{e^{+}}$, respectively. The conservation law states:\n    $P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB} = P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}}$\n\n2.  **Lorentz Invariant Form:** To find the threshold energy, we can work with the square of the four-momenta, as it is a Lorentz invariant quantity (the same in all inertial reference frames). We square both sides of the equation:\n    $(P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB})^2 = (P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}})^2$\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Left-Hand Side (LHS):**\n    The square of a single photon's four-momentum is $P^2 = (mc^2)^2$. Since photons are massless, $P_{\\gamma}^2 = 0$ and $P_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\n    The LHS expands to:\n    $P_{\\gamma}^2 + P_{CMB}^2 + 2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = 2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB}$\n    The scalar product of the two four-momenta is $P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. For photons, the magnitude of the momentum is $|\\vec{p}| = E/c$. In units where c=1, $|\\vec{p}| = E$. Thus, $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}\\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the propagation directions of the two photons.\n    So, the LHS becomes:\n    $2(E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}\\cos\\theta) = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Right-Hand Side (RHS) at Threshold:**\n    The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. At this threshold, the electron ($e^−$) and positron ($e^+$) are created with the minimum possible kinetic energy. In the center-of-mass frame of the collision, this means they are created at rest.\n    The total energy in the center-of-mass frame is therefore the sum of the rest mass energies of the electron and positron: $E_{CM} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$.\n    The total momentum in the center-of-mass frame is zero.\n    The square of the total four-momentum of the final pair, $(P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}})^2$, is a Lorentz invariant. We can calculate its value in the center-of-mass frame:\n    $(P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}})^2 = (E_{CM})^2 - (|\\vec{p}_{total, CM}|c)^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 - 0 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n\n5.  **Derive the Threshold Energy Formula:**\n    Equating the LHS and RHS:\n    $2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    To find the minimum (threshold) energy for the high-energy gamma-ray, $E_{\\gamma, th}$, we need to find the condition that makes the reaction most efficient. The equation shows that for a fixed right-hand side, $E_{\\gamma}$ is minimized when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. This occurs for a head-on collision, where the photons travel in opposite directions. In this case, the angle $\\theta = \\pi$ (or 180°), and $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\n    The maximum value of $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n    Substituting this into the equation:\n    $2E_{\\gamma, th}E_{CMB}(2) = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $4E_{\\gamma, th}E_{CMB} = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    Solving for $E_{\\gamma, th}$:\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    We are given the following values:\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\n    Now, we plug these values into our derived formula:\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\n7.  **Convert to GeV:**\n    The options are given in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$).

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\nThe problem asks for the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) that can annihilate with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$). The reaction is $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$. This process, known as pair production, effectively limits the distance that very high-energy gamma-rays can travel through the universe.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Four-Momentum:** The interaction is governed by the conservation of relativistic four-momentum. Let the four-momenta be $P_{\\gamma}$ for the high-energy photon, $P_{CMB}$ for the CMB photon, and $P_{e^{-}}$ and $P_{e^{+}}$ for the resulting electron and positron.\n    $P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB} = P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}}$\n\n2.  **Lorentz Invariant Analysis:** To find the energy threshold, we use the Lorentz-invariant product of four-momenta. Squaring both sides of the conservation equation gives:\n    $(P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB})^2 = (P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}})^2$\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Left-Hand Side (LHS):**\n    The LHS expands as $P_{\\gamma}^2 + P_{CMB}^2 + 2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB}$. For any photon (which is massless), the square of its four-momentum $P^2 = (m c^2)^2$ is zero. Therefore, $P_{\\gamma}^2 = 0$ and $P_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\n    The dot product is $P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. Since $|\\vec{p}|=E/c$ for photons (and we use units where $c=1$), this becomes $E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two photons.\n    The LHS simplifies to $2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Right-Hand Side (RHS) at the Threshold:**\n    The threshold condition represents the minimum energy required to create the electron-positron pair. In the center-of-mass frame of reference, this means the electron and positron are created at rest, with zero kinetic energy.\n    The total energy in the center-of-mass frame is the sum of the rest mass energies of the products: $E_{CM} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$.\n    The square of the total four-momentum of the final pair, $(P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}})^2$, is a Lorentz invariant. We can evaluate it in the center-of-mass frame, where the total momentum is zero:\n    $(P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}})^2 = (E_{CM})^2 - (\\vec{p}_{total, CM})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n5.  **Deriving the Threshold Energy:**\n    Equating the simplified LHS and RHS:\n    $2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    To find the minimum or threshold energy for the incoming gamma-ray ($E_{\\gamma, th}$), we must consider the most efficient collision scenario. The energy $E_{\\gamma}$ is minimized when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. This occurs for a head-on collision, where the photons travel towards each other ($\\theta = \\pi$, so $\\cos\\theta = -1$).\n    For a head-on collision, $(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n    The equation becomes:\n    $2E_{\\gamma, th}E_{CMB}(2) = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $4E_{\\gamma, th}E_{CMB} = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    We are given the necessary values:\n    *   Rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\n7.  **Final Conversion to GeV:**\n    The answer choices are in Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.2611 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV.
