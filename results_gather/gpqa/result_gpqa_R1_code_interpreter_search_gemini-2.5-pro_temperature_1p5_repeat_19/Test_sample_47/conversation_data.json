    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br₂) to add a bromine atom to one of the alpha-carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n*   **Mechanism:** The reaction typically proceeds via an enol or enolate intermediate. In the symmetric cyclohexanone, both alpha positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n    \n     \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-haloketone with protons on the other α'-carbon (C6). When treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH), it undergoes a classic named reaction called the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate.\n    3.  The hydroxide nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone, opening the ring.\n    4.  Protonation of the resulting carboxylate yields a carboxylic acid with a contracted ring.\n*   **Product 2:** The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone rearranges to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *An alternative reaction, E2 elimination, would form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the subsequent reaction in Step 3 strongly indicates that the Favorskii rearrangement is the correct pathway.*\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂). This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Pyridine is added as a non-nucleophilic base to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl), forming cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a bulky and mild reducing agent. Unlike the powerful LiAlH₄, it is selective for reducing acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the corresponding alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** The acyl chloride is reduced to an aldehyde. The final product is cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\n     \n\n**Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms on Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde)**\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde. It consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to rapid ring flipping (pseudorotation), the molecule has a time-averaged plane of symmetry (a Cₛ plane). This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the carbon it's attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Analysis of Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This proton lies on the plane of symmetry and is in a unique chemical environment. (1st distinct type)\n    2.  **C1 proton (methine H):** This proton is also on the plane of symmetry, attached to the ring carbon bonded to the aldehyde group. It is also unique. (2nd distinct type)\n    3.  **C2 and C5 protons:** The plane of symmetry makes the CH₂ group at C2 equivalent to the CH₂ group at C5. However, within the CH₂ group at C2, the two protons are not equivalent. One is *cis* (on the same side) and one is *trans* (on the opposite side) relative to the aldehyde group in the average conformation. They cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation, making them diastereotopic. Therefore, the two \"cis\" protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two \"trans\" protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other, but the cis and trans sets are distinct from each other. This gives us two more types of hydrogens. (3rd and 4th distinct types)\n    4.  **C3 and C4 protons:** The plane of symmetry also makes the CH₂ group at C3 equivalent to the CH₂ group at C4. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on the C3 carbon are diastereotopic due to their different spatial relationships with the substituent at C1. This gives us another two distinct types of hydrogens. (5th and 6th distinct types)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy summing up the distinct types, we have:\n*   1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1 H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
