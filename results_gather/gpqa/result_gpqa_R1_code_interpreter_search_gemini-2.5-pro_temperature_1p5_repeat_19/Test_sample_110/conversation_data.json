    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type Identification:** This reaction involves a ketone, a strong bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK), and an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate). This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation (Enolate Formation):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O at position 1):\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no** α-hydrogens.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-hydrogen.\n    *   Since only the C6 position has an α-hydrogen, the base must deprotonate at C6. This is the only possible enolate that can be formed.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate formed is the nucleophile. Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is the Michael acceptor (the electrophile).\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enolate (C6) will attack the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The electrons then shift, and after a proton quench (workup), the final product is formed. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the original acrylate.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Product A Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The final product has the ethyl acrylate unit added to the C6 position of the cyclohexanone ring. The added group is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   To name this product, we can treat the cyclohexanone part as a substituent on the propanoate chain, as done in the options.\n    *   The name format is `ethyl 3-(substituent)propanoate`. The point of attachment on the substituent is designated as C1 for naming purposes.\n    *   Let's number the cyclohexanone ring according to IUPAC rules for naming a substituent:\n        *   The point of attachment (our original C6) is now **C1**. This carbon has a **methyl** group.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon (our original C1) is adjacent to C1 and becomes **C2**. It is an **oxo** group.\n        *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (our original C2) is adjacent to the oxo group and becomes **C3**. It has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the substituent name: **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name given for A in options A and B.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type Identification:** This reaction involves a nitroalkane (1-nitropropane), a strong base (KOH), and an α,β-unsaturated nitrile ((E)-but-2-enenitrile). This is a **nitro-Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation (Nitronate Formation):**\n    *   The α-hydrogens of a nitroalkane (on the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group) are acidic.\n    *   The base, KOH, will deprotonate the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂) to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`. This is our nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group (`CH₃-CH=`).\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   A subsequent protonation step (from H₂O in the reaction mixture) on the α-carbon of the nitrile part yields the final product.\n    *   The new bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH(R)-CH₂-CN`, where R is the 1-nitropropyl group, `-CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   The combined structure is: `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n4.  **Product B Structure and Naming:**\n    *   Let's find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (-CN).\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n              NO₂\n              |\n         CH₃-CH₂-CH -- CH -- CH₂ -- CN\n                        |\n                        CH₃\n        ```\n    *   Numbering the longest chain starting from the nitrile carbon (C1):\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`\n    *   The parent chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Identify the substituents on this chain:\n        *   A **methyl** group is at position **C3**.\n        *   A **nitro** group is at position **C4**.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given for B in options B and D.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find that **Option B** correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
