    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Fission Products**\n\n*   Initial nucleus: Mass `M`, at rest.\n*   Initial total energy: `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, this is its rest-mass energy.\n*   Fission products: Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Mass relation: The more massive fragment `m1` is twice as massive as `m2`. So, `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   Sum of final rest-masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Masses and Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the fragment masses:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can now find their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission is converted into the kinetic energy of the two fragments. This is the Q-value of the reaction.\n`Q = (Initial rest-mass energy) - (Final sum of rest-mass energies)`\n`Q = (M * c^2) - (m1 * c^2 + m2 * c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T_total = T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial total momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the final total momentum is also zero. This means the two fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta. Let `p` be the magnitude of the momentum for each fragment (`p1 = p2 = p`).\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n*   The ratio of their kinetic energies is: `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`.\n*   We also know `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   From the ratio, we have `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`. Substituting this into the sum:\n    `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\nSo, the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is `T1_classical = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, we use the principles of conservation of total energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: `p1 = p2 = p`, same as the classical case. The relativistic momentum-energy relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. This implies `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\n    Since both fragments have the same momentum magnitude `p`, we can write:\n    `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy**: The total energy of the initial nucleus `M*c^2` is converted into the total energies of the final fragments, `E1 + E2`.\n    `E1 + E2 = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\nNow we solve for `E1`, the total energy of the first fragment. Rearrange the momentum equation:\n`E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (198 GeV)^2 - (99 GeV)^2`\nSubstitute `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`:\n`(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198^2 - 99^2) GeV^2`\n`E1 - E2 = (39204 - 9801) / 300 GeV = 29403 / 300 GeV = 98.01 GeV`\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for `E1` and `E2`:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations together:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T1_relativistic = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n```python\n# Constants and initial values from the problem\nM_c2 = 300.0  # GeV\n\n# Step 1: Calculate rest-mass energies of the fragments\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# m1 = 2 * m2\n# => 3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\n# => 3 * m2c2 = 0.99 * Mc2\nm2_c2 = 0.99 * M_c2 / 3.0\nm1_c2 = 2.0 * m2_c2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Q-value (total kinetic energy)\nQ = M_c2 - (m1_c2 + m2_c2)\n\n# Step 3: Relativistic Calculation of T1\n# E1 + E2 = M*c^2\n# E1 - E2 = ((m1c^2)^2 - (m2c^2)^2) / (M*c^2)\nE1_minus_E2 = (m1_c2**2 - m2_c2**2) / M_c2\nE1_plus_E2 = M_c2\n\n# Solve for E1\n# 2*E1 = E1_plus_E2 + E1_minus_E2\nE1 = (E1_plus_E2 + E1_minus_E2) / 2.0\nT1_relativistic = E1 - m1_c2\n\n# Step 4: Classical Calculation of T1\n# T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2\n# T1_classical + T2_classical = Q\n# T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = Q\n# 3 * T1_classical = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the difference\n# Convert GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic - T1_classical) * 1000\nprint(f\"The difference is: {difference_MeV:.2f} MeV\")\n\n```\n>>>\nThe difference is: 5.00 MeV\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n### **1. Initial State and Problem Definition**\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial total energy is its rest energy, and its initial momentum is zero.\n\n### **2. Properties of the Fragments**\n*   Let the rest-masses of the two fragments be `m1` and `m2`.\n*   The problem states `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **3. Calculating Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nLet's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n    `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`):\n    `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculating Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\nThe energy released during fission is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final total rest energy.\n`Q = T_total = (M * c^2) - (m1 * c^2 + m2 * c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThe total kinetic energy shared by the fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculating T1 (Classical Approximation)**\nAccording to the principle of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest (momentum = 0), the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be `p`.\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2 * m2) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### **6. Calculating T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)**\nWe use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: `p1 = p2 = p`. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. Therefore, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`. Since the momenta are equal:\n    `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy**: The initial energy `M*c^2` is converted into the total energies of the fragments `E1` and `E2`.\n    `E1 + E2 = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`\n\nLet's solve for the total energies `E1` and `E2`.\nFrom the momentum equation:\n`E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (198 GeV)^2 - (99 GeV)^2`\nSubstitute `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`:\n`(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198^2 - 99^2) GeV^2`\n`(E1 - E2) * 300 = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n`E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we solve the system:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\nAdding the two equations:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the fragment's total energy `E1` minus its rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2`\n`T1_relativistic = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n\n### **7. Final Calculation: The Difference**\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<D>>>"
