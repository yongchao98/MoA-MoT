As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of G2.**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` has 0% resistance. This is the most severe phenotype, suggesting G2 plays a critical and essential role in the resistance pathway.\n    *   Consider the double mutant `g1g2`. The `g1` mutant has 75% resistance, and the `g2` mutant has 0% resistance. The double mutant `g1g2` also has 0% resistance. The phenotype of the `g2` mutation completely masks the phenotype of the `g1` mutation.\n    *   Consider the double mutant `g2g3`. The `g3` mutant has 50% resistance, and the `g2` mutant has 0% resistance. The double mutant `g2g3` also has 0% resistance. The phenotype of the `g2` mutation also masks the phenotype of the `g3` mutation.\n    *   This phenomenon, where a mutation in one gene masks the effect of a mutation in another gene, is called **epistasis**. The gene that does the masking (G2 in this case) is called epistatic.\n    *   In a biochemical or genetic pathway, epistasis often indicates that the epistatic gene acts upstream of the other genes. The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. The epistatic behavior of G2 strongly suggests that **G2 is the transcription factor** that regulates the expression of both G1 and G3. If G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can function properly, leading to a complete loss of resistance, regardless of whether G1 or G3 are also mutated.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between G1 and G3.**\n    *   The single mutant `g1` has 75% resistance (a 25% loss from control).\n    *   The single mutant `g3` has 50% resistance (a 50% loss from control).\n    *   If the genes acted in completely separate, additive pathways, we would expect the double mutant `g1g3` to have a resistance of 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%.\n    *   However, the `g1g3` double mutant has a resistance of only 10%. This phenotype is much more severe than would be expected from a simple additive effect and is also more severe than either single mutant.\n    *   This synergistic effect indicates that G1 and G3 have overlapping or cooperative functions. When both are removed, the impact is much greater than the sum of their individual effects. This is a classic example of **gene redundancy**. Both G1 and G3 contribute to the resistance phenotype, likely in parallel, and can partially compensate for each other's absence.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on the analysis.**\n\n    *   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.** This is incorrect. Our analysis shows G2, not G1, is the transcription factor. Pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be determined from this experiment which only measures one trait.\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n        *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": This is consistent with our findings.\n        *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": This is also consistent with our findings (synergistic interaction of the double mutant).\n        *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This is technically incorrect based on the classical definition of epistasis. If G1 were epistatic, the `g1g3` phenotype would be the same as the `g1` phenotype (75% resistance), which it is not (it's 10%). However, the first two parts of this option are strongly supported by the data.\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** This is incorrect. Pleiotropy cannot be determined.\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.** This is incorrect. We cannot determine if they share a promoter from this data. Also, G3 is not epistatic to G1 (the `g1g3` phenotype of 10% is not the same as the `g3` phenotype of 50%).\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Option B contains the two most accurate conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment: G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 exhibit gene redundancy. Despite the likely inaccuracy of the third clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\"), this option is by far the best description of the genetic interactions compared to the other choices, which contain clear and fundamental errors.\n\n<<<B>>>"
