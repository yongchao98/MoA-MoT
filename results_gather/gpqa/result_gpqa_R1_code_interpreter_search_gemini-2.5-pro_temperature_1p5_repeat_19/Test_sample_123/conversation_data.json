    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:**\n    *   **Particle Decay:** Unstable particles decay exponentially. The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` is given by `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ)`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** A moving clock runs slower than a stationary one. If a particle has a proper mean lifetime `τ₀` (its lifetime in its own rest frame), its lifetime `τ` as measured in the lab frame, where it moves with a Lorentz factor `γ`, is dilated: `τ = γ * τ₀`.\n    *   **The Experiment:** Particles are created at the center of a spherical detector and travel outwards. We are interested in the fraction of particles that survive long enough to travel the radius `R` and reach the detector wall.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equations:**\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to travel the distance `R` to the detector wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R/v`, where `v` is the particle's velocity.\n    *   Since the particles are ultra-relativistic (`γ` is large), their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. We can approximate `v ≈ c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n    *   The decay of particles is observed in the lab frame. The number of particles surviving after time `t_lab` is given by:\n        `N = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n    *   Here, `τ_lab` is the dilated lifetime in the lab frame, `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n    *   Substituting `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the decay equation gives the fraction of particles `N/N₀` that reach the detector:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/v) / (γ * τ₀))`\n    *   We can group the constants for a given particle type and detector size: Let `C = R / (v * τ₀)`. This constant combines the detector radius, particle velocity, and its proper lifetime. The equation simplifies to:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-C / γ)`\n\n3.  **Use the Initial Conditions:**\n    *   We are given that when the Lorentz factor is `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of surviving particles is `N/N₀ = 1/3`.\n    *   Plugging these values into our simplified equation:\n        `1/3 = exp(-C / 20)`\n    *   To solve for `C`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -C / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -C / 20`\n        `C = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor:**\n    *   We want to find the new Lorentz factor, let's call it `γ₂`, for which `N/N₀ = 2/3`.\n    *   Using the same equation with the new values:\n        `2/3 = exp(-C / γ₂)`\n    *   Again, take the natural logarithm:\n        `ln(2/3) = -C / γ₂`\n        `ln(2) - ln(3) = -C / γ₂`\n        `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -C / γ₂`\n        `ln(3) - ln(2) = C / γ₂`\n    *   Now we can solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = C / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n    *   Substitute the expression for `C` we found in the previous step:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   We can compute the value of `γ₂` using the known values of `ln(3)` and `ln(2)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ngamma_1 = 20.0\n# We are solving for gamma_2 based on the formula:\n# gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n# This is derived from:\n# ln(3) = C / gamma_1  => C = gamma_1 * ln(3)\n# ln(3/2) = C / gamma_2 => gamma_2 = C / ln(3/2) = C / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\nln_3 = math.log(3)\nln_2 = math.log(2)\n\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln_3 / (ln_3 - ln_2)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n\nThe calculation yields approximately 54.18. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 68\nB) 40\nC) 54\nD) 28\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step derivation for the solution:\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Fundamental Principles**: The problem combines two key concepts from physics:\n    *   **Radioactive Decay**: The number of particles `N(t)` remaining at time `t` from an initial population `N₀` follows an exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle.\n    *   **Time Dilation (Special Relativity)**: The mean lifetime `τ` of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is observed to be longer in the lab frame compared to its lifetime in its own rest frame (proper lifetime `τ₀`). This relationship is given by `τ = γ * τ₀`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Setting up the Equation**:\n    *   Particles are created at the center and travel a distance `R = 30` meters to the detector wall.\n    *   They are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time taken to reach the wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n    *   The fraction of particles that survive this journey is `N/N₀`. Using the decay law with the dilated lifetime:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ)`\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n3.  **Using the Initial Conditions**:\n    *   We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles reach the detector (`N/N₀ = 1/3`).\n    *   Let's substitute these values into our equation. The term `R/(c*τ₀)` is a constant for a given particle type and detector size. Let's call it `K`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / γ₁)`\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   To find `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n4.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor**:\n    *   Now, we need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the wall (`N/N₀ = 2/3`).\n    *   We use the same equation with the new values:\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    *   Again, take the natural logarithm:\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n        `ln(2) - ln(3) = -K / γ₂`\n    *   Solving for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = -K / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n        `γ₂ = K / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   Now, substitute the expression for `K` we found in the previous step:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n    *   As calculated by the Python script, the value is:\n        `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n6.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The calculated Lorentz factor `γ₂ ≈ 54.19` is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
