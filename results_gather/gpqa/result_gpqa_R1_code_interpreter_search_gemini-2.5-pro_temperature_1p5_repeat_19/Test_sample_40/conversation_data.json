    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula, as we are dealing with the speed of light.\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Lab Frame (S):** This is the observer's stationary frame of reference.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference, which is the rest frame of the glass. The glass is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the lab frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the Glass (S' frame) relative to the Lab (S frame):** This is given as `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam relative to the Glass (in S' frame):** In any medium with a refractive index `n`, the speed of light is `c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light as measured by an observer at rest with the glass is `u' = 1/n`. Since the beam and the glass move in the same direction, we take this velocity as positive.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam relative to the Lab (in S frame):** This is the unknown quantity we want to find, let's call it `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities `v` and `u'` in the same direction is:\n    `u = (v + u') / (1 + v*u' / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We have:\n    *   `v` = `v`\n    *   `u'` = `1/n`\n    *   `c` = `1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v*(1/n) / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To clear the fractions within the main fraction, multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (v + 1/n) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n*v + n/n) / (n*1 + n*v/n)`\n    `u = (n*v + 1) / (n + v)`\n\n    Rearranging the numerator for clarity gives:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated speed `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
