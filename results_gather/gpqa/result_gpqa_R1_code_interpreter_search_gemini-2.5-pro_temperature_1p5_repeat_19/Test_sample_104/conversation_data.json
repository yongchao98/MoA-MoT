    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   I need to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl / R_star`) that causes the same brightness dip as a rotating star with spots.\n    *   This means I need to calculate two things:\n        a. The amplitude of brightness variation caused by the starspots.\n        b. The amplitude of brightness variation caused by a transiting exoplanet.\n    *   Then, I'll set these two amplitudes equal to each other and solve for `R_pl / R_star`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starspot Scenario:**\n    *   The star has two states from our point of view: maximum brightness and minimum brightness.\n    *   **Maximum Brightness (`F_max`):** This happens when we see the hemisphere with *no spots*. The flux is determined by the star's effective temperature (`T_eff`) across its entire visible disk. Based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, flux is proportional to `Area * T^4`. So, `F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff^4`, where `A_disk` is the projected area of the star's disk (`π * R_star^2`).\n    *   **Minimum Brightness (`F_min`):** This happens when we see the hemisphere that *is* covered in spots. The problem states this hemisphere has a spot filling factor `f = 0.20`. This means 20% of the visible disk's area appears as cool spots, and the remaining 80% is the normal photosphere.\n    *   The flux from this spotted disk is a sum of the flux from the hot part and the cool part:\n        *   Flux from hot part: `∝ (1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff^4`\n        *   Flux from cool part: `∝ f * A_disk * T_spot^4`\n        *   Total `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff^4 + f * A_disk * T_spot^4`\n    *   **Amplitude of Variation:** The question talks about the \"amplitude signal\". In photometry, this usually refers to the relative drop in brightness, calculated as `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n        *   `Amplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n        *   Let's substitute the proportionalities (the `A_disk` term will cancel out):\n            `F_min / F_max = [(1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4] / T_eff^4`\n            `F_min / F_max = (1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4`\n            `F_min / F_max = 1 - f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n        *   Therefore, the amplitude is:\n            `Amplitude_spot = 1 - (1 - f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]) = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n\n3.  **Analyze the Exoplanet Transit Scenario:**\n    *   When an exoplanet transits a star, it blocks a portion of the star's light.\n    *   Assuming the star has a uniform brightness (ignoring limb darkening, as is common in such problems unless specified), the drop in brightness is simply the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2)`\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n\n4.  **Equate the Amplitudes and Solve:**\n    *   The problem states the signals must have the same amplitude: `Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spot`.\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)^2 = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4] )`\n\n5.  **Plug in the Numbers and Calculate:**\n    *   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n    *   Temperature difference is 1000 K, so `T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K`.\n    *   Spot filling factor `f = 0.20`.\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)^4] )`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)^4] )`\n\n    This calculation can be done precisely with a small script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nT_eff = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_diff = 1000 # Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin\nf = 0.20      # Filling factor of spots on the spotted hemisphere\n\n# Calculate the temperature of the spots\nT_spot = T_eff - T_diff\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the signal due to rotational modulation of spots.\n# The relative flux drop is given by: f * (1 - (T_spot/T_eff)^4)\ntemp_ratio = T_spot / T_eff\nspot_amplitude = f * (1 - temp_ratio**4)\n\n# For a transiting exoplanet, the amplitude (transit depth) is (R_pl/R_star)^2.\n# We set the two amplitudes to be equal to find the required planet-to-star radius ratio.\n# (R_pl/R_star)^2 = spot_amplitude\n# R_pl/R_star = sqrt(spot_amplitude)\nrpl_rstar = math.sqrt(spot_amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated relative radius (R_pl / R_star) is: {rpl_rstar}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nstdout:\nThe calculated relative radius (R_pl / R_star) is: 0.3217918510853509\n</execute_result>\nThe code output is `0.32179...`, which is approximately `0.32`.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to its star (`R_pl / R_star`) that would produce a brightness drop equal in amplitude to the one caused by a star's rotational modulation due to a large spotted region.\n\n2.  **Model the Brightness Variation due to Spots:**\n    *   The star's brightness varies as it rotates, showing a \"clean\" hemisphere and a \"spotted\" hemisphere.\n    *   The maximum flux (`F_max`) is observed when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the flux emitted by a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (`F ∝ A * σ * T⁴`). For our purposes, we can write `F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff⁴`, where `A_disk` is the projected area of the star's disk.\n    *   The minimum flux (`F_min`) is observed when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere has a fraction `f` of its area covered by cooler spots and `(1-f)` of its area at the normal effective temperature.\n        *   Filling factor of spots, `f = 0.20`.\n        *   Star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n        *   The spots are 1000 K cooler, so the spot temperature is `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The flux from the spotted hemisphere is the sum of the flux from the hot photosphere and the cooler spots: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴ + f * A_disk * T_spot⁴`.\n    *   The relative amplitude of this brightness variation is `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n        *   `Amplitude_spots = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n        *   Substituting the expressions for flux (the `A_disk` term will cancel out):\n            `Amplitude_spots = 1 - [((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]`\n        *   `Amplitude_spots = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n        *   `Amplitude_spots = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴`\n        *   `Amplitude_spots = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\n3.  **Model the Brightness Drop due to an Exoplanet Transit:**\n    *   When an exoplanet passes in front of its star (a transit), it blocks a portion of the star's light.\n    *   The amplitude of this signal (the transit depth) is the ratio of the planet's projected area (`A_pl = π * R_pl²`) to the star's projected area (`A_star = π * R_star²`).\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = A_pl / A_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n4.  **Equate the Amplitudes and Solve for `R_pl / R_star`:**\n    *   The problem requires the two signals to have the same amplitude: `Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots`.\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴])`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   Plug in the given numbers:\n        *   `f = 0.20`\n        *   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n        *   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴])`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴])`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.20 * [1 - 0.48225...])`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.20 * 0.51775...)`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355...)`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated value `~0.32` matches option D.\n\n### Final Answer\n<<<D>>>"
