    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space.\n\n1.  **Understand the Density Matrix and the Bloch Sphere Representation:**\n    Any single-qubit density matrix, $\\rho$, can be represented as a point within or on the surface of a three-dimensional unit sphere called the Bloch sphere. This geometrical representation is defined by the Bloch vector, $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$. The relationship between the density matrix and the Bloch vector is given by the formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    where:\n    *   $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n    *   $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$.\n    The geometrical position in the qubit space is the vector $\\vec{r}$.\n\n2.  **Express the Given Density Matrix in Matrix Form:**\n    The problem gives the density matrix as:\n    $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n    We know the standard computational basis states are:\n    $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    From these, we can construct the outer products:\n    $|0\\rangle \\langle 0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $|1\\rangle \\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Adding them together gives the identity matrix:\n    $|0\\rangle \\langle 0| + |1\\rangle \\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$\n    Therefore, the given density matrix simplifies to:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} I$\n\n3.  **Determine the Bloch Vector $\\vec{r}$:**\n    We can now find the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ by comparing our simplified density matrix with the general formula.\n    We have $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$.\n    The general formula is $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$.\n    By comparing the two expressions, we can see that:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n    $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$\n    This equation, $r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, is only satisfied if $r_x = r_y = r_z = 0$.\n    Therefore, the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Alternative Method: Calculating Components of $\\vec{r}$ Directly**\n    The components of the Bloch vector can also be calculated using the formula $r_i = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_i)$, where $\\text{Tr}$ is the trace of the matrix.\n    *   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n    *   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n    *   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(1-1) = 0$\n    Both methods yield the same result: $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The geometrical position of the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$ in the qubit space is the origin of the Bloch sphere, represented by the vector r=(0,0,0). This corresponds to a maximally mixed state.\n\nComparing our result with the options provided:\nA) r=(1,1,1)\nB) r=(1,1,0)\nC) r=(0,0,1)\nD) r=(0,0,0)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
