    "**1. Deconstruct the Provided Information**\n\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, consistent with this data.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** For a signal to have this splitting pattern, the corresponding proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   Doublet (d) implies coupling to one neighboring proton (a CH group).\n        *   Triplet (t) implies coupling to two neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n        *   Quartet (q) implies coupling to three neighboring protons (a CH₃ group).\n        *   Therefore, the proton responsible for the `dtq` signal must be adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group.\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** For a signal to have this splitting pattern, the corresponding proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   Doublet (d) implies coupling to one neighboring proton (a CH group).\n        *   Triplet (t) implies coupling to two neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n        *   Another Triplet (t) implies coupling to another, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (a second, different CH₂ group).\n        *   Therefore, the proton responsible for the `dtt` signal must be adjacent to a CH group and two non-equivalent CH₂ groups.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nFirst, let's interpret the condensed formulas into structural drawings and systematic (IUPAC) names.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH** is **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    ```\n          CH₃ CH₃\n          |   |\n    CH₃ - CH--CH--CH₂--COOH\n     5    4   3    2    1\n    ```\n    Let's check for the required signals:\n    *   **H at C3**: Is coupled to H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) would indeed produce a **dtq**.\n    *   **dtt?**: Is there any proton coupled to one CH and two different CH₂ groups? No. Therefore, structure C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH** is **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    ```\n          CH₃ CH₃\n          |   |\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH--CH--COOH\n     5   4   3   2   1\n    ```\n    Let's check for the required signals:\n    *   **H at C3**: Is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This combination (1H, 2H, 3H) would produce a **dtq**.\n    *   **dtt?**: Is there any proton coupled to one CH and two different CH₂ groups? No. Therefore, structure D is incorrect.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH** is **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    ```\n          Et  Et\n          |   |\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH--CH--COOH\n     5   4   3   2   1\n    ```\n    Let's check for the required signals:\n    *   **H at C3**: Is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H). Since the molecule is chiral, these two CH₂ groups are non-equivalent. This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) would produce a **dtt**.\n    *   **dtq?**: Is there any proton coupled to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group? No. All methine (CH) and methylene (CH₂) protons lack a necessary neighbor type to form a `dtq`. For example, the protons on the CH₂ group at C4 are coupled to H at C3 (1H), the terminal CH₃ group (3H), and the geminal proton on C4. This gives a complex multiplet, but not a `dtq`. Therefore, structure A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH** can be interpreted as **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**. Let's draw it and analyze.\n    ```\n                 CH₃(on C4)\n                 |\n    CH₃-CH₂ -- CH -- CH -- CH₂ -- COOH\n     6   5      4      3      2      1\n                       |\n                       CH₂CH₃(on C3)\n    ```\n    Let's check this structure for the required signals:\n    *   **H at C4**: This proton is coupled to H at C3 (1H), the CH₂ at C5 (2H), and the CH₃ on C4 (3H). This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) will produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n    *   **H at C3**: This proton is coupled to H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H). Due to the chiral centers (C3 and C4), these two CH₂ groups are non-equivalent. This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStructure B is the only candidate that has protons in the correct electronic environments to produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
