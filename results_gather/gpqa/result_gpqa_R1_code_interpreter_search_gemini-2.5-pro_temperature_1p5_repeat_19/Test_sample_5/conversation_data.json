    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the energy spectrum for the given potential.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation, it's often beneficial to convert the potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The relationship between polar and Cartesian coordinates is:\n    x = r cos(θ)\n    y = r sin(θ)\n    r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n2.  **Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n    We can substitute the Cartesian relations into the potential expression.\n    The first term is:\n    1/2 kr^2 = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2)\n\n    The second term involves `r cos(θ)`, which is simply `x`:\n    3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ) = 3/2 k (r cos(θ))^2 = 3/2 kx^2\n\n    Now, combine the terms to get the full potential in Cartesian coordinates:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n3.  **Identify the System**\n    The resulting potential V(x, y) is the sum of two independent quadratic potentials, one in x and one in y:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where V_x(x) = 2kx^2 and V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2.\n    This is the potential for a 2D anisotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n4.  **Solve the Schrödinger Equation**\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is:\n    [-ħ²/2m (∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y²) + V_x(x) + V_y(y)] ψ(x, y) = E ψ(x, y)\n\n    Because the potential is separable, the wavefunction can be written as a product of 1D wavefunctions, ψ(x, y) = ψ_x(x)ψ_y(y), and the total energy is the sum of the energies for each dimension, E = E_x + E_y. The equation separates into two 1D Schrödinger equations:\n\n    For the x-direction:\n    [-ħ²/2m d²/dx² + 2kx²] ψ_x(x) = E_x ψ_x(x)\n\n    For the y-direction:\n    [-ħ²/2m d²/dy² + 1/2 ky²] ψ_y(y) = E_y ψ_y(y)\n\n5.  **Find the Energy Eigenvalues**\n    Both of these are standard 1D quantum harmonic oscillator equations. The energy eigenvalues for a 1D QHO with a potential U(z) = 1/2 mω²z² are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω. We need to find the angular frequencies ω_x and ω_y for our system.\n\n    **For the x-direction:**\n    The potential is V_x(x) = 2kx². We match this to the standard form 1/2 mω_x²x²:\n    1/2 mω_x² = 2k\n    mω_x² = 4k\n    ω_x = √(4k/m) = 2√(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\n    E_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2√(k/m)\n\n    **For the y-direction:**\n    The potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky². We match this to the standard form 1/2 mω_y²y²:\n    1/2 mω_y² = 1/2 k\n    mω_y² = k\n    ω_y = √(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n    E_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n    The total energy E is the sum of E_nx and E_ny:\n    E = E_nx + E_ny\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2√(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\n    Now, factor out the common term ħ√(k/m):\n    E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ħ√(k/m)\n    E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] ħ√(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ√(k/m)\n\n    This result gives the energy spectrum for the particle, where n_x = 0, 1, 2, ... and n_y = 0, 1, 2, ... are the quantum numbers.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options**\n    The derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). This matches option C.\n\n    A) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    D) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
