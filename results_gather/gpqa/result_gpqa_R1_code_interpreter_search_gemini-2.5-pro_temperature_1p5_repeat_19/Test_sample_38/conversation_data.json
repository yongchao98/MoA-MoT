    "This is a problem of quantum mechanics that requires the normalization of a wave function.\nThe normalization condition states that the total probability of finding the particle in the allowed region of space must be equal to 1.\nThe probability density is given by the square of the modulus of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|².\n\n1.  **The given wave function is:**\n    Ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\n2.  **The particle is confined to the region 1 ≤ x ≤ 3.**\n    This means the probability of finding the particle outside this region is zero, and we must integrate over this interval.\n\n3.  **The normalization condition is:**\n    ∫ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n    The integral is taken over the allowed region, from x=1 to x=3.\n\n4.  **First, we need to calculate |Ψ(x)|².**\n    |Ψ(x)|² is calculated by multiplying the wave function Ψ(x) by its complex conjugate Ψ*(x).\n    The complex conjugate is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part.\n    Ψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\n    Now, we multiply Ψ(x) and Ψ*(x):\n    |Ψ(x)|² = Ψ*(x) * Ψ(x)\n    |Ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\n\n    This is of the form (c + id)(c - id) = c² + d², where:\n    c = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n    d = 0.5\n\n    So, |Ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² + (0.5)²\n    |Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n5.  **Now, we set up and solve the normalization integral:**\n    ∫ [from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\n    We can split the integral into two parts:\n    ∫ [from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx + ∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\n    *   **Part 1:** ∫ ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx\n        = a² * ∫ ( 1 / (1 + x) ) dx\n        The antiderivative of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).\n        = a² * [ln(1 + x)] evaluated from 1 to 3\n        = a² * [ ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1) ]\n        = a² * [ ln(4) - ln(2) ]\n        Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n        = a² * ln(4/2)\n        = a² * ln(2)\n\n    *   **Part 2:** ∫ 0.25 dx\n        = [0.25 * x] evaluated from 1 to 3\n        = 0.25 * (3 - 1)\n        = 0.25 * 2\n        = 0.5\n\n6.  **Combine the results and solve for 'a':**\n    (a² * ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n    a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\n    Now we calculate the numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Solve for a^2 = 0.5 / ln(2)\na_squared = 0.5 / math.log(2)\n\n# Solve for a\na = math.sqrt(a_squared)\n\nprint(a)\n```\n\nThe calculation yields a ≈ 0.8493.\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    A) 0.35\n    B) 0.85\n    C) 1.1\n    D) 0.6\n\nThe calculated value of `a` is approximately 0.85.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we must apply the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. The normalization condition states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space where it can exist must be equal to 1.\n\nThe probability density of finding the particle at a position x is given by the square of the modulus of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|².\n\n1.  **Given Wave Function:**\n    The wave function is given as Ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Probability Density |Ψ(x)|²:**\n    To find the modulus squared, we multiply the wave function Ψ(x) by its complex conjugate Ψ*(x). The complex conjugate is found by reversing the sign of the imaginary part.\n    Ψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\n    |Ψ(x)|² = Ψ*(x) * Ψ(x)\n    |Ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\n\n    Using the algebraic identity (c + d*i)(c - d*i) = c² + d², where c = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) and d = 0.5, we get:\n    |Ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² + (0.5)²\n    |Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n3.  **Apply the Normalization Condition:**\n    The problem states that particles were only found between x=1 and x=3.
