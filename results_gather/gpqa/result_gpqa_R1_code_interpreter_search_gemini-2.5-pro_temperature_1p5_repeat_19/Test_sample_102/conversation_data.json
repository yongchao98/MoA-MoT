    "This problem asks for the most efficient, high-yield synthetic route to 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting from benzene. Let's analyze the target molecule and work through the options.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n*   **Parent structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   **Substituents on the ring:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a **meta** relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution).\n\n### **2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nWe need to add three groups to the benzene ring. The order of addition is critical because existing substituents direct incoming groups to specific positions.\n\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Introduced by Friedel-Crafts acylation. It's a **meta-director** and a moderate **deactivator**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Introduced by bromination. It's an **ortho-, para-director** and a weak **deactivator**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Introduced by nitration. It's a **meta-director** and a strong **deactivator**.\n\nA crucial rule in synthesis is that **Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation) fail on strongly deactivated rings**, such as those bearing a -NO2 group. This means the acetyl group must be added before the nitro group, or the nitro group must be temporarily converted to a non-deactivating group.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride.\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 → Benzene. This is a deamination reaction that removes the functional group, returning to the starting material. This sequence is illogical for building a complex molecule.\n\n**B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an ortho-, para-director.\n*   ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → A mixture of 4-nitrobromobenzene (major) and 2-nitrobromobenzene (minor).\n*   iii) 4-Nitrobromobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → **No reaction.** The ring is strongly deactivated by both the -NO2 and -Br groups, preventing Friedel-Crafts acylation. This route is not viable.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline. The -NH2 group is a strong activator and o,p-director.\n*   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → This reaction is problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a complex (-NH2+-AlCl3) which is a strong *meta-director*. Friedel-Crafts acylation would then occur at the meta position, but yields are typically very low. Assuming it works to give 3-aminoacetophenone. The next step is bromination. In 3-aminoacetophenone, the powerful o,p-directing -NH2 group would direct bromination to positions 2, 4, and 6, not the required position 5 (relative to the acetyl group). This route will not produce the desired isomer in high yield.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The resulting acetyl group (-COCH3) is a meta-director. This is a good first step.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This step successfully creates the 1,3-substitution pattern.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** Now we nitrate a ring with two substituents: -COCH3 (meta-director) at C1 and -Br (o,p-director) at C3.\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to the other meta position, C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to its ortho (C2, C4) and para (C6) positions.\n    *   This presents a conflict. However, the acetyl group is a stronger deactivator than bromine. It strongly deactivates its ortho and para positions (C2, C4, C6), which happen to be the same positions the bromine directs to. The least deactivated position on the ring is C5, which is meta to both groups. Therefore, the nitronium ion (NO2+) will preferentially attack at C5. This reaction gives the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence D provide a logical and high-yield pathway to the target molecule. The remaining steps (iv-vii) are extraneous and would modify the desired product, but the question asks for a sequence that would *lead to* the synthesis. This three-step sequence is the standard and most effective method.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence of reactions that correctly and efficiently synthesizes 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one is:\n1.  Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene to form acetophenone.\n2.  Bromination of acetophenone to form 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone to form the final product.\n\nThis corresponds to the first three steps of option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
