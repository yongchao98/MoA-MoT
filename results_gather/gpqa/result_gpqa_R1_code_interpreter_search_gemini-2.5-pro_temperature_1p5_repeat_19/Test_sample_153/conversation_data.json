    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The base peak is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopologue of the molecule.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 units heavier than the molecular ion. Its intensity is 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%).\n*   **Interpretation:** The presence of an M+ and M+2 peak with a relative intensity ratio of approximately 100:32 (or ~3:1) is a definitive characteristic of a compound containing one chlorine atom. This is due to the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes: ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This very broad absorption is a classic textbook signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extensive broadening is caused by hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When considered with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an acidic proton, specifically the proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The signal is a singlet because this proton does not typically couple with other protons and undergoes rapid chemical exchange. The integration of 1H confirms the presence of one such proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Symmetry:** The pattern consists of only two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons (2H). This indicates a high degree of symmetry. A disubstituted benzene ring with this pattern must be a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** isomer. In a para-substituted ring, the two protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are also equivalent.\n    *   **Splitting:** Both signals are doublets, which means each set of protons is adjacent to only one neighboring proton. This is consistent with a para-substitution pattern.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** The downfield signal at 8.02 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The signal at 7.72 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the chlorine atom.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group attached to a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring, which also has a chlorine atom attached.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data:**\n\n1.  **MS** tells us MW=156 and there's one Cl atom.\n2.  **IR** tells us there is a carboxylic acid group.\n3.  **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and shows a *para*-substituted aromatic ring.\n\nPutting these pieces together, we have a benzoic acid molecule with a chlorine atom in the *para* (position 4) position. This compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**Let's check this against the options:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. Would have a complex ¹H NMR spectrum with four different aromatic signals.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: MW of 156.5 g/mol, contains a chlorine atom, is a carboxylic acid, and has the *para*-substitution pattern seen in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the ¹H NMR signal at 11 ppm and the characteristic broad O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid in the IR.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is an acid formate, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the acidic proton and the broad O-H IR band.\n\n<<<B>>>"
