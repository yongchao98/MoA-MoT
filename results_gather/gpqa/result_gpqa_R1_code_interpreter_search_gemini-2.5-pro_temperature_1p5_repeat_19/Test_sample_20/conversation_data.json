    "**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where a molecule can exist in two or more interconvertible forms, differing in the position of a proton and a double bond. A common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must possess an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). The α-hydrogen is acidic and can be removed to form an enolate, which is then protonated to form the enol.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the α-carbons.\n    *   Each of these α-carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms (-CH₂- group).\n    *   Because it has α-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it readily tautomerizes to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic compound and thus highly stable.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl carbons (the α-carbons) are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n    *   These α-carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since there are no α-hydrogens, p-benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   Therefore, benzoquinone *does not* show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism. It occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the carbon bearing the -OH group).\n    *   This carbon is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. Chiral molecules exhibit optical isomerism (existing as a pair of enantiomers).\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate *will* show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl Fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester.\n    *   The molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond, which prevents free rotation, leading to geometric isomerism (cis/trans), but this is not optical isomerism.\n    *   To check for optical isomerism, we must check for chirality.\n    *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion (a point in the center of the C=C bond through which you can invert all atoms and get an identical molecule). It is also planar.\n    *   Molecules with a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and *will not* show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nCombining the conclusions:\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
