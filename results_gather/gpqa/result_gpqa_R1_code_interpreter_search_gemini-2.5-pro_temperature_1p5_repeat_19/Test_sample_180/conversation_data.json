    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **Scenario:** We are observing neutrinos on Earth. A specific reaction in the Sun, the pp-III branch, stopped producing neutrinos about 8.5 minutes ago.\n*   **Timing:** Neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light. The travel time from the Sun to Earth is about 8 minutes and 20 seconds. Therefore, the consequences of the pp-III branch stopping are just now observable on Earth.\n*   **Effect:** The pp-III branch is the source of high-energy Boron-8 (⁸B) neutrinos. Stopping this branch means the flux of ⁸B neutrinos drops to zero. All other neutrino-producing reactions (pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycle) are unaffected.\n*   **Question:** We need to find the approximate ratio of the neutrino flux in two energy bands:\n    *   Band 1: 700 keV to 800 keV\n    *   Band 2: 800 keV to 900 keV\n    *   Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)\n\n### **2. Identify Neutrino Sources in Each Band (After the Change)**\n\nWe need to determine which reactions contribute to the neutrino flux in each energy band, given that ⁸B neutrinos are absent.\n\n*   **pp-I neutrinos:** Have a continuous spectrum up to 420 keV. They do not contribute to either band.\n*   **pep neutrinos:** Are a monoenergetic line at 1.44 MeV (1440 keV). They do not contribute to either band.\n*   **⁸B neutrinos (pp-III):** Are now absent.\n*   **⁷Be neutrinos (pp-II):** Consist of a major monoenergetic line at **861 keV** and a minor one at 384 keV. The 861 keV line falls directly into **Band 2**.\n*   **CNO cycle neutrinos (¹³N, ¹⁵O):** Have continuous spectra extending up to ~1.2 MeV and ~1.7 MeV, respectively. They contribute a continuous background flux to **both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n\nBased on this, let's analyze the flux composition in each band after the pp-III branch stops:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   The only source is the continuous spectrum from CNO cycle neutrinos.\n    *   Flux(Band 1) = Flux from CNO in this band.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   The dominant source is the very strong ⁷Be monoenergetic line at 861 keV.\n    *   There is also a small background contribution from CNO cycle neutrinos.\n    *   Flux(Band 2) = Flux(⁷Be line) + Flux(CNO in this band).\n\n### **3. Estimate the Flux Magnitudes**\n\nTo find the ratio, we need the approximate values for these fluxes as measured on Earth. We can use standard values from the Standard Solar Model (SSM), which are well-confirmed by experiments.\n\n*   **Flux of the ⁷Be line (at 861 keV):** This is a large, well-measured flux.\n    *   `F_₇Be ≈ 5.0 x 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm² * s)`\n\n*   **Flux from the CNO continuum:** This is a continuous spectrum, so we need the *differential flux* `φ(E)` (in units of neutrinos / (cm² * s * MeV)). The flux in a small energy band `ΔE` is approximately `φ(E) * ΔE`.\n    *   The total flux from the main CNO reactions (¹³N and ¹⁵O) is `F_CNO ≈ 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos / (cm² * s)`.\n    *   This total flux is spread over an energy range of roughly 1.7 MeV. To get a rough estimate of the average differential flux, we can divide the total flux by an effective width, say ~1 MeV.\n    *   `φ_CNO ≈ F_CNO / (1 MeV) ≈ 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos / (cm² * s * MeV)`\n    *   This approximation for the differential flux is reasonable for the energy range we are considering.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Flux in Each Band**\n\n*   **Flux(Band 1):**\n    *   This is the CNO flux in the 700-800 keV window. The width of this window is `ΔE = 800 - 700 = 100 keV = 0.1 MeV`.\n    *   `Flux(Band 1) ≈ φ_CNO * ΔE ≈ (5 x 10⁸) * 0.1 = 5 x 10⁷ neutrinos / (cm² * s)`\n\n*   **Flux(Band 2):**\n    *   This is the sum of the ⁷Be line flux and the CNO background flux.\n    *   `Flux(CNO in Band 2) ≈ φ_CNO * ΔE ≈ (5 x 10⁸) * 0.1 = 5 x 10⁷`\n    *   `Flux(Band 2) = F_₇Be + Flux(CNO in Band 2) ≈ (5 x 10⁹) + (5 x 10⁷)`\n    *   `Flux(Band 2) ≈ 5.05 x 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm² * s)`\n    *   As you can see, the CNO contribution is only about 1% of the ⁷Be flux. For an \"approximate\" ratio, we can safely ignore the CNO background in Band 2.\n    *   `Flux(Band 2) ≈ F_₇Be ≈ 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm² * s)`\n\n### **5. Compute the Final Ratio**\n\nNow we can compute the ratio:\n\nRatio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)\nRatio ≈ (5 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹)\nRatio ≈ 10⁷⁻⁹\nRatio ≈ 10⁻² = 0.01\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
