    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons (Integration)**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integration values from the 1H NMR data to find the total number of protons in the molecule.\n*   Integration = 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's determine the total number of protons for the possible compounds. All options are acetates, which have a -OCOCH3 group containing 3 protons.\n*   **Propenyl acetate:** A propenyl group is C3H5. So, propenyl acetate (C3H5OCOCH3) has 5 + 3 = **8 protons**. This matches our data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate:** A butenyl group is C4H7. So, butenyl acetate (C4H7OCOCH3) has 7 + 3 = **10 protons**. This does not match our data.\n\nThis initial analysis immediately rules out the butenyl acetate options. The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**Eliminated Options:**\n*   B) Trans-butenyl acetate\n*   D) Cis-butenyl acetate\n\n**2. Analyze the Coupling Constant (J-value)**\n\nWe are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to distinguishing between them is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons (the protons on the C=C double bond).\n\n*   The provided data shows a signal at **7.0 ppm** which is a doublet (d) with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The magnitude of the coupling constant between vinylic protons is dependent on their stereochemistry:\n    *   **Trans** coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) results in a large J-value, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis** coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) results in a smaller J-value, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely within the range for a **trans** double bond. This allows us to conclude that the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**Eliminated Option:**\n*   C) Cis-propenyl acetate\n\n**3. Confirm the Structure by Assigning All Signals**\n\nThe only remaining option is **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Let's verify that all the signals in the spectrum match this structure.\n\n**Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n\n      H(c)   H(b)\n       \\    /\n        C==C\n       /    \\\n    H3C(d)    O-C(=O)-CH3(a)\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This corresponds to the three protons of the acetate methyl group **(a)**. They are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons, so they appear as a singlet. This is a characteristic chemical shift for an acetate group. This is a perfect match.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This corresponds to the vinylic proton **(b)**, which is attached to the same carbon as the oxygen atom. The electronegative oxygen deshields this proton, shifting it far downfield. It is coupled only to proton **(c)** in a *trans* configuration, resulting in a doublet with a large J-value. This is a perfect match.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This corresponds to the other vinylic proton **(c)**. It is coupled to proton **(b)** (which splits it into a doublet) and also to the three protons of the methyl group **(d)** (which splits it into a quartet). The resulting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This is a perfect match.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This corresponds to the three protons of the methyl group **(d)**, which is attached to the double bond. These protons are coupled to the single vinylic proton **(c)**, splitting their signal into a doublet. This is a perfect match.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of the 1H NMR data (chemical shifts, integrations, and splitting patterns including the crucial coupling constant) are fully consistent with the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
