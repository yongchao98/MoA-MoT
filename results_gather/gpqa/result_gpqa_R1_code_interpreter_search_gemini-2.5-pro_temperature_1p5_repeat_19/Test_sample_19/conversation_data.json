    "This question asks to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of this approximation and analyze each statement.\n\n### The Impulse Approximation\n\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is to simplify a complex many-body problem (a projectile interacting with a nucleus of A nucleons) into a much simpler two-body problem (the projectile interacting with a single, free nucleon). The name \"impulse\" comes from the assumption that the interaction is very fast—like a sudden impulse—so fast that the forces binding the nucleon to the rest of the nucleus don't have time to act during the interaction.\n\n### Analysis of the Assumptions\n\nLet's evaluate each of the four statements in the context of this approximation.\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is the foundational assumption. Instead of considering the interaction with the nucleus as a whole or with complex multi-nucleon currents (like meson-exchange currents), we simplify the problem by assuming the interaction happens with just one nucleon at a time. The total interaction is then the incoherent sum of these individual interactions. This is a crucial step in reducing the many-body problem. This statement is **correct**.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This assumption deals with what happens before and after the main interaction. It states that the incoming projectile and the outgoing particles (the scattered projectile and the struck nucleon) do not interact with the other (A-1) \"spectator\" nucleons. This means we ignore effects like absorption or re-scattering of the particles as they travel through the nuclear medium. This is a key feature of the simplest version of the impulse approximation, known as the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA). It ensures that the only interaction we model is the primary one, making the analogy to a free nucleon collision more direct. This statement is **correct**.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself (i.e., its composition from quarks). The impulse approximation is a framework for describing the nucleon's behavior *within the nucleus*. It treats the nucleon as the fundamental particle of the interaction. The details of the nucleon's internal quark structure, whether relativistic or not, are a separate physical consideration. One can use the impulse approximation with either relativistic or non-relativistic models for the nucleon form factors. Therefore, this assumption is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation itself. This statement is **incorrect** as a required assumption.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the essence of the \"impulse\" concept. The interaction is assumed to be so rapid that the potential binding the nucleon to the nucleus can be neglected *during* the collision. In effect, the nucleon is treated as a free particle at the moment of interaction (though it still possesses the momentum it had from its motion within the nucleus, i.e., Fermi motion). This is what allows us to use the properties of a free nucleon in the calculation. This statement is **correct**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe impulse approximation is jointly defined by the following assumptions: the interaction targets a single nucleon (1), that nucleon is treated as free from its binding potential during the interaction (4), and the surrounding nuclear medium is considered transparent to the incoming and outgoing particles (2). Therefore, assumptions 1, 2, and 4 together imply the impulse approximation.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
