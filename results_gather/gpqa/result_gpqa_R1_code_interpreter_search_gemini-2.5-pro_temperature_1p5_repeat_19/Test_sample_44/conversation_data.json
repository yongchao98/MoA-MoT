    "This problem requires us to determine the energy states of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Concepts\n\n*   **Particles**: The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: Identical fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by a set of quantum numbers. In this case, the quantum numbers are the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n*   **Energy Levels of a 1D Infinite Well**: The energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$ , where $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$\n*   **Energy Unit**: The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **State Occupancy**: Due to the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two electrons.\n\n### 2. Calculation of Energy States\n\nWe will now determine the total energy of the 4-particle system for the ground state and the first two excited states by filling the energy levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n#### Ground State Energy ($E_g$)\n\nTo find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, `n=1`. One particle will be spin-up, and the other will be spin-down. The energy contributed by these two particles is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E$.\n*   We place the remaining two particles in the next lowest energy level, `n=2`. Again, one will be spin-up and the other spin-down. The energy contributed by these two particles is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n    $E_g = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n#### First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)\n\nThe first excited state corresponds to the lowest possible energy excitation from the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2`, and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n*   We promote one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n*   The new configuration of particles is: two in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this configuration is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times 1^2 E) + (1 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n#### Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to find the next possible low-energy excitation from the ground state.\nLet's consider the possible excitations from the ground state configuration (two particles in `n=1`, two in `n=2`):\n*   **Excitation 1**: Move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. This gives the first excited state with energy 15E.\n*   **Excitation 2**: Move one particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest available level, `n=3` (since `n=2` is full).\n    *   Configuration: one particle in `n=1`, two particles in `n=2`, one particle in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy: $E = (1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1^2 E) + (2 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Excitation 3**: Move two particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, two particles in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy: $E = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1^2 E) + (2 \\times 3^2 E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, ...), we find the lowest energies for the system are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
