    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it is optically active. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be chiral are the presence of a chiral center or other elements of chirality (like axial, planar, or helical chirality) and the absence of any internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   This molecule contains a C=C double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane.\n    *   This planarity creates a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups).\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters. The `(E)` specifies the geometry of a double bond.\n    *   Naming a compound with specific absolute configurations (R/S) implies that it is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. A single enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   The only exception would be if the molecule were a *meso* compound (an achiral compound with stereocenters). However, the structure and the naming `(3aR,7aS)` for the given complex skeleton do not correspond to a typical meso compound. The presence of the unsymmetrical `=(E)-CHCl` substituent further ensures the molecule lacks the necessary symmetry to be achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is a specific chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as the substituents on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other -CH(CH3)COOH group). These are called equivalent stereocenters.\n    *   For molecules with two equivalent stereocenters, the diastereomer with the `(R,S)` or `(S,R)` configuration is a *meso* compound.\n    *   A meso compound has stereocenters, but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. In its anti-periplanar conformation, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a center of inversion.\n    *   Since it is achiral, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` isomer is a diastereomer of the meso `(2R,3S)` form.\n    *   The mirror image of the `(2R,3R)` isomer is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. These two `(R,R)` and `(S,S)` isomers are non-superimposable and form a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Since the `(2R,3R)` isomer is a single enantiomer and is chiral, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH=CH- (part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (the other part of the ring). Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule does not possess any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   The name `(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This name describes a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptors `(1s,3s,5s)` typically refer to the relative stereochemistry, indicating that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   In this all-cis isomer, the two paths around the ring from any of the substituted carbons (C1, C3, C5) are identical. For example, from C1, the path C1-C2-C3(-OH)... is the same as C1-C6-C5(-OH)... Therefore, C1, C3, and C5 are not technically chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The IUPAC name `butan-1-one` designates a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. This requires a substituent on C1, which is the `1-cyclopentyl` group. The `3-methyl` is a substituent on C3 of the butane chain.\n    *   The structure is: `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers (sp3 carbons with four different substituents).\n    *   The only potential candidate is C3 of the butan-1-one chain.\n    *   The four groups attached to C3 are:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -CH3 (the C4 of the butane chain)\n        3.  -CH3 (the methyl group from the \"3-methyl\" substituent)\n        4.  -CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl (the rest of the molecule)\n    *   Since two of the groups attached to C3 are identical methyl groups, C3 is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no other stereocenters and is achiral. It has a plane of symmetry in a suitable conformation.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No\n2.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Yes**\n3.  (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: No\n4.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Yes**\n5.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Yes**\n6.  (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No\n7.  1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
