    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Initial Dilution Calculation**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid ($V_1$) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid ($M_1$) = 0.05 M\n*   Final volume after adding water ($V_2$) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n*   Using the dilution formula $M_1V_1 = M_2V_2$, we find the new concentration ($M_2$):\n    $M_2 = (M_1V_1) / V_2 = (0.05 M \\times 20.00 \\text{ cm}^3) / 40.00 \\text{ cm}^3 = 0.025 \\text{ M}$\n\nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is **0.025 M**.\n\n### **Step 2: Titration Analysis and Equivalence Point**\n\nThe titration reaction is:\n$CH_3COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) \\rightarrow CH_3COONa(aq) + H_2O(l)$\n\n*   **Moles of acetic acid (HA):**\n    Moles = Concentration $\\times$ Volume = $0.025 \\text{ mol/L} \\times 0.0400 \\text{ L} = 0.001 \\text{ mol}$\n*   **Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence point ($V_{eq}$):**\n    At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of $CH_3COOH$.\n    $V_{eq} = \\frac{\\text{moles of acid}}{\\text{concentration of base}} = \\frac{0.001 \\text{ mol}}{0.1 \\text{ M}} = 0.01 \\text{ L} = 10.00 \\text{ cm}^3$\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate ($CH_3COO^-$). This creates a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation**:\n    $pH = pK_a + \\log\\left(\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\\right)$\n*   First, calculate the pKa:\n    $pK_a = -\\log(K_a) = -\\log(1.85 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 4.73$\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base to acid is 25% to 75%:\n    $\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = \\frac{25\\%}{75\\%} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    $pH = 4.73 + \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 4.73 - \\log(3) \\approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253$\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to sodium acetate ($CH_3COONa$). The solution now contains 0.001 mol of the conjugate base, acetate ($CH_3COO^-$). The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, making the solution basic.\n$CH_3COO^-(aq) + H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons CH_3COOH(aq) + OH^-(aq)$\n\n*   **Total volume at equivalence point:**\n    Volume = (Initial acid volume) + ($V_{eq}$ of NaOH) = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([A⁻]):**\n    $[A^-] = \\frac{\\text{moles of acetate}}{\\text{total volume}} = \\frac{0.001 \\text{ mol}}{0.0500 \\text{ L}} = 0.02 \\text{ M}$\n*   **Calculate Kb for the acetate ion:**\n    $K_b = \\frac{K_w}{K_a} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 5.41 \\times 10^{-10}$\n*   **Calculate the hydroxide concentration ([OH⁻]):**\n    We use the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction: $K_b = \\frac{[CH_3COOH][OH^-]}{[CH_3COO^-]}$\n    Let $[OH^-] = x$. Then $[CH_3COOH] = x$ and $[CH_3COO^-] = 0.02 - x$.\n    Assuming $x$ is small compared to 0.02:\n    $K_b \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n    $x^2 \\approx (5.41 \\times 10^{-10}) \\times 0.02 = 1.082 \\times 10^{-11}$\n    $x = [OH^-] = \\sqrt{1.082 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx 3.29 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ M}$\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    $pOH = -\\log([OH^-]) = -\\log(3.29 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx 5.48$\n    $pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52$\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nI will use Python to verify these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants ---\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_acid_conc = 0.05\ninitial_acid_vol = 0.020 # in Liters\ndilution_water_vol = 0.020 # in Liters\nbase_conc = 0.1\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution ---\ndiluted_acid_conc = (initial_acid_conc * initial_acid_vol) / (initial_acid_vol + dilution_water_vol)\n# diluted_acid_conc is 0.025 M\n\n# --- Moles and Veq ---\nmoles_acid = diluted_acid_conc * (initial_acid_vol + dilution_water_vol)\n# moles_acid is 0.001 mol\nVeq = moles_acid / base_conc\n# Veq is 0.01 L or 10.00 cm3\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at 25% Titration ---\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, the ratio is 25/75 or 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Step 4: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq = (initial_acid_vol + dilution_water_vol) + Veq\n# Concentration of conjugate base (acetate)\nconc_A_minus = moles_acid / total_vol_eq\n# Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# [OH-]^2 = Kb * [A-]\n# x = [OH-]\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus)\npOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_at_eq_point = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_at_eq_point:.2f}\")\n```\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is: 4.26\nThe pH at the equivalence point is: 8.52\n\nThese calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "### **Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Understand the initial state:** The problem starts with the dilution of a weak acid (acetic acid, $CH_3COOH$). I need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution *after* dilution, as this is the solution that will be titrated.\n\n2.  **Dilution Calculation:**\n    *   Initial volume of acetic acid ($V_1$) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Initial concentration of acetic acid ($M_1$) = 0.05 M\n    *   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Final volume of the solution ($V_2$) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   Use the dilution formula $M_1V_1 = M_2V_2$ to find the new concentration ($M_2$).\n    *   $M_2 = \\frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \\frac{(0.05 \\text{ M}) \\times (20.00 \\text{ cm}^3)}{40.00 \\text{ cm}^3} = 0.025 \\text{ M}$.\n    *   So, we are titrating a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n3.  **Titration Reaction:** The reaction between acetic acid (a weak acid, HA) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base, BOH) is:\n    $CH_3COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) \\rightarrow CH_3COONa(aq) + H_2O(l)$\n    This is a 1:1 molar reaction.\n\n4.  **Calculate pH at 25% Titration:**\n    *   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the initial moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate ($CH_3COO^-$). 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted.\n    *   This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid ($CH_3COOH$) and its conjugate base ($CH_3COO^-$).\n    *   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is perfect for this situation: $pH = pK_a + \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{conjugate base}]}{[\\text{acid}]}\\right)$ or $pH = pK_a + \\log\\left(\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\\right)$.\n    *   First, calculate the $pK_a$ from the given $K_a$:\n        $K_a = 1.85 \\times 10^{-5}$\n        $pK_a = -\\log(K_a) = -\\log(1.85 \\times 10^{-5})$\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio $\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = \\frac{25\\%}{75\\%} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   Plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n        $pH = pK_a + \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = pK_a - \\log(3)$\n\n5.  **Calculate pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The only species affecting the pH is the product, sodium acetate ($CH_3COONa$), which dissociates into $Na^+$ (a spectator ion) and $CH_3COO^-$ (the conjugate base).\n    *   The acetate ion ($CH_3COO^-$) will hydrolyze in water, creating a basic solution:\n        $CH_3COO^-(aq) + H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons CH_3COOH(aq) + OH^-(aq)$\n    *   To find the pH, I need to find the concentration of $OH^-$. This requires a few steps:\n        a.  **Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid:**\n            Moles = $M_2 \\times V_2 = 0.025 \\text{ mol/L} \\times 0.0400 \\text{ L} = 0.001 \\text{ mol}$.\n            At the equivalence point, this is also the number of moles of acetate ($CH_3COO^-$) formed.\n        b.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point ($V_{eq}$):**\n            moles of acid = moles of base\n            $0.001 \\text{ mol} = (\\text{Concentration of NaOH}) \\times (V_{eq})$\n            $0.001 \\text{ mol} = (0.1 \\text{ M}) \\times (V_{eq})$\n            $V_{eq} = \\frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \\text{ L} = 10.00 \\text{ cm}^3$.\n        c.  **Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:**\n            Total Volume = (Volume of diluted acid) + ($V_{eq}$ of NaOH) = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n        d.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion, [A⁻], at the equivalence point:**\n            $[A^-] = \\frac{\\text{moles of acetate}}{\\text{total volume}} = \\frac{0.001 \\text{ mol}}{0.050 \\text{ L}} = 0.02 \\text{ M}$.\n        e.  **Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis of acetate:** Use the base dissociation constant, $K_b$.\n            We need to find $K_b$ from $K_a$ using the relation $K_a \\times K_b = K_w = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$.\n            $K_b = \\frac{K_w}{K_a} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \\times 10^{-5}}$.\n        f.  The equilibrium expression is $K_b = \\frac{[CH_3COOH][OH^-]}{[CH_3COO^-]}$.\n            Let $x = [OH^-] = [CH_3COOH]$.\n            $K_b = \\frac{x^2}{[A^-] - x}$. Since $K_b$ is very small, we can approximate $[A^-] - x \\approx [A^-]$.\n            $K_b \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$.\n            Solve for $x = [OH^-]$.\n        g.  Calculate pOH from $[OH^-]$: $pOH = -\\log([OH^-])$.\n        h.  Calculate pH: $pH = 14.00 - pOH$.\n\n6.  **Final Check:** Consolidate the two calculated pH values and match them with the given options. The pH at 25% should be less than the pKa (4.73), and the pH at the equivalence point should be greater than 7 (since it's a weak acid-strong base titration). The calculated values from the code `(4.26, 8.52)` fit these criteria and match one of the options.\n\nThe Python code performed these calculations accurately.\n\n*   **Calculation for 25% Titration:**\n    *   $pK_a = -\\log(1.85 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 4.733$\n    *   $pH = 4.733 + \\log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 \\approx 4.256$\n*   **Calculation for Equivalence Point:**\n    *   $[A^-] = 0.02$ M\n    *   $K_b = \\frac{10^{-14}}{1.85 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 5.405 \\times 10^{-10}$\n    *   $[OH^-] = \\sqrt{K_b \\times [A^-]} = \\sqrt{(5.405 \\times 10^{-10}) \\times 0.02} \\approx \\sqrt{1.081 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx 3.288 \\times 10^{-6}$ M\n    *   $pOH = -\\log(3.288 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx 5.483$\n    *   $pH = 14 - 5.483 \\approx 8.517$\n\nRounding the results to two decimal places gives 4.26 and 8.52. These values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
