    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:** The core principle to solve this problem is the conservation of total energy. In a closed system, the total energy remains constant. For the harmonic oscillator, the energy transforms between potential energy (stored in the \"spring\") and kinetic energy (of the mass).\n\n2.  **Formulating Energy in a Relativistic Context:**\n    *   The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is the same as in classical mechanics: $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position. We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ is given by $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $mc^2$ is the rest energy.\n    *   The total conserved energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy: $E_{total} = K + U = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Key Points in the Oscillation:** We consider two specific points in the oscillator's motion to apply the conservation of energy principle.\n\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum Displacement (Amplitude A)**\n        *   At the maximum amplitude, the position is $x = A$.\n        *   The mass momentarily stops before changing direction, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n        *   When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0}} = 1$.\n        *   The kinetic energy is $K_1 = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\n        *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U_1 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   Therefore, the total energy of the system is $E_{total} = K_1 + U_1 = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position ($x = 0$)**\n        *   At the equilibrium position, the net force is zero, and the acceleration is zero, but the speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   The kinetic energy is at its maximum: $K_2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n        *   The potential energy is zero: $U_2 = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        *   Therefore, the total energy of the system is $E_{total} = K_2 + U_2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Applying Energy Conservation:** Since the total energy must be the same at both points:\n    $E_{total} (\\text{at } x=A) = E_{total} (\\text{at } x=0)$\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solving for the Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$):**\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n        $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    *   Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    *   To solve for $v_{max}$, we can first invert both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    *   Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    *   Isolate the term with $v_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The derived expression for the maximum speed matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
