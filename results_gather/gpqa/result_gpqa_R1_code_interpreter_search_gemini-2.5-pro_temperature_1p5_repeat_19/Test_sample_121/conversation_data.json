    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, specifically an α-bromination. While the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3/Br2, this combination of reagents achieves the same outcome. Acetic anhydride can help form an acyl bromide intermediate, and pyridine acts as a base to facilitate enolization and neutralize the HBr byproduct. The bromine then adds to the alpha-carbon (the methyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** BrCH2COOH (α-bromoacetic acid).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** BrCH2COOCH2CH3 (ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (a good leaving group) from the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** NCCH2COOCH2CH3 (ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step synthesis that results in a cyclic compound.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate. The CH2 group is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt), making these protons acidic. This forms a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]Na+ + H2\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]Na+ + Br(CH2)5Br → NCCH(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br + NaBr\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation & Cyclization:** Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-proton on the newly formed intermediate.\n        NCCH(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br + NaH → [NC-C(-)(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br]Na+ + H2\n    4.  This new carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the bromine at the other end of the pentyl chain. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\nNow we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** The carbon atom C1 is a chiral center because it is attached to four different groups: (1) a -CN group, (2) a -COOCH2CH3 group, (3) the C2 of the ring, and (4) the C6 of the ring. Because the molecule has a chiral center and the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule has no plane of symmetry or any other symmetry elements.\n*   **Chemical Equivalence:** Protons are chemically distinct if they cannot be interchanged by a symmetry operation or rapid conformational change. In a molecule with no symmetry, all protons are in principle distinct, unless made equivalent by local rapid rotation (like in a methyl group).\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **-O-CH2-:** These two protons are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. In a rigorous sense, they are chemically distinct. However, they are four bonds removed from the chiral center (C1-C(=O)-O-CH2). In practice, the difference in chemical shift is often negligible, and they appear as a single signal. Since 13 (the fully rigorous count) is not an option, we must apply a simplification. Treating these two protons as equivalent is the most common and plausible one. This will produce **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring (-C6H10-):**\n    *   The ring has 5 methylene (-CH2-) groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6. There are a total of 10 protons on the ring.\n    *   Due to the complete lack of symmetry, the environment of C2 is different from C6, C3 is different from C5, and C4 is unique.\n    *   Furthermore, within each CH2 group on the ring, the two protons (the axial and equatorial ones in any given chair conformation) are diastereotopic. They are not made equivalent by the rapid chair-flipping. For example, replacing the axial proton on C2 with a deuterium atom gives a different diastereomer than replacing the equatorial proton.\n    *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct. This will produce **10 signals**.\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   From the ethyl CH3 group: 1 signal\n*   From the ethyl CH2 group (simplified): 1 signal\n*   From the cyclohexane ring protons: 10 signals\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 10 = **12 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\nThis number matches one of the options. Other simplifications (like imposing a pseudo-symmetry on the ring) are chemically less sound and lead to other answers like 8 or 5. The reasoning for 12 is the most consistent with chemical principles while acknowledging the practicalities that force a small simplification to match the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
