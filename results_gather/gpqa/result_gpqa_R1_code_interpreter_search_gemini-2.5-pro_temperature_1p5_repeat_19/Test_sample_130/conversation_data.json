    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is given:\n    *   `1H NMR`: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two equivalent protons in the same chemical environment, likely vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond) that are deshielded.\n    *   `13C NMR`: Two peaks at 137 ppm (characteristic of C=C carbons) and 165 ppm (characteristic of carbonyl C=O carbons).\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Its dehydration product is **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinylic protons and a plane of symmetry, matching the `1H` NMR data. It also has two equivalent vinylic carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, matching the `13C` NMR data. Therefore, the anhydride reactant is maleic anhydride.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The second reactant is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene suitable for a Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the reaction and the products.**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The general structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system fused with the anhydride ring.\n*   The reaction produces two stereoisomers: the **endo** and **exo** products. Typically in Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is kinetically favored and thus the **major product**, while the *exo* product is the **minor product**.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3. Let's verify:\n    *   Diene (C9H14): 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   Dienophile (C4H2O3): Maleic anhydride.\n    *   Product (C9H14 + C4H2O3 - H2O?) No, it's an addition reaction. Formula of diene is C5H2(CH3)4 = C9H14. Formula of dienophile is C4H2O3. Total: C(9+4)H(14+2)O3 = C13H16O3. The formula given in the question is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the products and predict their NMR signals.**\n\n*   The product molecule (both endo and exo isomers) has a plane of symmetry.\n*   Let's identify the different types of protons and their expected signals in the `1H NMR` spectrum:\n    1.  **Bridgehead Methyls (`Me_bridgehead`)**: Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Expected chemical shift: ~1.0-1.3 ppm (shielded, attached to sp3 C).\n    2.  **Vinylic Methyls (`Me_vinyl`)**: Two methyl groups on the double bond carbons (C5 and C6). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Expected chemical shift: ~1.7-2.0 ppm (deshielded, attached to sp2 C).\n    3.  **Anhydride Protons (`H_anhydride`)**: Two protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (C2 and C3). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **2H singlet**. Expected chemical shift: ~3.0-4.0 ppm (deshielded by adjacent C=O).\n    4.  **Bridge Protons (`H_bridge`)**: Two protons of the CH2 group at the C7 bridge. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **2H singlet** or an AB quartet. Expected chemical shift: ~1.5-2.5 ppm.\n\n**Step 4: Use the NOESY data to distinguish between the major and minor products.**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The question states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we need to find a pair of proton groups that are close in the major (*endo*) isomer but far apart in the minor (*exo*) isomer.\n*   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 bridge. This geometry places the `H_anhydride` protons (which point away from the bridge) close to the `Me_vinyl` groups on the C5=C6 double bond. **A strong NOE cross-peak between `H_anhydride` and `Me_vinyl` is expected.**\n*   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. This geometry places the `H_anhydride` protons far away from the `Me_vinyl` groups. **The NOE cross-peak between `H_anhydride` and `Me_vinyl` would be absent or very weak.**\n*   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak connects the `H_anhydride` protons and the `Me_vinyl` protons.\n\n**Step 5: Match the proton groups to the signals described in the options.**\n\n*   Based on our chemical shift predictions:\n    *   `H_anhydride` ≈ 3.5 ppm (a 2H singlet)\n    *   `Me_vinyl` ≈ 1.7 ppm (a 6H singlet)\n*   The distinguishing cross-peak in the major product connects the resonance at ~1.7 ppm (6H) and the resonance at ~3.5 ppm (2H).\n*   Let's check the options:\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (problematic signal description).\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (problematic) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`).\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`). The distance between these groups is similar in both isomers, so an NOE would be present in both, not just the major one.\n    *   D) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`)**. This matches our analysis perfectly. The NOE between these two groups is strong in the major (endo) product and weak/absent in the minor (exo) product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
