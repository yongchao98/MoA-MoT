    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product Structure**: The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring lactone (a delta-lactone). It has a single chiral center at position 4, where the ethyl group is attached. Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer, and Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **Starting Material Structure**: The options provided suggest the starting material is (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid. Let's number the carbon chain starting from the carboxylic acid end:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)`\n    This molecule has two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1 and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu) at C5. The chiral center is at C3.\n\n*   **Reducing Agents and Their Selectivity**:\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce both esters and carboxylic acids. However, it typically reduces esters faster than carboxylic acids. For the reaction to produce a lactone, it must first form a hydroxy acid. This implies a selective reduction where only one of the two functional groups is reduced. Given the subsequent lactonization, the ester must be reduced to an alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid intact.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent is highly selective. It readily reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but is generally unreactive towards esters under the same conditions.\n\n### **2. Trace the Reaction Pathways**\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction**: `LiBH₄` selectively reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`  →  `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n    The intermediate is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n2.  **Lactonization**: The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group (`-OH`) at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the six-membered lactone product.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction**: `BH₃` selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`  →  `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n    The intermediate is a 5-hydroxy ester.\n2.  **Lactonization**: The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group at C1 attacks the ester at C5 to form the six-membered lactone product, releasing isobutanol.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) R/S designation changes, even though the 3D arrangement of atoms at the chiral center is not altered by the reactions.\n\n**Step 3.1: Assign CIP Priorities to Substituents**\n\n*   **For the Starting Material (A and B)** at the chiral center (C3):\n    The groups are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu.\n    *   Priority 1: `-CH₂COOiBu` (The -O-iBu outranks the -OH of the acid)\n    *   Priority 2: `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   Priority 3: `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   Priority 4: `-H`\n\n*   **For the Product Lactone** at the chiral center (C4):\n    The groups are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), and two groups within the ring.\n    *   Priority 1: `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (part of the ring towards the carbonyl)\n    *   Priority 2: `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (part of the ring towards the ether oxygen)\n    *   Priority 3: `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   Priority 4: `-H`\n\n**Step 3.2: Map the Groups and Priorities for Each Reaction**\n\n*   **Reaction 1 (LiBH₄ path)**:\n    *   The `-CH₂COOiBu` group (Start Priority 1) gets reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` part of the ring (Product Priority 2).\n    *   The `-CH₂COOH` group (Start Priority 2) becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` part of the ring (Product Priority 1).\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. This swap causes an **inversion of the R/S designation**.\n    *   Therefore, an (S)-configured starting material will yield an (R)-configured product.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1**: To obtain the **(R)-lactone**, starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2 (BH₃ path)**:\n    *   The `-CH₂COOiBu` group (Start Priority 1) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` part of the ring (Product Priority 1).\n    *   The `-CH₂COOH` group (Start Priority 2) gets reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` part of the ring (Product Priority 2).\n    *   The priority order of the groups is preserved. This results in **retention of the R/S designation**.\n    *   Therefore, an (S)-configured starting material will yield an (S)-configured product.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2**: To obtain the **(S)-lactone**, starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the stereochemical analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are identical. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
