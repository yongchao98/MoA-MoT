    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and equilibria.**\n    In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species is given as c(Co) = 10⁻² M. The thiocyanate concentration is [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. We assume this is the free (unbound) thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium, as it is in 10-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration.\n\n    The formation reactions and their overall stability constants (β) are:\n    *   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ;       β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n    *   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ;     β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n    *   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ;    β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n    *   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ;   β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n2.  **Formulate the mass balance for cobalt.**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n3.  **Express all species concentrations in terms of [Co²⁺] and [SCN⁻].**\n    Using the stability constant expressions from step 1, we can write:\n    *   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n    Substitute these into the mass balance equation:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n4.  **Calculate the fraction of the desired complex.**\n    We want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]. The fraction of this species, denoted as α₂, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\n    Substitute the expressions from step 3:\n    α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\n    The [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the known stability constants and the free ligand concentration:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n5.  **Substitute the numerical values and compute the result.**\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n\n    Let's calculate each term in the expression:\n    *   **Numerator**: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   **Denominator**:\n        *   1\n        *   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   Sum of denominator terms = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n    Now, calculate α₂:\n    α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n    Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis can be efficiently calculated using a short script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Thiocyanate concentration\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the individual terms for the distribution function\n# The general term is beta_n * [L]^n\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * scn_conc\nterm2 = beta2 * math.pow(scn_conc, 2)\nterm3 = beta3 * math.pow(scn_conc, 3)\nterm4 = beta4 * math.pow(scn_conc, 4)\n\n# The sum of all terms forms the denominator\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The term for the complex of interest, [Co(SCN)2], is the numerator\nnumerator = term2\n\n# The fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex is alpha2\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\npercentage=16.916180326482276\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
