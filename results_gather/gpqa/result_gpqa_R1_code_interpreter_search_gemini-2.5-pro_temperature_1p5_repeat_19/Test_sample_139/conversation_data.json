    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Substance X** contains a heavier isotope of an element.\n    *   X reacts violently with liquid **Y**.\n    *   This reaction produces a gas **W**. A molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   A precipitate **G** is formed.\n    *   Heating G releases substance **B**.\n    *   The melting point of B is ~277 K.\n    *   X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its reaction with a keto acid yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. X has a \"very close analog\" also used in organic chemistry.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:**\n    The crucial clue is that gas W has an equal number of protons (p) and neutrons (n). Let's examine common diatomic gases using the most common isotopes:\n    *   H₂ (¹H): 2p, 0n. No.\n    *   N₂ (¹⁴N): 14p, 14n. Yes.\n    *   O₂ (¹⁶O): 16p, 16n. Yes.\n    *   CO (¹²C, ¹⁶O): 14p, 14n. Yes.\n    *   NO (¹⁴N, ¹⁶O): 15p, 15n. Yes.\n\n    However, the clue about the \"heavier isotope\" strongly suggests we should consider isotopes. Let's look at hydrogen's heavier isotope, Deuterium (D or ²H), which has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   **D₂ (²H₂):** Each atom has 1p, 1n. The D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the condition perfectly and incorporates the \"heavier isotope\" clue. This is a very strong candidate for W.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance B:**\n    The melting point of B is ~277 K.\n    *   277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an almost exact match. So, **B is heavy water, D₂O.**\n\n4.  **Identify Substances X, Y, and G:**\n    *   If gas W is D₂ and B is D₂O, it strongly implies a reaction system involving deuterated compounds.\n    *   Let's hypothesize X is a deuteride reagent. A common class of such reagents are complex metal hydrides used for reduction in organic chemistry. A powerful one is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated version would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Its \"very close analog\" would be LiAlH₄, a staple in organic chemistry labs. This fits the clue.\n    *   LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic solvents. If B (D₂O) is produced by heating G, it's likely that the initial liquid reactant, Y, was also D₂O. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with D₂O, so **Y is D₂O.**\n    *   Let's write the reaction:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)\n    *   In this reaction, Aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, is insoluble in water and would form a precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃.**\n    *   Now, let's check if heating G (Al(OD)₃) produces B (D₂O):\n        2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O (B)\n    *   This decomposition reaction is correct.\n\n5.  **Confirm with the Organic Chemistry Clue:**\n    *   A keto acid has two functional groups: a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent. It reduces both ketones to secondary alcohols (-CH(OH)-) and carboxylic acids to primary alcohols (-CH₂OH).\n    *   R-C(=O)-R'-COOH + LiAlD₄ (followed by workup) → R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂OH\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms our identification of X as a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Solve the Final Calculation:**\n    *   **Substance X is LiAlD₄.**\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its heavier isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   We need the atomic masses (mass numbers) of the most common/relevant isotopes:\n        *   Li: ⁷Li (mass ≈ 7)\n        *   Al: ²⁷Al (mass = 27)\n        *   D: ²H (mass = 2)\n    *   Identify the lightest and heaviest elements by mass:\n        *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (as Deuterium), mass = 2\n        *   Heaviest element: Aluminum, mass = 27\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses\" of these elements in the molecule, specifying that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\"\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄.\n        Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al) in LiAlD₄.\n        Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Sum of these cumulative masses:**\n        Sum = (Total mass of H) + (Total mass of Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated sum is 35, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
