    "*   **Analysis of the First Reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Reactants:** Butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN provides the nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻).\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a classic nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group, known as cyanohydrin formation.\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  The pi bond of the carbonyl group breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n        3.  This negatively charged alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺). The reaction is typically performed in a solution that can provide these protons, either from a weak acid like HCN (which can be formed in situ from NaCN and an acid) or by adding an acid in a subsequent workup step. H₃O⁺ represents a source of acid (e.g., adding HCl or H₂SO₄ in water), which serves to protonate the alkoxide. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺ is a suitable reagent. NaHSO₃ is used for forming bisulfite addition products and is incorrect for this reaction. This narrows down the choices to A and B.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Second Reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Transformation:** The nitrile group (-C≡N) is converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile. Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base. The presence of H₂O in the reaction indicates hydrolysis.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong acid catalyst (like HCl or H₂SO₄) and water, the nitrile is hydrolyzed through an amide intermediate to a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong base (like NaOH), the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylate salt, which must then be acidified to yield the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B is the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n        *   **HCl (hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid and an excellent catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. While it can protonate the nitrile, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions. Strong mineral acids are the standard reagents for this transformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Comparing the options for B, HCl is a much more effective and standard reagent for nitrile hydrolysis than CH₃COOH.\n\n*   **Final Selection:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺ is correct.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl is the most appropriate reagent.\n    *   Therefore, the correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
