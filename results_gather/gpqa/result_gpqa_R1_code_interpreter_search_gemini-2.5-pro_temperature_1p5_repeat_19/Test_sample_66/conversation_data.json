    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state, denoted by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1$: orbital angular momentum of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2=1$: orbital angular momentum of electron 2.\n    *   $l=2$: total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system. This arises from the coupling of $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$. The possible values for $l$ are $|l_1 - l_2|, ..., l_1 + l_2$, which are $|1-1|, ..., 1+1$, so $l=0, 1, 2$. The system is specifically in the $l=2$ state.\n    *   $m=-1$: the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). This means the eigenvalue of the total $L_z$ operator is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement and Final State:** We are performing a simultaneous measurement of the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the joint probability of a specific outcome.\n    *   The outcome for electron 1 is an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$. The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ are $m_1\\hbar$. For this to be $-\\hbar$, the magnetic quantum number for electron 1 must be $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The outcome for electron 2 is an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$. The eigenvalues of $L_{2z}$ are $m_2\\hbar$. For this to be $-\\hbar$, the magnetic quantum number for electron 2 must be $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the final state we are projecting onto is the uncoupled state characterized by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Relate Initial and Final States using Quantum Mechanics Principles:** The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle$, to be in a specific final state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the two states:\n    $P = |\\langle \\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    In our case:\n    *   $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ (in the coupled basis, with $l_1=1, l_2=1$ implied).\n    *   $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = |m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ (in the uncoupled basis, with $l_1=1, l_2=1$ implied).\n\n    So, the probability is:\n    $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n    The term $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation Laws / Selection Rules:** A crucial property of angular momentum addition is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The initial state, $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$, is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with a total magnetic quantum number $m=-1$. So, $L_z |l=2, m=-1\\rangle = -1\\hbar |l=2, m=-1\\rangle$.\n    *   The final state, $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$, is also an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator. Its eigenvalue is $(m_1 + m_2)\\hbar = (-1 + (-1))\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. So, $L_z |m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle = -2\\hbar |m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Use Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** A fundamental theorem in quantum mechanics states that eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n    *   The initial state has an $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$.\n    *   The final state has an $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$.\n    *   Since the eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$) are different, the states must be orthogonal.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability:** Orthogonality means their inner product is zero:\n    $\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThis result is also captured by the selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which states that the coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is non-zero only if $m = m_1 + m_2$. In this problem, $m = -1$ while $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$. Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the coefficient is zero, and the probability is zero.\n\nIt is physically impossible to find the system in a state where the sum of the z-components of angular momentum is $-2\\hbar$ when it was prepared in a state where the total z-component of angular momentum is definitively $-1\\hbar$. The measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ does not change the total $L_z$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
