    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the product from the given NMR data.**\n\nThe problem provides the ¹H and ¹³C NMR data for the product formed from the reaction of compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O). Since the reaction conditions (high temperature, non-nucleophilic base) suggest a rearrangement, the product will also have the formula C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\nLet's deduce the structure of the product from the NMR spectra:\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, most likely a **ketone**, as there are no signals for an aldehyde proton in the ¹H NMR.\n    *   The signals at **δ 21.3 ppm** and **δ 28.4 ppm** are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to two carbon atoms.\n    *   The remaining eight signals are in the aromatic/vinylic region (δ 126.9 - 144.1 ppm).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)**: These are two separate signals, each a singlet integrating to 3 protons. This unambiguously indicates the presence of **two methyl (CH₃) groups**, each attached to a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no hydrogen atoms attached).\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**: This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**: These are two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton. They are coupled to each other and their chemical shifts are in the vinylic region, indicating a **disubstituted alkene** moiety (**-CH=CH-**).\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a ketone group (C=O).\n    2.  We have two methyl groups (-CH₃). Since both are singlets, they must be attached to carbons without protons.\n    3.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    4.  We have a -CH=CH- group.\n\n    Let's assemble these pieces to match the formula C₁₁H₁₂O.\n    *   A para-disubstituted ring where one substituent is a methyl group gives a **p-tolyl group** (`CH₃-C₆H₄-`). This accounts for C₇H₇ and one of the methyl singlets (e.g., δ 2.31).\n    *   The remaining fragment must have the formula C₁₁H₁₂O - C₇H₇ = C₄H₅O.\n    *   This C₄H₅O fragment must contain the ketone (C=O), the other methyl group (-CH₃), and the vinyl group (-CH=CH-). Let's assemble this fragment: `-CO-CH=CH-CH₃`. In this structure, the terminal methyl group would be a doublet, not a singlet.\n    *   Let's try another assembly. The ketone is an acetyl group (`-CO-CH₃`). This accounts for the second methyl singlet (δ 2.28).\n    *   Now, let's combine all the pieces: a `p-tolyl` group, a `-CH=CH-` group, and an acetyl group (`-CO-CH₃`). The most logical connection is `p-tolyl-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   The proposed product is **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    *   Let's verify the formula: C₇H₇ (p-tolyl) + C₄H₅O (from -CH=CH-CO-CH₃) = C₁₁H₁₂O. The formula is correct.\n    *   Let's verify the NMR signals with this structure:\n        *   `Ar-CH₃`: singlet, ~2.3-2.4 ppm (matches `δ 2.31`).\n        *   `CO-CH₃`: singlet, ~2.2-2.3 ppm (matches `δ 2.28`).\n        *   Aromatic protons on `p-tolyl` ring: two doublets, 2H each (matches `δ 7.08` and `δ 7.71`).\n        *   Vinylic protons `-CH=CH-`: two doublets, 1H each (matches `δ 6.75` and `δ 7.68`).\n    *   This structure perfectly matches all the provided NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Starting Material (Compound X).**\n\nThe reaction is a rearrangement, so compound X must be an isomer of the product, `(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one`. All options are vinyl epoxides, which are known to rearrange to unsaturated carbonyl compounds.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\n*   A) **2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**: `C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-[epoxide]`. This compound contains a `phenyl` group and one methyl group. The product contains a `p-tolyl` group and an additional methyl group. This is an incorrect match.\n*   B) **2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**: `C₆H₅-CH=CH-[epoxide with CH₃]`. This compound also contains a `phenyl` group and one methyl group. This is an incorrect match.\n*   C) **2-styrylepoxide**: Formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match C₁₁H₁₂O. This is incorrect.\n*   D) **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**: `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-[epoxide]`. The substituent is a `4-methylstyryl` group, which already contains the `p-tolyl` moiety present in the product.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve the Discrepancy and Conclude.**\n\nThere is a clear inconsistency in the problem statement. The product, `(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one`, has **two** methyl groups. The starting material described by the IUPAC name in option D, `2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane` (`p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`), has only **one** methyl group. An isomerization reaction must conserve the number of atoms of each type.\n\nHowever, in a multiple-choice question context, we must select the *most plausible* answer.\n\n*   The rearrangement must start from a compound that contains the core `p-tolyl` (`4-methylphenyl`) structure, as it's highly unlikely this group would be formed from an unsubstituted phenyl ring under these conditions.\n*   Options A and B start with a `phenyl` group, while option D starts with a `4-methylstyryl` group (which is a `p-tolyl` attached to a vinyl group).\n*   Therefore, Compound X must be related to option D. The discrepancy in the number of methyl groups strongly suggests a typo in the IUPAC name provided in the option. The question likely intended a starting material that is an isomer of the product and contains the p-tolyl group. Option D is the only one that points to this correct parent structure. The reaction is a known type of rearrangement for vinyl epoxides.\n\nGiven the options, the only one that contains the necessary `p-tolyl` skeleton is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
