    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the given information from the 1H NMR spectrum.**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** All candidate compounds must have the molecular formula C10H14. Let's check this for all options.\n        *   Tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4): 6 carbons in the ring + 4 methyl carbons = 10 carbons. 2 hydrogens on the ring + 4 * 3 hydrogens on methyl groups = 14 hydrogens. Formula is C10H14. This applies to 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2): 6 carbons in the ring + 2 * 2 carbons in ethyl groups = 10 carbons. 4 hydrogens on the ring + 2 * 5 hydrogens on ethyl groups = 14 hydrogens. Formula is C10H14.\n        *   All four compounds have the correct molecular formula.\n\n    *   **Mixture:** The solution contains a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both singlets, in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n        *   This implies we are mixing two compounds, let's call them Compound X and Compound Y.\n        *   Each compound must produce a single peak (a singlet) for all its aromatic protons. This happens when all aromatic protons in a molecule are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   The 1:1 integration ratio means that the number of aromatic protons in Compound X is equal to the number of aromatic protons in Compound Y (since the molar ratio of X:Y is 1:1).\n\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n        *   This combined signal arises from the alkyl protons of both compounds.\n        *   The fact that they are all singlets means there is no proton-proton coupling for these alkyl groups. This is true for methyl (CH3) groups attached to an aromatic ring, but not for ethyl (CH2CH3) groups (which would show a quartet and a triplet).\n\n*   **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound.**\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: The four methyl groups at C1, C2, C4, and C5 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: {C1-Me, C3-Me} are equivalent (6H), {C2-Me} is unique (3H), and {C5-Me} is unique (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, or **2:1:1**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C1-C2 and C3-C4 bonds.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: {C1-Me, C4-Me} are equivalent (6H), and {C2-Me, C3-Me} are equivalent (6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, or **1:1**.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The four protons at C2, C3, C5, and C6 are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (4H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each ethyl group has a CH2 and a CH3 that are not equivalent and will couple with each other. This will produce **one quartet** (4H total) for the CH2 groups and **one triplet** (6H total) for the CH3 groups.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the options based on the combined spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.**\n\n    *   First, we can eliminate any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene. Its spectrum shows a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, but the problem states there are only singlets. Furthermore, it has 4 aromatic protons, while the other candidates have 2. A 1:1 mixture with a tetramethylbenzene isomer would give a 4H:2H or 2:1 ratio for the aromatic signals, not the observed 1:1 ratio. This eliminates **Option C**.\n\n    *   We are now left with combinations of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers. All of them give a single singlet for their 2 aromatic protons, so any 1:1 mixture of two different ones will produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This part of the data fits options A, B, and D. We must use the alkyl region data to distinguish between them.\n\n    *   **Let's check the alkyl signals for the remaining options:**\n\n        *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n            *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n            *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n            *   Total signals: 1 + 2 = **three singlets**.\n            *   Integration ratio: 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n            *   **This matches the experimental data perfectly.**\n\n        *   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n            *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n            *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n            *   Total signals: 2 + 3 = up to five singlets. This contradicts the observation of only three signals. Even with accidental overlap of the 6H peaks, we would get four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which is not what is observed.\n\n        *   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n            *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n            *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n            *   Total signals: 1 + 3 = **four singlets**. This contradicts the observation of only three signals.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Only the mixture described in Option A produces a combined 1H NMR spectrum that matches the data provided.\n\n<<<A>>>"
