    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which is T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for a Ratio:** We are calculating a ratio of temperatures for two planets orbiting the *same star*. Therefore, `T_star` and `R_star` are constants for both planets. The problem also states that both planets have the *same albedo* (`A`). This means all terms except the semi-major axis (`a`) are constant and will cancel out in the ratio.\n\n    The relationship simplifies to:\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / a^(1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)`\n\n4.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:** Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 as:\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (1 / sqrt(a_4)) / (1 / sqrt(a_2))`\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)`\n\n5.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n    `T² ∝ a³`\n    From this, we can establish a ratio between the semi-major axes and the orbital periods:\n    `(a_2 / a_4)³ = (T_2 / T_4)²`\n    To find the ratio `a_2 / a_4`, we take the cube root of both sides:\n    `a_2 / a_4 = (T_2 / T_4)^(2/3)`\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio Formula:** Now, substitute the expression for `a_2 / a_4` back into our temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = sqrt( (T_2 / T_4)^(2/3) )`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (T_2 / T_4)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Use the Given Orbital Period Ratios:** The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as T₁:T₂:T₃:T₄:T₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we can find the ratio T₂ / T₄:\n    *   T₂ is proportional to 2.\n    *   T₄ is proportional to 3.5.\n    *   Therefore, `T₂ / T₄ = 2 / 3.5`.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the period ratio into the final equation and calculate the result.\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n    To perform the calculation:\n    `2 / 3.5 ≈ 0.571428`\n    `(0.571428)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298`\n\n    This value is approximately 0.83.\n\n```python\n# Python code to calculate the final ratio\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) is equal to (T_2 / T_4)^(1/3).\n# Given period ratio T2:T4 is 2:3.5\n\nT2_T4_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# Calculate the final temperature ratio\ntemp_ratio = T2_T4_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.8298647081702582\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.83, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user has provided a question which was solved in the previous turn. The reasoning, calculation, and code execution have already been performed.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  The equilibrium temperature `T_eq` is proportional to `1 / sqrt(a)`, where `a` is the semi-major axis.\n2.  The ratio of temperatures is therefore `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)`.\n3.  From Kepler's Third Law, `a` is proportional to `P^(2/3)`, where `P` is the orbital period.\n4.  The ratio of semi-major axes is `a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`.\n5.  Substituting this into the temperature ratio gives `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = ( (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) )^(1/2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`.\n6.  The problem gives the period ratio `P_2 : P_4 = 2 : 3.5`.\n7.  The final calculation is `(2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`.\n\n**Code Execution Result:**\n\nThe code `print((2/3.5)**(1/3))` was executed, yielding a result of approximately `0.8298`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated ratio is `~0.83`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.83\nB) ~0.69\nC) ~0.57\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
