    "This is a quantum mechanics problem involving a spin-1/2 system. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### 1. State Normalization\n\nThe initial state `|alpha>` is given as being proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nLet `|psi_un> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nTo normalize the state, we need to find the normalization constant `C` such that `|alpha> = C |psi_un>` and `<alpha|alpha> = 1`.\n\nThe inner product `<psi_un|psi_un>` is:\n`<psi_un|psi_un> = <(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down| | (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>>`\n`= (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)`\n`= (1 - i^2) + (4 - i^2)`\n`= (1 + 1) + (4 + 1)`\n`= 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nSo, the normalization constant `C` is `1/sqrt(7)`.\nThe normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\n\nIn vector notation, where `|up> = [1, 0]^T` and `|down> = [0, 1]^T`, the state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n\n### 2. Operator Eigenstates and Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator `A` has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` for `i != j` and `Aij = 0` for `i = j`. In the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, this is a 2x2 matrix:\n`A = [ A11  A12 ] = [ 0      hbar/2 ]`\n`    [ A21  A22 ]   [ hbar/2 0      ]`\n`A = (hbar/2) * [ 0 1 ]`\n`               [ 1 0 ]`\nThis is `(hbar/2)` times the Pauli-X matrix, `sigma_x`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`lambda`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - lambda*I) = 0`:\n`det([ -lambda, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -lambda ]) = 0`\n`lambda^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\n`lambda = +/- hbar/2`\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are `lambda_1 = +hbar/2` and `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   For `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`, the eigenvector `|a1>` is `(1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]^T`, which is `(1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n*   For `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`, the eigenvector `|a2>` is `(1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]^T`, which is `(1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Probability Calculation\n\nThe probability `P_i` of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|a_i>` is given by `P_i = |<a_i|alpha>|^2`.\n\n*   **Probability P1 (for eigenvalue `+hbar/2`)**:\n    `P1 = |<a1|alpha>|^2`\n    `<a1|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `= (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) + (2-i)]`\n    `= 3 / sqrt(14)`\n    `P1 = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability P2 (for eigenvalue `-hbar/2`)**:\n    `P2 = |<a2|alpha>|^2`\n    `<a2|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `= (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) - (2-i)]`\n    `= (1/sqrt(14)) * (-1 + 2i)`\n    `P2 = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately `0.64` and `0.36`.\n\n### 4. Average Value Calculation\n\nThe average (or expectation) value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n    `<A> = P1*lambda_1 + P2*lambda_2`\n    `<A> = (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the definition `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`**\n    First, `A|alpha>`:\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [ 0 1 ] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [ 1+i ] = (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [ 2-i ]`\n    `                 [ 1 0 ]                 [ 2-i ]                       [ 1+i ]`\n    Then, `<alpha|A|alpha>`:\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ 1-i, 2+i ] * (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [ 2-i ]`\n    `                                                                      [ 1+i ]`\n    `= (hbar/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `= (hbar/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]`\n    `= (hbar/14) * [1 - 3i + 1 + 3i]`\n    `= (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A are `9/14 (~0.64)` and `5/14 (~0.36)`. The average value of the operator A is `hbar/7`.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
