    "*   **Analyze the provided information:**\n    *   **Â¹H NMR:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and a combined integral of 1H, with roughly equal individual integrals. This implies there are two different molecular species present in a roughly 1:1 ratio, and in these two species, the chemical environment of that specific alpha-proton is slightly different. Spin-spin coupling is ruled out.\n    *   **LC-MS:** The analysis shows two separate peaks in the liquid chromatogram, indicating two distinct compounds that can be separated by chromatography. These peaks have equal intensities, reinforcing the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR. Critically, both peaks yield the *same* mass spectrum, which matches the mass of the *expected* molecule. The analysis is done at elevated temperature, and the peaks are still clearly defined, suggesting the two species are stable and not just rapidly interconverting conformers (rotamers) with a low energy barrier.\n\n*   **Evaluate the options based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. The data shows both species have the same mass as the final product. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and on a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single NMR signal and a single LC peak. This observation contradicts the data. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they have different 3D structures, corresponding protons in diastereoisomers exist in different chemical environments and will have different chemical shifts in a standard NMR experiment. This explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. This explains the two peaks in the LC trace.\n        *   **MS:** Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and the same molecular weight. This explains why both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum.\n        *   **Origin:** In peptide synthesis, if one of the chiral amino acid starting materials undergoes epimerization (inversion of stereochemistry) at its alpha-carbon, the result is a mixture of diastereomers (e.g., a mixture of L-L dipeptide and D-L dipeptide). This is a common side reaction. The alpha-proton of the epimerized residue would be the one showing two distinct signals. This scenario perfectly fits all the experimental observations.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies that an extra amino acid has been added to the peptide, for example, on a side chain. This would create a molecule with a different chemical formula and a higher molecular weight. The mass spectrum would not be consistent with the *expected* molecule. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two separable isomers of the same mass, which are distinguishable by NMR, points unequivocally to a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
