    "Here is a thinking process to solve the chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   Initial state: An equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. Total mass = 7.20 g.\n    *   Process: Heated to 200°C. All of the mixture decomposes into a gas mixture. No solid residue remains.\n    *   Gas Analysis: The gas mixture is passed through three sequential traps.\n        *   Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂ (a dehydrating agent, absorbs H₂O). Mass increases by 3.60 g.\n        *   Tube 2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater, absorbs acidic gases like CO₂). Mass does not change.\n        *   Tube 3: Red-hot copper (reacts with O₂). Mass increases by 0.80 g.\n    *   Final state: 2.24 L of a remaining gas, C, at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Question: Find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salt A and salt B.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Gas Products:**\n    *   **Tube 1 (H₂O):** The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube 2 (Acidic Gas):** The mass did not change. This is a critical piece of information. It means no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂, etc.) were produced during the decomposition.\n\n    *   **Tube 3 (O₂):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen reacting with copper (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO). The mass gain is the mass of the oxygen.\n        *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):**\n        *   Volume = 2.24 L at STP.\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation:**\n    *   The initial mass of the salt mixture was 7.20 g. According to the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Total Mass of Gases = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   7.20 g = 4.40 g + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass(C) = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A diatomic gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol is Nitrogen (N₂), where M(N₂) = 2 * 14.0 g/mol = 28 g/mol. This is consistent with the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n4.  **Determine the Identity of Salts A and B:**\n    *   We have identified all the products and their amounts:\n        *   0.20 mol H₂O\n        *   0.025 mol O₂\n        *   0.10 mol N₂\n    *   These products came from two equimolar salts, A and B. The atoms involved are H, O, and N. This strongly suggests ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   Let's find the molar ratio of the products by dividing by the smallest value (0.025 mol):\n        *   H₂O : O₂ : N₂ = (0.20/0.025) : (0.025/0.025) : (0.10/0.025) = 8 : 1 : 4.\n    *   The overall decomposition produces products in the ratio 8 H₂O : 1 O₂ : 4 N₂.\n    *   We need to find two decomposition reactions of ammonium salts that, when combined for an equimolar mixture, give this ratio.\n    *   Consider the decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):\n        *   Reaction 1: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + 4H₂O(g) + O₂(g)\n        *   Reaction 2: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   Let's test if an equimolar mixture of these two salts works. Suppose we take 2 moles of NH₄NO₃ and 2 moles of NH₄NO₂.\n        *   From 2NH₄NO₃: we get 2 N₂, 4 H₂O, and 1 O₂.\n        *   From 2NH₄NO₂: we get 2*(N₂) = 2 N₂ and 2*(2H₂O) = 4 H₂O.\n    *   Total products from the 1:1 molar mixture:\n        *   N₂: 2 + 2 = 4 moles\n        *   H₂O: 4 + 4 = 8 moles\n        *   O₂: 1 + 0 = 1 mole\n    *   The product ratio is N₂ : H₂O : O₂ = 4 : 8 : 1. This matches our experimentally determined ratio perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, the salts A and B are Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n5.  **Verify Moles and Mass:**\n    *   The overall reaction for the equimolar mixture corresponds to `2NH₄NO₃ + 2NH₄NO₂ → 4N₂ + 8H₂O + O₂`.\n    *   We produced 0.025 mol of O₂. The reaction stoichiometry shows 1 mole of O₂ is produced. This means the entire reaction must be scaled down by a factor of 0.025.\n    *   So, moles of NH₄NO₃ reacted = 2 * 0.025 = 0.05 mol.\n    *   And, moles of NH₄NO₂ reacted = 2 * 0.025 = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The initial mixture was 0.05 mol of A and 0.05 mol of B, confirming it was equimolar.\n    *   Let's check the initial mass:\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n        *   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n        *   Total Mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given initial mass.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   Now that we have identified the salts, we can answer the question.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n        *   Number of atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O\n        *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n        *   Number of atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 2 O)\n        *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms in salts A and B** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define molar masses and constants\nM_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\nM_O2 = 31.998   # g/mol\nV_STP = 22.4     # L/mol\n\n# Step 2: Calculate moles of products from given data\nmass_H2O = 3.60  # g\nmass_O2 = 0.80   # g\nvol_C = 2.24     # L\n\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\nmoles_O2 = mass_O2 / M_O2\nmoles_C = vol_C / V_STP\n\n# Step 3: Identify Gas C by calculating its molar mass\ninitial_mass = 7.20 # g\nmass_C = initial_mass - mass_H2O - mass_O2\nM_C = mass_C / moles_C\n\n# The molar mass of C is ~28 g/mol, so C is N2.\nM_N2 = 28.014 # g/mol\n\n# Step 4: Identify Salts A and B\n# Based on reasoning, the salts are Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3) and Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2)\n# Let's verify the mass for an equimolar mixture.\n# The overall reaction for the equimolar mixture can be written as:\n# NH4NO3 + NH4NO2 -> 2N2 + 4H2O + 0.5O2\n# From the moles of O2 produced (0.025 mol), we can find the moles of the salts.\n# moles_salt_mixture = moles_O2 / 0.5 = 0.025 / 0.5 = 0.05 mol of the pair.\n# This means we started with 0.05 mol of NH4NO3 and 0.05 mol of NH4NO2.\nmoles_salt = 0.05\n\nM_NH4NO3 = 14.007*2 + 1.008*4 + 15.999*3  # g/mol\nM_NH4NO2 = 14.007*2 + 1.008*4 + 15.999*2  # g/mol\n\nmass_A = moles_salt * M_NH4NO3\nmass_B = moles_salt * M_NH4NO2\ntotal_mass_calculated = mass_A + mass_B\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms\n# Salt A: NH4NO3 -> N(2), H(4), O(3)\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 3\n# Salt B: NH4NO2 -> N(2), H(4), O(2)\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 2\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Molar Mass of Gas C: {M_C:.2f} g/mol.

    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the decomposition products to identify the original salts.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Moles**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (absorbs H₂O):** The mass increased by 3.60 g. This mass corresponds to the water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (absorbs acidic gases like CO₂):** The mass did not change. This is a crucial clue, indicating that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (reacts with O₂):** The mass increased by 0.80 g. Red-hot copper reacts with oxygen (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO). The mass gain is equal to the mass of the oxygen (O₂).\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ is 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g) due to the law of conservation of mass.\n*   Total Mass = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 4.40 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can determine the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass(C) = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\nA common, non-acidic gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂). This suggests the original salts were nitrogen compounds.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe decomposition products are N₂, H₂O, and O₂. The original salts A and B must contain only Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Since they are salts that decompose fully into gases, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. Let's consider the decomposition of ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n*   Ammonium Nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium Nitrate: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + 4H₂O(g) + O₂(g) (This decomposition pathway occurs at temperatures around 200-250°C).\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture. Let's assume we have `x` moles of NH₄NO₃ and `x` moles of NH₄NO₂. The balanced reactions for the mixture would be:\n`x` NH₄NO₂(s) → `x` N₂(g) + `2x` H₂O(g)\n`x` NH₄NO₃(s) → `x` N₂(g) + `2x` H₂O(g) + `0.5x` O₂(g)  (dividing the standard equation by 2)\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = `x` + `x` = `2x`\n*   Total H₂O = `2x` + `2x` = `4x`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5x`\n\nNow let's compare the molar ratio of the products:\nN₂ : H₂O : O₂ = `2x` : `4x` : `0.5x` = 4 : 8 : 1.\n\nLet's check the experimental ratio from our calculations in step 1:\nN₂ : H₂O : O₂ = 0.10 mol : 0.20 mol : 0.025 mol\nDividing by the smallest value (0.025):\n(0.10/0.025) : (0.20/0.025) : (0.025/0.025) = 4 : 8 : 1.\n\nThe ratios match perfectly. Therefore, the salts A and B are Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4. Verify the Initial Mass**\nFrom the product ratios, we know that moles of O₂ = `0.5x`.\n*   0.025 mol = `0.5x`\n*   `x` = 0.05 mol.\nThis means the initial equimolar mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n*   Total Initial Mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g. This matches the value given in the problem.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\nNow we can find the total number of atoms in the formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of atoms in their respective formulas:\nTotal atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>"
