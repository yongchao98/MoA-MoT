    "This question asks to identify the correct starting material (A) and catalyst (B) for the synthesis of 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine from 3-methylpyrrolidine.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction type.**\n*   **Reactant:** 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine because the nitrogen atom is bonded to two carbon atoms and one hydrogen atom.\n*   **Product:** 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let's analyze this structure. The parent molecule is 3-methylpyrrolidine. The substituent at position 1 (the nitrogen atom) is `cyclohexylidenemethyl`. This name describes a group with a double bond: `-CH=C(cyclohexane ring)`. A molecule containing a nitrogen atom single-bonded to a C=C double bond is called an **enamine**.\n*   The reaction is the formation of an enamine from a secondary amine. Enamine formation is a well-known reaction in organic chemistry.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the general mechanism for enamine formation.**\nEnamines are typically formed by the reaction of a **secondary amine** with an **aldehyde or a ketone**. The reaction is catalyzed by an acid and usually involves heating to remove water, which is a byproduct, thus driving the equilibrium towards the product.\n\nReaction:\nSecondary Amine + Aldehyde/Ketone  + Acid Catalyst (B)  ---(Heat, -H₂O)---> Enamine\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Reagent A (the carbonyl compound).**\nTo figure out the structure of the starting aldehyde or ketone (Reagent A), we can perform a retrosynthetic analysis on the enamine product. Enamine formation is reversible; hydrolysis of an enamine with aqueous acid yields the parent secondary amine and the carbonyl compound.\n\n*   **Product (Enamine):** 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The structure is the 3-methylpyrrolidine ring attached via its nitrogen to the group `-CH=C(cyclohexane ring)`.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** Cleave the C=C double bond and the N-C single bond of the enamine functional group.\n    1.  Add a C=O double bond to the carbon that was single-bonded to the nitrogen. This carbon is the `-CH=` part of the `cyclohexylidenemethyl` group. So we get `O=CH-`.\n    2.  Add two hydrogen atoms to the nitrogen of the amine part. We get back 3-methylpyrrolidine.\n    3.  The other part of the cleaved C=C bond (`=C(cyclohexane ring)`) becomes the rest of the carbonyl compound.\n*   Putting it together, Reagent A must have the structure `O=CH-(cyclohexane ring)`. This compound is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n*   Let's check the options for Reagent A:\n    *   `vinylcyclohexane`: This is an alkene, not a carbonyl compound. It would not react with a secondary amine under these conditions to form an enamine.\n    *   `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`: This is an aldehyde and is the correct structure we deduced.\n\n*   Therefore, Reagent A must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This eliminates options A and D. We are left with options B and C.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the suitable Catalyst B.**\nThe reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration.\n*   **Role of the acid catalyst:** The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for the amine's attack. Crucially, it also protonates the hydroxyl group of the carbinolamine intermediate, converting it into a good leaving group (H₂O).\n*   The options for Catalyst B are:\n    *   **TsOH (p-Toluenesulfonic acid):** This is a strong organic acid (pKa ≈ -2.8). It is an excellent catalyst for dehydration reactions like enamine, imine, and acetal formation. It is widely used because it is effective in catalytic amounts and is non-nucleophilic.\n    *   **Acetic acid (CH₃COOH):** This is a weak organic acid (pKa ≈ 4.76). While it can catalyze the reaction, it is much less effective than a strong acid like TsOH. For a dehydration reaction that needs to be driven to completion, a strong acid is the preferred choice.\n\n*   Given the two choices, **TsOH** is the superior and more commonly used catalyst for enamine synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Reagent A is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n*   Catalyst B is **TsOH**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
