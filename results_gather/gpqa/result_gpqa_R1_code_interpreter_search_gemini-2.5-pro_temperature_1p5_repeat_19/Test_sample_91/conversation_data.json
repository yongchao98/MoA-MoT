    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the given molecule to count the number of atoms and the types of bonds.\nThe condensed formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's expand this to visualize the structure and count the atoms:\n\n        CH3                 CH3                 CH3\n        |                   |                   |\nH3C — C == CH — CH2 — CH — CH2 — CH == C — CH3\n                                            |\n                                            CH3\n\nNow, let's count the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   **Carbons:**\n    *   (CH3)2C= group: 1 C in the chain + 2 C in methyl groups = 3\n    *   =CH- group: 1 C\n    *   -CH2- group: 1 C\n    *   -CH(CH3)- group: 1 C in the chain + 1 C in the methyl group = 2\n    *   -CH2- group: 1 C\n    *   -CH= group: 1 C\n    *   =C(CH3)2 group: 1 C in the chain + 2 C in methyl groups = 3\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens:**\n    *   (CH3)2C=: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   =CH-: 1 H\n    *   -CH2-: 2 H\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 H in the chain + 3 H in the methyl group = 4 H\n    *   -CH2-: 2 H\n    *   -CH=: 1 H\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 hydrogens.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### **2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nFrom the structure drawn above, we can count the covalent bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds in the main chain. So, **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** Let's count them carefully:\n    *   Two C-C bonds connecting the first carbon to its two methyl groups.\n    *   One C-C bond between the 2nd and 3rd carbon atoms in the main chain.\n    *   One C-C bond between the 3rd and 4th carbon atoms.\n    *   One C-C bond between the 4th carbon atom and its methyl group branch.\n    *   One C-C bond between the 4th and 5th carbon atoms.\n    *   One C-C bond between the 5th and 6th carbon atoms.\n    *   Two C-C bonds connecting the last carbon to its two methyl groups.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) can be calculated using bond energies with the following formula, which is an application of Hess's Law:\n\n**ΔH_f = [Enthalpy required to atomize reactants] - [Enthalpy released on forming product bonds]**\n\nThe formation reaction from standard state elements is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n**Step 3a: Calculate the enthalpy required for atomization of reactants.**\nThis is the energy needed to break the reactants (12 moles of solid Carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms (12 moles of C atoms and 22 moles of H atoms).\n\n*   Atomization of 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 * 1000 kJ = 12000 kJ\n*   Atomization of 11 moles of Hydrogen (H2): 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ = 1100 kJ\n*   Total enthalpy for atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3b: Calculate the enthalpy released on forming the product molecule.**\nThis is the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in one mole of the product, C12H22.\n\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Total bond energy of the product = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ**\n\n**Step 3c: Calculate the molar enthalpy of formation.**\nΔH_f = (Atomization energy of reactants) - (Bond energy of product)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ - 11200 kJ\n**ΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **4. Convert to the Units in the Options**\n\nThe calculated molar enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options provided:\nA) 11.44 kJ/g\nB) 1900 kJ/g\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated value of 1900 kJ/mol does not match option C or D. Option B has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). Option A is in kJ/g. Let's convert our result to these units to check.\n\nTo convert from kJ/mol to kJ/g, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar mass of C ≈ 12 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of H ≈ 1 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nSpecific Enthalpy = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457... kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms and bonds\nnum_C_atoms = 12\nnum_H_atoms = 22\nnum_C_C_bonds = 9\nnum_C_eq_C_bonds = 2\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\nnum_H2_molecules = num_H_atoms / 2\n\n# Given enthalpy and bond energy values (kJ/mol)\nH_atom_C = 1000\nBE_H_H = 100\nBE_C_C = 200\nBE_C_eq_C = 300\nBE_C_H = 400\n\n# Molar mass for conversion\nmolar_mass_C = 12\nmolar_mass_H = 1\nmolar_mass_total = (num_C_atoms * molar_mass_C) + (num_H_atoms * molar_mass_H)\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n\n# 1.
