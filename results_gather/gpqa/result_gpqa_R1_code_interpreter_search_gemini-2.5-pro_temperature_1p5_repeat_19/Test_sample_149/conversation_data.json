    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the given 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula for DBE is `C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 - X/2`.\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) - 0 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a double bond or a ring). The C=O group of an aldehyde or ketone would account for this extra DBE.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Signals:**\n    *   **`9.72 ppm (t, 1H)`:** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means its neighboring carbon has 2 protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). So, we have a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **`3.66 ppm (d, 2H)`:** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. Its multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning its neighboring atom has 1 proton (1+1=2). This confirms the coupling with the single aldehyde proton. The fragment is `-CH2-CHO`.\n    *   **`6.98 ppm (d, 2H)` and `6.51 ppm (d, 2H)`:** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets and each integrates to 2 protons. This pattern is characteristic of a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts (normal benzene is ~7.3 ppm) suggest the presence of electron-donating groups.\n    *   **`6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)`:** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. This is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2) attached to an aromatic ring. The broadening is due to nitrogen's quadrupole moment and/or proton exchange.\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    We have the following fragments:\n    1.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  An amine group (-NH2).\n    3.  An ethylaldehyde group (-CH2-CHO).\n    Combining these pieces, we get 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde. Let's check its molecular formula: C6H4 (from the ring) + CH2CHO + NH2 gives C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n    The starting compound is:\n    ```\n          NH2\n          |\n         / \\\n      ==|   |==\n      | |   | |\n      ==|   |==\n         \\ /\n          |\n         CH2-CHO\n    ```\n    This is 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: `1. NaNO2 + HCl`, then `2. H2O`**\n    This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    1.  **Diazotization:** The primary amine group (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) at low temperature to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        H2N-Ar-CH2CHO -> [Cl-][+N≡N]-Ar-CH2CHO\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water (usually upon gentle warming) to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas.\n        [+N≡N]-Ar-CH2CHO + H2O -> HO-Ar-CH2CHO + N2 + H+\n\n    The product after the first two steps is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde.\n    ```\n           OH\n           |\n          / \\\n       ==|   |==\n       | |   | |\n       ==|   |==\n          \\ /\n           |\n          CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Step 3: `aq. KOH, Heat`**\n    This step involves reacting the intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat. The intermediate is an aldehyde that possesses protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- protons). These conditions are classic for an **aldol condensation** reaction. Since there is only one type of aldehyde, this will be a **self-condensation**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the mechanism and product of the aldol condensation.**\n\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate anion.\n    `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- <=> [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O`\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde.\n    `[HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + O=CH-CH2-C6H4-OH -> product`\n\n3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to form the **aldol addition product**.\n    Let's trace the carbon backbone: C1 is the aldehyde carbon. The new bond forms between the α-carbon (C2) of the first molecule and the carbonyl carbon (which becomes C3) of the second molecule.\n    The addition product is:\n    `HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n    To name this, we find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (aldehyde). This is a butanal chain.\n    `CHO(C1)-CH(C2)(Ar-OH)-CH(C3)(OH)-CH2(C4)(Ar-OH)`\n    The IUPAC name is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to **option C**.\n\n4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **Heat**. This provides the energy for a subsequent elimination (dehydration) reaction. The aldol addition product loses a molecule of water to form a more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The hydrogen on the α-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) are eliminated.\n    `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal --(Heat, -H2O)--> Product`\n    The elimination creates a double bond between C2 and C3.\n    The structure of the final product is:\n    `CHO(C1)-C(C2)(Ar-OH)=CH(C3)-CH2(C4)(Ar-OH)`\n    The IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to **option B**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction proceeds through an aldol addition to form the intermediate shown in option C. However, because the reaction is heated, the final, most stable product is the dehydrated condensation product. The conjugation of the newly formed C=C double bond with both the carbonyl group and one of the aromatic rings provides a significant thermodynamic driving force for this dehydration step. Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
