    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data to Determine the Number of Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means there are 4 hydrogen atoms attached to the benzene ring (C6H4). The fact that there are two signals for these protons is consistent with a substitution pattern like ortho or para, where protons can be chemically equivalent or have similar environments. (4H)\n    *   **Vinyl-H:** There are two signals for vinyl protons, indicating a `-CH=CH-` group. (2H)\n    *   **-CH3 groups:** There are two distinct signals for methyl groups. Each methyl group (-CH3) has 3 protons. So, in total, there are 2 * 3 = 6 protons from methyl groups. (6H)\n    *   **Total Hydrogen Count:** Summing up the protons from all signals gives the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule: 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Filter the Options Based on the Hydrogen Count:**\n    The molecular formula must have 12 hydrogen atoms. Let's check the given options:\n    A) C11H12O2 (H=12) -> Possible\n    B) C12H12O2 (H=12) -> Possible\n    C) C11H14O2 (H=14) -> Incorrect\n    D) C12H14O2 (H=14) -> Incorrect\n    This eliminates options C and D. We are left with A and B.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Determine the Structural Fragments and Carbon Count:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a `C6H4` group, which contains 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR: ester group:** This indicates the presence of a `-COO-` functional group, which contains 1 carbon atom (the carbonyl carbon).\n    *   **1H NMR - Vinyl and Methyl groups:** The description of the vinyl signals (\"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\") is highly characteristic. A doublet of quartets (dq) arises when a proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and three other adjacent protons (giving the quartet). This points to a `–CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl) group. The proton on the carbon next to the CH3 group gives the `dq` signal, and the other vinyl proton gives the `d` signal. This propenyl group contains one of the two methyl groups mentioned in the data. The propenyl fragment has 3 carbon atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR - Second Methyl Group:** Since there are two methyl signals, and one is part of the propenyl group, there must be a second, separate `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule. This group contains 1 carbon atom.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This confirms that there are no methylene bridges, ethyl groups, or other structures containing `-CH2-`. This constraint is consistent with our fragment identification.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Count the Total Carbon Atoms:**\n    The entire molecule is built from the fragments we have identified. We can determine the total number of carbon atoms by summing the carbons from each essential, non-overlapping part of the structure.\n    *   Carbon from the benzene ring (`C6H4`): 6 C\n    *   Carbon from the ester's carbonyl group (`C=O`): 1 C\n    *   Carbons from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`): 3 C\n    *   Carbon from the second methyl group (`-CH3`): 1 C\n\n    These fragments must be assembled to form a valid structure, for example, `(CH3-CH=CH)-C6H4-(COOCH3)`. Regardless of the exact arrangement (e.g., it could also be `CH3-C6H4-OOC-CH=CH-CH3`), the total number of carbons required to build a molecule with these specific parts is constant.\n\n    Total Carbon Count = 6 (ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (second methyl) = 11 carbons.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The molecule must have 11 carbon atoms and 12 hydrogen atoms. The formula must be C11H12O2. This corresponds to option A. We can also check the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This is consistent with a benzene ring (DoU=4), a C=C double bond (DoU=1), and a C=O double bond (DoU=1).\n\n<<<A>>>"
