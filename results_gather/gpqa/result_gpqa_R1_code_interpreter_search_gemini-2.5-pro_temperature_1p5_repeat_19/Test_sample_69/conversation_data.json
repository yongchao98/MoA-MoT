    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compounds and determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Hydrolysis Reaction (Clue 3)**\n\n*   The reaction is `C + H₂O -> A + F + G`.\n*   This reaction reforms the starting material `A` (a solid). This strongly suggests that `A` is an element and the reaction is a disproportionation of that element from an intermediate oxidation state in `C`.\n*   The products `F` and `G` are two different acids, one strong (`F`) and one weak (`G`).\n*   A classic example of such a hydrolysis reaction involves sulfur chlorides. For instance, the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is:\n    `2 SCl₂ + 2 H₂O -> S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4 HCl(aq)`\n*   Let's test if this fits the clues:\n    *   `A` = Sulfur (S). In its common form S₈, it is a solid. This fits.\n    *   `F` = Hydrochloric acid (HCl). This is a strong acid. This fits.\n    *   `G` = Sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), which is formed when sulfur dioxide (SO₂) dissolves in water. H₂SO₃ is a weak acid. This fits.\n    *   `C` would be a sulfur chloride, likely SCl₂.\n\n**Step 2: Verify with Reaction 1**\n\n*   The reaction is `A(s) + 8 equivalents of B(g) -> bright red product C`.\n*   Let's use our assignments from Step 1: `A = S` and `C = SCl₂`. This implies the gas `B` must be chlorine (Cl₂).\n*   The reaction would be the chlorination of sulfur. Sulfur's standard state is the crown-shaped S₈ molecule.\n    `S₈(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) -> 8 SCl₂(l)`\n*   This reaction has a stoichiometry of 1 mole of S₈ to 8 moles of Cl₂. This perfectly matches the \"8 equivalents\" of gas B per solid A.\n*   Sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is described as a \"cherry-red\" liquid, which matches the \"bright red product C\".\n*   So, our assignments are now:\n    *   **A = S** (Sulfur)\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine gas)\n    *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride)\n\n**Step 3: Identify D and H using Reaction 4**\n\n*   The reaction is `D(g) + B(g) -> H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Substituting `B = Cl₂`: `D(g) + Cl₂(g) -> H(solvent)`.\n*   We need to find a gas `D` that reacts with chlorine to form a liquid solvent. A very common reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethene (ethylene).\n    `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) -> CH₂ClCH₂Cl(l)`\n*   The product is 1,2-dichloroethane, which is a widely used solvent.\n*   This gives us:\n    *   **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene)\n    *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n**Step 4: Identify E using Reaction 2**\n\n*   The reaction is `C + 2 equivalents of D -> E (extremely hazardous product)`.\n*   Substituting our identified compounds: `SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ -> E`.\n*   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of sulfur mustard:\n    `SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ -> S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`\n*   Sulfur mustard, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`, is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. This fits the description perfectly.\n*   Thus, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂** (Sulfur mustard).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\n*   The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of `E`, which is sulfur mustard, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n*   The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent (AX₂E₂ system, similar to H₂O).\n*   The molecule is flexible due to rotation around the S-C and C-C single bonds. We need to consider its stable conformations.\n*   Let's analyze the symmetry elements for plausible conformations:\n    *   The molecule does not have high symmetry like D₄h or D∞h.\n    *   A `C₂ᵥ` point group (like water) would require two perpendicular mirror planes. This is sterically hindered and extremely unlikely for a molecule with two flexible ethyl chains.\n    *   The molecule can adopt a conformation where the two `CH₂CH₂Cl` arms are arranged in a way that the entire molecule can be rotated by 180° around an axis passing through the sulfur atom and bisecting the C-S-C angle, and remain unchanged. This operation is `C₂`.\n    *   In such a conformation, there are typically no other symmetry elements (like mirror planes or an inversion center).\n    *   While the absolute lowest energy conformer might have no symmetry (C₁ point group), a stable, low-energy conformer with `C₂` symmetry is known to exist. Given the options, this is the intended answer.\n\nThe symmetry elements are the identity (E) and a twofold rotation axis (C₂). A group with only these elements is the **C₂** point group.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) D4h\nB) C2v\nC) C2\nD) D∞h\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
