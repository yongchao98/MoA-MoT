    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be redshifted when moving away from us and blueshifted when moving towards us. The magnitude of this wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) relative to the observer:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light. The problem gives the maximum periodic shift, which corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, also known as the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to RV Semi-Amplitude (K):** Since the maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) is proportional to the RV semi-amplitude ($K$), the ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two stars is equal to the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts.\n    Let $K_1$ and $K_2$ be the RV semi-amplitudes for star 1 and star 2, respectively.\n    Let $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms be the corresponding maximum wavelength shifts.\n    Then, the ratio is:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n3.  **Use the Formula for RV Semi-Amplitude:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) of the host star is given by the formula:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin i}{(M_{star} + M_{planet})^{2/3}}$\n    Where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $M_{planet}$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Formula Based on Given Information:** The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2} = M_s$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $M_{planet1} = M_{planet2} = M_p$.\n    *   Since this is a multiple-choice question with a specific answer, we make the standard and necessary assumption that the orbital inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$). Without this assumption, the problem is not solvable with the given information.\n\n    Under these conditions, most terms in the formula are constant for both systems. We can write a proportionality relationship:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio of Periods and Amplitudes:** Using the proportionality from step 4, we can write the ratio for our two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:** We need to find \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which is the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. We can rearrange the equation from step 5:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes from step 2 into the equation from step 6:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n    Now, we compute the numerical value.\n```python\nprint((5/7)**3)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe result is approximately 0.3644.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics (Radial Velocity Method):** The problem describes the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. This method relies on the Doppler effect. As a planet orbits a star, it causes the star to \"wobble\" slightly. This wobble induces a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines. The maximum wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity, also known as the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.\n\n2.  **Establish the Relationship between Wavelength Shift and RV Semi-Amplitude (K):**\n    Given that $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, we can write a ratio for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n    Where:\n    *   $K_1$ and $K_2$ are the RV semi-amplitudes for star 1 and star 2.\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms (for planet #1).\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms (for planet #2).\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n3.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    The formula for the RV semi-amplitude for a planet in a **circular orbit** is:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{(M_s + M_p)^{2/3}}$\n    Where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_s$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Formula based on the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$).\n    *   The planets have similar masses ($M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$).\n    For a solvable problem of this nature, we must assume that the viewing geometries are similar, meaning the orbital inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$).\n    Under these conditions, all terms in the formula ($G$, $M_p$, $M_s$, $\\sin i$) are effectively constant for both systems except for the orbital period, $P$. This leaves us with a proportionality:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Form a Ratio to Solve for the Period Ratio:**\n    Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can relate the semi-amplitudes to the periods:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    We want to find \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which is the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. We can solve for this by cubing both sides of the equation:\n    $\\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_2}{P_1}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    Now substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes from step 2 into the equation from step 5:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n    The numerical value is:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated ratio ~0.3644 matches option B. The result means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1 (i.e., it is shorter). This is consistent with our physical intuition: planet #2 induces a larger stellar wobble (larger K), which for a given mass implies a closer, faster orbit and thus a shorter period.\n\n<<<B>>>"
