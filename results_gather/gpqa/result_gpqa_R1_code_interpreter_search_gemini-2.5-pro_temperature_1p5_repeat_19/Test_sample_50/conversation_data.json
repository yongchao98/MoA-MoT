    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Setup\n\nWe have a system composed of:\n*   A conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to a reservoir of charge (the Earth) and its electric potential is held constant at V = 0.\n*   A point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (`d > R`).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charge on the surface of the conducting sphere. We need to find the total potential energy of this entire configuration.\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\n\nThis problem is most elegantly solved using the \"method of images.\" The core idea is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a simple, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition of the problem, which is that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero (V=0).\n\nFor a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` that satisfies the V=0 boundary condition is:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** Located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\nSo, for any point outside the sphere, the electric field and potential due to the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere are identical to the field and potential created by the charge `q` and its image `q'`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of this system.\n\n#### Method 1: Work Done to Assemble the System\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is equal to the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position `d`. The work is done against the electrostatic force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n`U = W_external = ∫(infinity to d) F_external ⋅ dl = -∫(infinity to d) F_electrostatic ⋅ dl`\n\nThe electrostatic force `F_electrostatic` on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by the sphere. Using the method of images, this is simply the force exerted by the corresponding image charge.\n\nWhen `q` is at a distance `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at a distance `b(x) = R^2/x`. The distance between the charge and its image is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\nThe force on `q` is (using Coulomb's Law):\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)²`\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n`F(x) = -k * q² * R / (x * (x² - R²)²/x²) = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\nThis force is attractive (negative sign). The work done by the electrostatic field to bring the charge from infinity to `d` is:\n`W_field = ∫(infinity to d) F(x) dx = ∫(infinity to d) -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)² dx`\n\nTo solve this integral, let `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`W_field = -k * q² * R / 2 * ∫(infinity to d²-R²) 1/u² du`\n`W_field = -k * q² * R / 2 * [-1/u]` from `infinity` to `d²-R²`\n`W_field = -k * q² * R / 2 * [-1/(d² - R²) - 0] = (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nThe change in potential energy is the negative of the work done by the conservative electrostatic field:\n`U(d) - U(infinity) = -W_field`.\nAssuming `U(infinity) = 0`, the potential energy of the system is:\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n#### Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula\n\nThe potential energy of a system of charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` created by all *other* charges.\n\nOur system consists of the point charge `q` and the induced surface charge `σ` on the sphere.\n`U = (1/2) [q * V_induced + ∫ σ * V_sphere dS]`\n\n*   `V_sphere` is the potential on the surface of the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, `V_sphere = 0`. So the integral term is zero.\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charge `σ` on the sphere.\n\nThe formula simplifies to:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nUsing the method of images, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\nThe image charge `q' = -qR/d` is located at `b = R²/d`.\nThe distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R²/d`.\nThe potential at `q` due to `q'` is:\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R²/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d * (d²/d - R²/d)) = -k * qR / (d² - R²)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d² - R²)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The potential energy of the system is:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
