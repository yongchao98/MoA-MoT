    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n\n*   **λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules**\n    *   This refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before it collides with *another gas molecule*.\n    *   This is the standard definition of mean free path in the kinetic theory of gases. The interaction is between two relatively large, neutral particles (the gas molecules). The collisions are governed by their physical size and short-range intermolecular forces.\n    *   The formula is:  `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * π * d² * n)`\n        *   `d` = kinetic diameter of the gas molecule.\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n        *   The term `√2 * π * d²` represents the effective collision cross-section for gas-gas collisions.\n\n*   **λ2: Mean Free Path of Electrons**\n    *   This refers to the average distance an electron from the microscope's beam travels before it is scattered by a *gas molecule*.\n    *   This interaction is fundamentally different. It involves a very small, point-like charged particle (the electron) interacting with the electrostatic field of a much larger, complex particle (the gas molecule, which consists of a positive nucleus and a negative electron cloud).\n    *   The formula is: `λ₂ = 1 / (σ * n)`\n        *   `σ` = total scattering cross-section for an electron-gas molecule interaction.\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules (this is the same as in the case for λ1).\n\n### **2. Compare the Nature of the Collisions (Cross-Sections)**\n\nThe key to comparing λ1 and λ2 is to compare their respective collision/scattering cross-sections. The cross-section (`σ`) is essentially the \"effective target area\" that one particle presents to another for a collision to occur.\n\n*   **Gas-Gas Collision Cross-Section (`√2 * π * d²`)**: This is based on the physical size of the molecules. Think of it as a \"billiard ball\" model. For a collision to happen, the centers of the two molecules must approach each other within a distance equal to their diameter `d`.\n\n*   **Electron-Gas Scattering Cross-Section (`σ`)**: This is not a simple physical collision. The electron interacts with the long-range electric (Coulomb) field of the gas molecule. The electron doesn't need to physically \"hit\" the molecule's nucleus or its electrons. It can be significantly deflected (scattered) just by passing through the atom's electric field, which extends well beyond its physical radius `d`.\n\n### **3. Conclusion on Cross-Sections and Mean Free Paths**\n\n1.  Because the electron interacts via the long-range electrostatic force, the effective target area it \"sees\" (`σ`) is much larger than the physical target area seen by another gas molecule (`√2 * π * d²`).\n2.  Therefore, the scattering cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule is significantly larger than the collision cross-section for two gas molecules: `σ > √2 * π * d²`.\n3.  The mean free path is *inversely proportional* to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ). A larger cross-section means a collision is more likely to happen over a given distance, which results in a shorter average path between collisions.\n4.  Since the cross-section for electron-gas scattering is larger, the corresponding mean free path (λ2) must be **smaller** than the mean free path for gas-gas collisions (λ1).\n\nThus, we can conclude that **λ2 < λ1**. Mike's observation is not a discrepancy but a direct consequence of the different physics governing the two types of interactions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
