    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThe problem involves two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds in the same direction. To find their relative speed, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula. Since they are moving in the same direction (positive x-direction), we use the formula for velocity subtraction.\n\nLet the velocity of the first astronaut be $v_1 = 0.6c$ and the velocity of the second astronaut be $v_2 = 0.5c$. The relative speed $v_{rel}$ of astronaut 1 with respect to astronaut 2 is given by:\n\n$v_{rel} = (v_1 - v_2) / (1 - (v_1 * v_2) / c^2)$\n\nNow, substitute the given values into the formula:\n$v_{rel} = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)$\n$v_{rel} = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)$\n$v_{rel} = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)$\n$v_{rel} = 0.1c / 0.7$\n$v_{rel} = (1/7)c$\n\nTo express this as a decimal:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857c$\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a system is the sum of the individual energies of its components. The total relativistic energy of a single particle is given by the equation $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n$\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$\n\nThe total energy of the system ($E_{total}$) is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts ($E_1$ and $E_2$):\n\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 + \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2$\n\n**Calculate the energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n- Mass ($m_1$) = 2m\n- Velocity ($v_1$) = 0.6c\n\nFirst, find the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n$\\gamma_1 = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2}$\n$\\gamma_1 = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - 0.36}$\n$\\gamma_1 = 1 / \\sqrt{0.64}$\n$\\gamma_1 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25$\n\nNow, calculate $E_1$:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Calculate the energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n- Mass ($m_2$) = 3m\n- Velocity ($v_2$) = 0.5c\n\nFirst, find the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2}$\n$\\gamma_2 = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - 0.25}$\n$\\gamma_2 = 1 / \\sqrt{0.75}$\n$\\gamma_2 = 1 / (\\sqrt{3}/2) = 2/\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.1547$\n\nNow, calculate $E_2$:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (2/\\sqrt{3}) * (3m) * c^2 = (6/\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_2 \\approx 2 * 1.732 * mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Calculate the total energy ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n- Relative speed: $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n- Total energy: $E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThese results match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
