    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one stereocenter at carbon C5, and its configuration is given as (S). This is an enantiomerically pure starting material.\n\n2.  **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.\n\n3.  **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH), creating a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction and retains its (S) configuration.\n    *   The reduction of the planar carbonyl group can occur from two faces, leading to the formation of both possible configurations (R) and (S) at the new stereocenter C3.\n    *   This results in two products:\n        *   **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**\n        *   **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry in its enol form and conformational symmetry in its keto form).\n\n2.  **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n\n3.  **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   Two new stereocenters are created at C2 and C4. The maximum number of stereoisomers is 2² = 4.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are formed in equal amounts (a racemic mixture).\n    *   The **(2R, 4S)** isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same single meso compound.\n    *   The products of this reaction are a mixture of three stereoisomers:\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        *   **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** (enantiomer of the above)\n        *   **meso-pentane-2,4-diol** (diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair)\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\nA normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   It can separate constitutional isomers (like the hexanol derivative vs. the pentanediol derivative).\n*   It can separate diastereomers because they have different physical properties, including polarity.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (This is a diastereomer of Peak 1, so it separates).\n*   Peak 3: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (This is a diastereomer of all other products and will separate).\n*   Peak 4: A single peak containing both (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (These are enantiomers and will not be separated; they co-elute).\n\nTherefore, on a normal-phase HPLC, we will observe **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\nA chiral HPLC column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This allows it to interact differently with enantiomers, enabling their separation.\n*   It can separate all different stereoisomers: constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n\nLet's count the peaks by listing all the unique stereoisomers in the mixture:\n*   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   Peak 3: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Peak 4: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Peak 5: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (This is the enantiomer of Peak 4 and will be separated by the chiral column).\n\nTherefore, on a chiral HPLC, we will observe **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that there will be 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
