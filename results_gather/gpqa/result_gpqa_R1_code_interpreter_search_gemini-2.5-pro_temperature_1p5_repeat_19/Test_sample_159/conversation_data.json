    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture's Geometry:**\n    The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where all apothems have the same length 'a'. An apothem is the line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side. The question asks for the case where N is infinitely large (N → ∞).\n\n    As N → ∞, a regular polygon approaches a circle. In this limit, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics of Diffraction from a Circular Aperture:**\n    When monochromatic light of wavelength λ passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The intensity `I` of the diffracted light at an angle `θ` from the central axis is given by:\n\n    `I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `I₀` is the maximum intensity at the center (θ = 0).\n    *   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n    *   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n\n3.  **Determine the Positions of the Minima:**\n    The intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sinθ)` is equal to zero, while the denominator is non-zero. This means we need to find the values of `x = k * a * sinθ` that are the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\n    Let the zeros of `J₁(x)` be denoted by `j₁,m` where `m = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n\n    So, for the m-th minimum, we have:\n    `k * a * sin(θ_m) = j₁,m`\n\n    Substituting `k = 2π / λ`:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ_m) = j₁,m`\n\n    Rearranging for `sin(θ_m)`:\n    `sin(θ_m) = (j₁,m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n    The problem states we can use the small-angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. Thus, the angular position of the m-th minimum is:\n    `θ_m = (j₁,m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n4.  **Find the Numerical Values for the Zeros of the Bessel Function:**\n    We need the first two non-trivial zeros of the `J₁(x)` function. These are well-established mathematical constants.\n    *   First zero, `j₁,₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `j₁,₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    *   **First Minimum (m=1):**\n        `θ₁ = (j₁,₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2 * 3.14159)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)`\n\n    *   **Second Minimum (m=2):**\n        `θ₂ = (j₁,₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2 * 3.14159)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.116 * (λ / a)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima:**\n    The question asks for the angular distance *between* the first and second minima. This is the difference `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [ (j₁,₂ - j₁,₁) / (2π) ] * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ [ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / 6.2832 ] * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    Let's check our calculated value against the given options:\n    A) 1.220 λ/a (This is approximately `2 * θ₁`, the angular width of the central maximum)\n    B) 0.500 λ/a\n    C) 0.506 λ/a (This matches our result)\n    D) 0.610 λ/a (This is the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`)\n\nOur calculated value `0.5067 * (λ / a)` is best represented by option C.\n\nFor higher precision, we can use a computational approach.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.special as sc\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The problem simplifies to finding the diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n# The minima are located at angles θ_m where k*a*sin(θ_m) are the zeros of the J1 Bessel function.\n# For small angles, θ_m ≈ (j_1,m * λ) / (2π * a), where j_1,m is the m-th zero of J1(x).\n\n# We need the angular distance between the first two minima, which is θ_2 - θ_1.\n# Δθ = (j_1,2 - j_1,1) / (2π) * (λ / a)\n# We need to calculate the coefficient C = (j_1,2 - j_1,1) / (2π).\n\n# sc.jn_zeros(n, nt) returns the first nt positive zeros of the Bessel function Jn(x).\n# Here, n=1 (for J1) and we need the first 2 zeros.\nzeros = sc.jn_zeros(1, 2)\nj1_1 = zeros[0]\nj1_2 = zeros[1]\n\n# Calculate the coefficient C\ncoefficient = (j1_2 - j1_1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(coefficient)\n```\n\nThe computed coefficient matches our manual calculation.

    "An N-sided polygon where N approaches infinity becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity of the diffracted light at an angle θ from the central axis is given by the formula:\n\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²`\n\nWhere:\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the argument of the Bessel function corresponds to the zeros of `J₁(x)`. The first term `J₁(0) = 0` corresponds to the central maximum, so we are interested in the subsequent zeros. Let the non-trivial zeros of `J₁(x)` be `j₁,m` (for m = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = j₁,m`\n\nSubstituting `k = 2π / λ`:\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ_m) = j₁,m`\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. Thus, the angular position of the m-th minimum is:\n`θ_m = (j₁,m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which corresponds to `m=1` and `m=2`.\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n`Δθ = [ (j₁,₂ * λ) / (2π * a) ] - [ (j₁,₁ * λ) / (2π * a) ]`\n`Δθ = [ (j₁,₂ - j₁,₁) / (2π) ] * (λ / a)`\n\nThe values for the first few zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)` are well-known:\n*   `j₁,₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `j₁,₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can calculate the coefficient:\n`Coefficient = (j₁,₂ - j₁,₁) / (2π)`\n`Coefficient ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * 3.14159)`\n`Coefficient ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832`\n`Coefficient ≈ 0.5067`\n\nThe python code executed in the background confirms this with higher precision, giving `0.5067303515575121`.\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately `0.506 * (λ / a)`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1.220 λ/a  (This corresponds to `(j₁,₁/π) * λ/a` or `1.22 * λ/(2a)`, which is the angular diameter of the Airy disk)\nB) 0.500 λ/a\nC) 0.506 λ/a\nD) 0.610 λ/a (This corresponds to the position of the first minimum `θ₁`)\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
