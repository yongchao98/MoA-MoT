    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the problem:** The question asks for the decay path and the associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through a process involving \"two dipole transitions\". This implies a two-step cascade process:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle + \\gamma_1$\n    $|\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle + \\gamma_2$\n\n2.  **Apply Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    For an E1 transition to occur, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta n = n_{final} - n_{initial}$ can be any integer.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle = |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n        *   For a decay, the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3 ($n'<3$).\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $\\Delta l = l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$, which means the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (a p-orbital).\n        *   Let's check the possible values of $n'$ for an $l'=1$ state:\n            *   If $n'=1$, the only possible value for $l$ is $l=0$. There is no $|1,1,m'\\rangle$ state.\n            *   If $n'=2$, the possible values for $l$ are $l=0,1$. A state with $l=1$ is allowed, which is the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (the 2p state).\n        *   Therefore, the only possible intermediate state level is the 2p level.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $\\Delta m = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. This means the intermediate state can be $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition: $|\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   Let's verify if this transition is allowed:\n            *   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$ (Allowed).\n            *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed, since $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$).\n            *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. Since the possible values for $m'$ are $0, \\pm 1$, the value of $\\Delta m$ will be $0$ (for $m'=0$), $-1$ (for $m'=1$), or $+1$ (for $m'=-1$). All these are allowed.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on the path:** The decay must proceed via the cascade $3s \\rightarrow 2p \\rightarrow 1s$. The options provided show different paths corresponding to the different magnetic sublevels ($m'$) of the intermediate 2p state. All three paths are allowed by the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route:**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route, for example, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   The overall probability of this route is the product of the probability of the first step and the probability of the second step.\n    *   The probability of the first step, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$, is its branching ratio. The branching ratio is the rate of this specific transition divided by the total decay rate of the initial state.\n    *   The total decay rate of the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. As determined above, the only allowed decay channel is to the 2p level.\n    *   Total Rate $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) + \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) + \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle)$.\n    *   The transition rate from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2$. We need to calculate this for the three possible intermediate states.\n    *   Rate($m'$) $\\propto |\\langle 2,1,m'|e\\vec{r}|3,0,0\\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (or 3s) is spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. This means the atom has an equal probability of transitioning to any of the available degenerate final states. Therefore, the transition rates to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equal.\n\n    Let's verify this with a calculation. The rate for spontaneous emission is proportional to the sum of the squared matrix elements for the x, y, and z components of the position operator:\n    Rate$(m') \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m' |x| 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m' |y| 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m' |z| 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n    Due to the properties of the spherical harmonics and the position operator, it can be shown that this quantity is the same for $m'=-1, 0, 1$. Let the rate for each be $A$.\n    *   $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = A$\n    *   $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = A$\n    *   $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = A$\n    The total rate is $\\Gamma_{total} = A+A+A = 3A$.\n    The branching ratio for the transition to the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state is:\n    $BR = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{A}{3A} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    So, the probability of the first step $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n\n    *   Now, consider the second step: $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. The 2p state ($|2,1,m'\\rangle$) has only one possible decay channel under E1 rules: the 1s state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). Therefore, any atom that reaches the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state with a probability of 1.\n\n    *   The total probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the probabilities of each step: $P = (\\frac{1}{3}) \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability, it should also be 1/3)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability, it should also be 1/3)\n\n    The only option that matches the calculation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
