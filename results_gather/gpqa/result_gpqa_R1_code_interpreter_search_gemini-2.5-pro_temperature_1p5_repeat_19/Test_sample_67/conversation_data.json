    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   Initially, a spin-1/2 particle is in a strong magnetic field `B` pointing in the `+z` direction.\n*   Its magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with the field. The magnetic moment is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. For a spin-1/2 particle, the z-component of spin `Sz` has two possible eigenvalues: `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this initial setup is `H_i = -μ · B = -γ * Sz * B`. The energy is minimized when `Sz` is positive, i.e., spin up.\n*   Therefore, the particle is in the \"spin up\" state with respect to the z-axis. We denote this state vector as `|+z>`. At `t=0`, the state of the system is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n*   In this state, the expectation value of the z-component of the spin is `<Sz> = <+z|Sz|+z> = +ħ/2`.\n\n### 2. The New Situation (for t > 0)\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+y` direction with the same magnitude `B`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is:\n    `H = -μ · B = -γ * (Sx*Bx + Sy*By + Sz*Bz)`\n    Since `B` is now `(0, B, 0)`, this simplifies to:\n    `H = -γ * B * Sy`\n    where `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-direction.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the System\n\nThe state of the system `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, but we can analyze the evolution of the expectation values of the spin components directly using the Heisenberg equation of motion, which is equivalent to the classical torque equation for a precessing magnetic moment.\n\nThe equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector `<S>` is:\n`d<S>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S, H]>`\n\nLet's calculate the commutators with `H = -γ*B*Sy`:\n`d<S>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S, -γ*B*Sy]> = (iγB/ħ) <[S, Sy]>`\n\nWe need the commutation relations for the spin operators:\n*   `[Sx, Sy] = iħ*Sz`\n*   `[Sy, Sy] = 0`\n*   `[Sz, Sy] = -iħ*Sx`\n\nNow we can write the equations for each component of `<S>`:\n\n*   **x-component:**\n    `d<Sx>/dt = (iγB/ħ) <[Sx, Sy]> = (iγB/ħ) (iħ<Sz>) = -γB<Sz>`\n\n*   **y-component:**\n    `d<Sy>/dt = (iγB/ħ) <[Sy, Sy]> = 0`\n\n*   **z-component:**\n    `d<Sz>/dt = (iγB/ħ) <[Sz, Sy]> = (iγB/ħ) (-iħ<Sx>) = γB<Sx>`\n\nSo we have a system of coupled differential equations:\n1.  `d<Sz>/dt = γB <Sx>`\n2.  `d<Sx>/dt = -γB <Sz>`\n3.  `d<Sy>/dt = 0`\n\n### 4. Solving for the Oscillation Frequency\n\nLet's focus on `<Sz(t)>`, which is what the question asks about (since `μz = γ*Sz`). We can solve this system by differentiating equation (1) with respect to time:\n`d²<Sz>/dt² = γB * d<Sx>/dt`\n\nNow substitute equation (2) into this expression:\n`d²<Sz>/dt² = γB * (-γB <Sz>)`\n`d²<Sz>/dt² = -(γB)² <Sz>`\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: `d²x/dt² = -Ω²x`. The general solution is `x(t) = A*cos(Ωt + φ)`.\n\nBy comparing the equations, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation `Ω`:\n`Ω² = (γB)²`\n`Ω = γB`\n\nThis frequency `Ω = γB` is known as the Larmor frequency. It is the frequency at which the spin vector precesses around the magnetic field direction. As the spin vector (initially along `+z`) precesses around the `y-axis`, its projection onto the z-axis oscillates between `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2` with the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment is `<μz(t)> = γ <Sz(t)>`. Since `<Sz(t)>` oscillates with frequency `γB`, `<μz(t)>` also oscillates with the same frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is `γB`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
