    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n    *   Mass fraction of H = 14.28% = 0.1428.\n    *   Mass fraction of C = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72% = 0.8572.\n    *   Let's find the molar ratio of C to H. Assuming a 100g sample, we have 14.28 g of H and 85.72 g of C.\n    *   Moles of H = 14.28 g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 14.17 mol.\n    *   Moles of C = 85.72 g / 12.011 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol.\n    *   The ratio of H to C is Moles H / Moles C ≈ 14.17 / 7.14 ≈ 1.985, which is approximately 2.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n    *   The mass fraction 14.28% is very close to 1/7. A hydrocarbon with the general formula (CH2)n, i.e., CnH2n, has a mass fraction of hydrogen of `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`. This matches the given data.\n    *   Z is described as a substance that does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). We will proceed with this information.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X (composed of liquids A and B) and mixture Y (composed of liquids C and D) yields *only* substance Z.\n    *   This implies that all four substances (A, B, C, and D) have the same carbon skeleton as Z. Upon addition of hydrogen, they all convert to Z.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y and Determine the Structure of Z**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (C and D) and it does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that C and D are saturated or aromatic compounds.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C = Z. Since Z is a cycloalkane (saturated), it does not decolorize bromine water, which is consistent.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. The component C=Z is already saturated and won't react. Therefore, component D must be hydrogenated to Z: `D --(H2, Pt, severe conditions)--> Z`.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated, it must be an aromatic compound. The hydrogenation conditions are described as \"rather severe,\" which is characteristic of the hydrogenation of aromatic rings.\n    *   Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). Its carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring. Then D must be an aromatic compound with a six-membered ring skeleton, which is benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane: `C6H6 + 3H2 --> C6H12`. This is consistent.\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C = Z = C6H12) and benzene (D = C6H6). Both are liquids at room temperature and cyclohexane is a common solvent. Benzene does not react with bromine water without a catalyst. This hypothesis fits all the conditions for Y and Z.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B).\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B contain non-aromatic double or triple bonds.\n    *   The problem states a disproportionation reaction occurs: `Mixture X --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y`.\n    *   Since the mixtures are equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry is likely 1:1 -> 1:1. So, `A + B --> C + D`.\n    *   Substituting our identified C and D: `A + B --> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The total atoms must be conserved. The sum of the formulas for A and B must be C12H18.\n    *   Since A and B both hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane, C6H12), they must both be C6 hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring skeleton. Let their formulas be A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy.\n    *   From the atom balance, we have x + y = 18.\n    *   We also know A and B must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water) and must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Possible unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring are:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). It has one double bond, so no conjugation. It decolorizes bromine water.\n        *   Cyclohexadienes (C6H8). There are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).\n    *   The problem states \"no conjugated multiple bonds,\" so 1,3-cyclohexadiene is ruled out.\n    *   This leaves us with cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) as the candidates for A and B.\n    *   Let's check if this pair fits the condition x + y = 18.\n    *   If A = C6H10 and B = C6H8, then x = 10 and y = 8. The sum is 10 + 8 = 18. This is a perfect match.\n    *   So, mixture X consists of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. The disproportionation reaction is: `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`. This reaction is balanced and represents the transfer of two hydrogen atoms from 1,4-cyclohexadiene to cyclohexene.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid (A) and one molecule of the second liquid (B).\n    *   Liquid A is cyclohexene, C6H10. It has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid B is 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8. It has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
