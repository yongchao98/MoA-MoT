    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Quantities:**\n    *   **Uniform Distribution of Stars:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. This means the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant number density ρ.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (d) of a star. The relationship is given by `plx = 1/d` (when `d` is measured in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds). Consequently, the distance to a star can be expressed as `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Target Quantity:** We need to find how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with `plx`. This quantity is a density function, which can be written mathematically as `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars.\n\n2.  **Start with the Number of Stars in a Volume:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars (`dN`) located in a thin spherical shell of space. This shell is centered on the Earth, has a radius `d`, and an infinitesimal thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin spherical shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² dd`.\n    *   Since the star density (ρ) is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n\n3.  **Change Variables from Distance (d) to Parallax (plx):**\n    *   Our goal is to find `dN/d(plx)`, so we need to express the right side of the equation for `dN` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We have two relationships from step 1:\n        1.  `d = 1/plx`\n        2.  To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate the first expression with respect to `plx`:\n            `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n            This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When counting stars within a certain range of parallax, we are concerned with the magnitude of the interval, so we can ignore the negative sign. Thus, `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n4.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * ( (1/plx²) d(plx) )`\n    *   Let's simplify this expression:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n    *   To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide both sides by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The term `4πρ` is a constant because `π` is a mathematical constant and ρ (the star density) is assumed to be constant.\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
