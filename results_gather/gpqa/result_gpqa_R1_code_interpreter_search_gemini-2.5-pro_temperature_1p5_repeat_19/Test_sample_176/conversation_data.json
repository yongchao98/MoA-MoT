    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 (L1 / L2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴\n    where:\n    *   R is the star's radius.\n    *   T is the star's surface temperature.\n    *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   π is the mathematical constant pi.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars, we can write the ratio of their luminosities:\n    L1 / L2 = (4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴) / (4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information about Radii:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 (R1 = 1.5 * R2). Therefore, the ratio of their radii is:\n    R1 / R2 = 1.5\n\n5.  **Relate Temperature to Peak Wavelength:** Wien's Displacement Law connects the surface temperature (T) of a black body to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted):\n    λ_emitted = b / T\n    where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant. This can be rearranged to T = b / λ_emitted.\n\n6.  **Consider the Doppler Effect:** The astronomers measured the wavelength at which the stars *appeared* brightest (the observed wavelength, λ_obs). This observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity (v) due to the Doppler effect. For speeds much less than the speed of light (v << c), the non-relativistic Doppler shift formula is a very good approximation:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)\n    where c is the speed of light.\n\n7.  **Apply Doppler Shift to Each Star:**\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is v1 = 0 km/s.\n        λ_obs1 = λ_emitted1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_emitted1\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is v2 = 700 km/s.\n        λ_obs2 = λ_emitted2 * (1 + v2/c)\n\n8.  **Use the Information about Observed Wavelengths:** The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs1 = λ_obs2). Therefore:\n    λ_emitted1 = λ_emitted2 * (1 + v2/c)\n\n9.  **Find the Temperature Ratio (T1/T2):** Now, substitute Wien's Law (λ_emitted = b / T) into the equation from the previous step:\n    b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)\n    The constant 'b' cancels out:\n    1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v2/c)\n    Rearranging to find the ratio T1/T2, we get:\n    T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the ratios for the radii and temperatures back into the luminosity ratio equation from step 3:\n    L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴\n    L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [ 1 / (1 + v2/c) ]⁴\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25 * (1 + v2/c)⁻⁴\n\n11. **Perform the Numerical Calculation:** Now, plug in the values for v2 (700 km/s) and the speed of light c (~299792.458 km/s).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\n# Ratio of radii (R1/R2)\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n# Radial velocity of Star 2 in km/s\nv2_kms = 700\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc_kms = 299792.458\n\n# The luminosity ratio is given by L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# The temperature ratio is T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c) due to the Doppler effect.\n# So, L1/L2 = (radius_ratio)^2 * (1 + v2/c)^-4\n\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio**2) * (1 + v2_kms / c_kms)**(-4)\n\nprint(f\"{luminosity_ratio:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
