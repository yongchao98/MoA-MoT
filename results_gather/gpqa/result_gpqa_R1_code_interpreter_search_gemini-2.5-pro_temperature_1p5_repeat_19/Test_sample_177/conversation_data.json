    "**1. Determine the mass dimension of the fields and the Lagrangian**\n\nIn quantum field theory, we work in natural units where $\\hbar = c = 1$. In these units, mass and energy have the same dimension, which we denote by $[M]$, and length and time have the inverse dimension, $[M^{-1}]$.\n\n*   **Action and Lagrangian:** The action $S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$ must be dimensionless. The four-volume element $d^4x$ has units of (length)$^4$, so its mass dimension is $[d^4x]_M = [M^{-4}]$. For the action $S$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of 4.\n    $[\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$.\n\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$:** The kinetic term for a fermion field is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{fermion}} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we analyze the term $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu\\psi$.\n    *   The derivative $\\partial_\\mu$ has a mass dimension of 1 (since it's an inverse length, $\\partial/\\partial x^\\mu$).\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{fermion}}]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}\\psi]_M + [\\partial_\\mu]_M = 4$.\n    *   This gives $[\\bar{\\psi}\\psi]_M + 1 = 4$, so $[\\bar{\\psi}\\psi]_M = 3$.\n    *   Since $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M$, we have $2[\\psi]_M = 3$, which means the mass dimension of the fermion field is $[\\psi]_M = 3/2$.\n\n*   **Field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$:** The kinetic term for a gauge field (like the photon) is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{gauge}} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we must have $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [F_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n    *   This implies $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$, so the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$.\n\n*   **Tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$:** The tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is defined as $\\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless constant matrices.\n    *   Therefore, their commutator is also a set of dimensionless matrices.\n    *   So, $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0$.\n\n**2. Calculate the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we analyze the given interaction Lagrangian term:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\n\nLike any other term in the Lagrangian density, this term must have a mass dimension of 4.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$\n\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa]_M + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M = -1$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**3. Determine the renormalizability of the theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by power-counting, which relates to the mass dimension of the coupling constants of its interaction terms.\n*   If a coupling constant $g$ has a mass dimension $[g]_M > 0$, the interaction is called **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant $g$ has a mass dimension $[g]_M = 0$, the interaction is called **renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant $g$ has a mass dimension $[g]_M < 0$, the interaction is called **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of -1. Since $[\\kappa]_M < 0$, the theory described by this interaction is non-renormalizable. Such terms often arise in effective field theories and signal new physics at an energy scale related to $1/|\\kappa|$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is non-renormalizable. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
