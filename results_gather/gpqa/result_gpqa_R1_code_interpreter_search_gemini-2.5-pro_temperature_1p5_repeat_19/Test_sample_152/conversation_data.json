    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), one of the acidic α-protons (the protons on the carbon between the two carbonyl groups) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position. The β-carbon (the carbon atom bonded to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  The π electrons from the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π electrons from the C=O bond shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    3.  This intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final product.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    Donor: `(H₃COOC)₂CH⁻`\n    Acceptor: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`\n    Product: `(H₃COOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`\n*   **Product Name (A):** The product is a triester. To name it systematically, we can consider the propane chain formed by the α-carbon of the malonate, and the β- and α-carbons of the acrylate.\n    - C1 from the malonate (with two -COOCH₃ groups).\n    - C2 from the acrylate's β-carbon (with the p-tolyl group).\n    - C3 from the acrylate's α-carbon (which becomes a CH₂). There is also a -COOCH₃ group attached to the chain derived from the original acrylate's ester group.\n    A common way to name such adducts is as a substituted propane tricarboxylate.\n    The structure `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe` can be named **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This name correctly identifies the propane backbone with carboxylate groups at positions 1, 1, and 3, and a p-tolyl substituent at position 2.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and serve as potent carbon nucleophiles at the α-carbon (C2 of the original cyclohexanone).\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (the CH attached to the methyl group) is the electrophilic center.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    1.  The α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium salt of the Michael adduct.\n    3.  The final step is hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺), which cleaves the iminium salt and regenerates the ketone.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    A new C-C bond is formed between the C2 of the cyclohexanone ring and the C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    The substituent added to the cyclohexanone ring is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    After hydrolysis, the product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n    Product: 2-(1-cyanopropan-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Product Name (B):** A more systematic name is to consider the compound as a substituted butanenitrile. The parent chain is butanenitrile. At position 3, there is a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group.\n    The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\nThis is a retrosynthesis problem where we need to identify the starting material 'C'.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Reagent:** KOH (a base).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Michael addition. The product is formed by adding a Michael donor (from C) to the Michael acceptor (MVK).\n    - **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one, CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the terminal CH₂).\n    - **Formation of the side chain:** When a nucleophile (Nu⁻) attacks MVK, the resulting group after protonation is `Nu-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`. This corresponds to the `-(3-oxobutyl)` group attached to the main ring in the product.\n    - **Michael Donor (C):** The `Nu-` part in our product is the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring attached at C2. Therefore, the nucleophile must be the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are particularly acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by resonance with two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Reactant Name (C):** The reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n-   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n-   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n-   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
