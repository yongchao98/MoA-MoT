    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the IR spectrum to identify functional groups in Compound X.**\n    *   The very broad absorption between 3400 and 2500 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for the C=O stretching vibration of a carbonyl group, specifically one from a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum to determine the detailed structure of Compound X.**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet is in the typical chemical shift range for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The upfield signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl chain signals:** We need to assemble the structure of the alkyl group from the remaining signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (CH₂). Fragment: **CH₃-CH₂-**\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (CH). Fragment: **CH₃-CH-**\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is the methylene group (CH₂) from our first fragment. It is adjacent to the methyl group (as required by the triplet) and also to the methine group (CH), which accounts for its complex multiplet splitting.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This multiplet for 1 proton is the methine group (CH). It is attached to the benzene ring (its benzylic position causes a downfield shift), a methyl group, and a methylene group.\n    *   **Assembling the structure of Compound X:**\n        Putting the pieces together, we have a sec-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃] attached to a benzoic acid moiety. The para-substitution is confirmed by the aromatic NMR signals.\n        Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n    *   The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a very strong reducing agent combination.\n    *   This reagent is known to reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the alkyl substituent (sec-butyl group) are unaffected under these conditions.\n    *   Reactant: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Reaction: Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Product: The carboxylic acid at position 1 becomes a methyl group, and the sec-butyl group at position 4 remains. The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Match the product with the given options.**\n    *   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our derived product.\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl group.\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
