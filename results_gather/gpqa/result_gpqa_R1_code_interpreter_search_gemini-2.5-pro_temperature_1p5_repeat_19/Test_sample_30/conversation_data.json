    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the nitration of toluene. The reagents HNO₃ and H₂SO₄ generate the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is a strong electrophile.\n*   **Reactant:** Toluene has a methyl group (-CH₃) on a benzene ring. The methyl group is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group for electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **Product 1:** The nitration of toluene yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance from the bulky methyl group at the ortho positions, the para product is the major product. In multi-step synthesis problems, we typically follow the reaction path of the major product.\n*   **Product 1 is 4-nitrotoluene.**\n\n**Structure of Product 1 (4-nitrotoluene):**\n```\n      CH₃\n      |\n     / \\\n    | O |\n   //  \\\\\n  ||    ||\n   \\\\  //\n    |   |\n     \\ /\n      |\n     NO₂\n```\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction. The reagent is manganese dioxide (MnO₂) in an acidic medium (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 is 4-nitrotoluene.\n*   **Mechanism:** MnO₂ is a specific oxidizing agent that is particularly effective at oxidizing benzylic carbons (carbons directly attached to a benzene ring). While very strong oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ would oxidize the methyl group all the way to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), the milder MnO₂ typically oxidizes a benzylic methyl group to an aldehyde group (-CHO). This interpretation is also strongly supported by the subsequent reaction step.\n*   **Product 2 is 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.**\n\n**Structure of Product 2 (4-nitrobenzaldehyde):**\n```\n      CHO\n      |\n     / \\\n    | O |\n   //  \\\\\n  ||    ||\n   \\\\  //\n    |   |\n     \\ /\n      |\n     NO₂\n```\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, between an aldehyde that has no α-hydrogens (4-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone that does (acetone, CH₃COCH₃).\n*   **Reactant 1:** Product 2 is 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n*   **Reactant 2:** Acetone.\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is the base catalyst.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate ion (`⁻CH₂COCH₃`).\n    2.  The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    3.  This forms a β-hydroxy ketone intermediate after protonation.\n    4.  This intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The double bond formed is in conjugation with both the benzene ring and the ketone's carbonyl group. The trans (E) isomer is the major product due to lower steric hindrance.\n*   **Product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one.**\n\n**Structure of Product 3 ((E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one):**\n```\n          H   H\n           \\ /\n      O=C - C=C - [Benzene Ring] - NO₂\n        |\n       CH₃\n```\nMore explicitly:\n`CH₃-C(=O)-CH=CH-(p-C₆H₄)-NO₂`\n\n**Analysis of Molecular Symmetry for Product 3**\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group, we look for symmetry elements (rotation axes, mirror planes, inversion center) in the molecule.\n\n*   The molecule has an extended conjugated system (`O=C-C=C-Ring`). For maximum stability, this entire system, including the nitro group, will tend to be planar.\n*   Let's assume the heavy atoms (C, O, N) of the molecule lie in a single plane. The hydrogen atoms attached to the benzene ring and the `C=C` double bond will also lie in this plane.\n*   The only part of the molecule that is not planar is the methyl group (`-CH₃`). The methyl group has a tetrahedral geometry.\n*   **Rotation Axes (Cₙ):** There are no C₂, C₃, or higher-order rotation axes in this molecule. The molecule is asymmetric along its length.\n*   **Inversion Center (i):** There is no point in the molecule through which all atoms can be inverted to an identical position. For example, inverting the `NO₂` group does not result in a `CH₃-C=O` group on the other side.\n*   **Mirror Plane (σ):** Consider the plane that contains the planar skeleton of the molecule (the benzene ring, NO₂, C=C, C=O).\n    *   For this plane to be a true mirror plane for the entire molecule, the methyl group must be oriented symmetrically with respect to it. This is possible in a conformation where one of the methyl C-H bonds lies within this plane, and the other two hydrogens are located symmetrically above and below the plane. Reflection through the plane leaves the atom in the plane unchanged and swaps the two hydrogens that are out-of-plane.\n    *   This is a valid conformation, and therefore the molecule possesses a single plane of symmetry (σ).\n\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that has only the identity element (E) and a single mirror plane (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\nA) C₃: Incorrect.\nB) D₂h: Incorrect.\nC) C₂h: Incorrect.\nD) Cₛ: Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
