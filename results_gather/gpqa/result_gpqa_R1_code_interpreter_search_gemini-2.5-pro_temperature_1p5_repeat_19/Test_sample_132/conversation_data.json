    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the components of the buffer:**\n    The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n    *   KH2PO4 dissolves to give K+ and H2PO4- ions. H2PO4- is a weak acid.\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissolves to give 2 Na+, HPO4^2- ions, and water. HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4-.\n    *   Therefore, we have a buffer solution consisting of the weak acid H2PO4- and its conjugate base HPO4^2-.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the acid and conjugate base:**\n    *   Volume of the solution (V) = 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L.\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol.\n\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- (from KH2PO4) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles.\n    *   Concentration of H2PO4- = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4●2H2O) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles.\n    *   Concentration of HPO4^2- = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer solution:**\n    The relevant equilibrium for this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    H2PO4⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + HPO4²⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸.\n\n    The expression for Ka2 is:\n    Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]. We will use the initial concentrations of the acid and base as they are good approximations in a buffer solution.\n    [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] = 8.106 x 10⁻⁸ M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]:**\n    The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-). This corresponds to the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    HPO4²⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + PO4³⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8 x 10⁻¹².\n\n    The expression for Ka3 is:\n    Ka3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4³⁻]. We use the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the concentration of [HPO4²⁻] from the buffer.\n    [PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    [PO4³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.106 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO4³⁻] = 6.237 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nTo streamline the calculation, we can use the following python code:\n```python\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nMw_KH2PO4 = 136.09\nMw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99\n\n# Masses (g)\nm_KH2PO4 = 1.00\nm_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00\n\n# Volume (L)\nV = 0.200\n\n# Acid dissociation constants\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Calculate initial moles\nmoles_H2PO4 = m_KH2PO4 / Mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4 = m_Na2HPO4_2H2O / Mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Calculate initial concentrations (M)\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / V\nconc_HPO4 = moles_HPO4 / V\n\n# Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer equilibrium\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# Calculate the orthophosphate concentration [PO4^3-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nPO4_3_minus_conc = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4 / H_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{PO4_3_minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n```output\n6.24e-07\n```\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the final concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) in the given solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Chemical Species:**\n    *   The solution contains water (H₂O).\n    *   1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ is added. This salt fully dissociates in water to yield K⁺ ions and dihydrogen phosphate ions (H₂PO₄⁻).\n    *   1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O is added. This salt fully dissociates in water to yield Na⁺ ions and hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO₄²⁻).\n    *   We have a mixture of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). This forms a buffer solution.\n\n3.  **Phosphoric Acid Equilibria:**\n    Phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) is a triprotic acid, meaning it donates protons in three steps:\n    *   H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ (Ka1 = 7.5 x 10⁻³)\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (Ka2 = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸)\n    *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (Ka3 = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²)\n\n4.  **Calculate Initial Molar Concentrations:**\n    *   First, calculate the number of moles of each salt.\n        *   Molar Mass of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol\n        *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n        *   Molar Mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol\n        *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Next, calculate the initial concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ in the solution.\n        *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n        *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles of KH₂PO₄ / Volume\n        *   [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O / Volume\n\n5.  **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   Since the solution is a buffer containing the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ pair, the pH (and thus [H⁺]) is governed by the second dissociation equilibrium (Ka2).\n    *   Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   We can assume that the initial concentrations of the acid and conjugate base are approximately equal to their equilibrium concentrations, which is a valid assumption for a buffer.\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n\n6.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is produced from the third dissociation step.\n    *   Ka3 = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Use the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻].\n\n7.  **Execute the Calculations with a Python Script:**\n    To ensure accuracy and avoid rounding errors, these calculations can be efficiently performed using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses in g/mol\nMw_KH2PO4 = 136.09\nMw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99\n\n# Mass of each component in g\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00\n\n# Volume of the solution in L\nvolume_L = 0.200\n\n# Acid dissociation constants for H3PO4\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / Mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / Mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / volume_L\nconc_HPO4 = moles_HPO4 / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate concentration [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nPO4_conc = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4 / H_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation to match the options\nprint(f\"{PO4_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "The calculation has been performed and verified. Here is the step-by-step reasoning leading to the final answer.\n\n### **Detailed Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Identify the Buffer System:**\n    *   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n    *   In water, KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻). H₂PO₄⁻ is a weak acid.\n    *   In water, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates into 2Na⁺ and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). HPO₄²⁻ is the conjugate base of H₂PO₄⁻.\n    *   Therefore, the solution is a buffer system composed of the weak acid/conjugate base pair: H₂PO₄⁻ / HPO₄²⁻.\n\n2.  **Calculate Molar Concentrations:**\n    *   **Volume (V):** 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n    *   **Moles of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n        *   Molar Mass of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n        *   Concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   **Moles of HPO₄²⁻:**\n        *   Molar Mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n        *   Concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   The pH of this buffer is governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid, which has the equilibrium constant Ka2.\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺] using the Henderson-Hasselbalch relationship or directly from the Ka expression. We will use the concentrations calculated above.\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.106 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka3.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Ka3 = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this equation to solve for the unknown, [PO₄³⁻].\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Now, we substitute the known values:\n        *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.106 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n        *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.237 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M (rounding to three significant figures).
