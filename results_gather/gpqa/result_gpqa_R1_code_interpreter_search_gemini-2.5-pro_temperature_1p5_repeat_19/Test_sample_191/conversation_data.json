    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have a neutral spherical conductor with a cavity inside. A positive charge $+q$ is placed within this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the entire conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply Gauss's Law and Properties of Conductors:**\n    *   A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conductor's material must be zero.\n    *   Let's consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor, enclosing the cavity.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this surface is equal to the net charge enclosed divided by $\\epsilon_o$ ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = Q_{enc}/\\epsilon_o$).\n    *   Since the electric field $\\vec{E}$ is zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface (as it's inside the conductor), the total flux is zero.\n    *   This implies that the net charge enclosed ($Q_{enc}$) by the Gaussian surface must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed in the cavity ($+q$) and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    *   Therefore, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$, which means $q_{inner} = -q$. A charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Conservation on the Conductor:**\n    *   The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral).\n    *   Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, to maintain overall neutrality, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the conductor. The total charge of the conductor remains zero ($-q$ on the inner surface + $+q$ on the outer surface = 0).\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    *   The conductor effectively shields the region outside from the charges inside the cavity. The combined electric field produced by the charge $+q$ (inside the cavity) and the induced charge $-q$ (on the inner surface) is zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the charge present on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Field from the Outer Surface Charge:**\n    *   The charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   Because the conductor is spherical and there are no other external electric fields, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface of the sphere of radius $R$. The non-uniform arrangement of charges inside the cavity does not affect the uniform distribution of charge on the outer surface due to the shielding effect of the conductor.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem, the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is $+q$.\n    *   The center of this shell is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The point P is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The information about the cavity's radius ($r$), its offset from the center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) is all extraneous for calculating the field *outside* the conductor. This information would be needed to find the field *inside* the cavity, but not outside.\n    *   Comparing our derived formula with the given options:\n        A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, ignores the conductor)\n        B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complicated and ignores shielding)\n        C) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct, matches our derivation)\n        D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complicated and ignores shielding)\n\nThe correct answer is that the field at point P is determined only by the charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\n<<<C>>>"
