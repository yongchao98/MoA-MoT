    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of substituted benzene rings (C6H5-X). The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of increasing percentage yield of the para-brominated product.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nWe need to classify each substituent based on its directing effect (ortho/para vs. meta) and its activating/deactivating nature. This is the primary factor determining the product distribution.\n\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1)  -CH3 (from Toluene)\n    2)  -COOC2H5 (from Ethyl benzoate)\n    3)  -Cl (from Chlorobenzene)\n    4)  -NO2 (from Nitrobenzene)\n    5)  -C2H5 (from Ethylbenzene)\n    6)  -COOH (from Benzoic acid)\n\n*   **Classification:**\n    *   **Ortho/Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the ortho and para positions. They generally lead to high yields of the para-isomer.\n        *   -CH3 (Alkyl group): Activating, o,p-director.\n        *   -C2H5 (Alkyl group): Activating, o,p-director.\n        *   -Cl (Halogen): Deactivating, o,p-director.\n    *   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The yields of ortho and para isomers are consequently very low.\n        *   -NO2 (Nitro group): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n        *   -COOH (Carboxyl group): Deactivating, m-director.\n        *   -COOC2H5 (Ester group): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**3. Group the Substances**\n\nBased on the classification, we can form two groups. The substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest para-isomer yields, while those with ortho/para-directing groups will have the highest yields.\n\n*   **Low Para Yield Group (m-directors):** {4 (-NO2), 6 (-COOH), 2 (-COOC2H5)}\n*   **High Para Yield Group (o,p-directors):** {3 (-Cl), 1 (-CH3), 5 (-C2H5)}\n\nTherefore, the final ordered list will look like: {m-directors in order} < {o,p-directors in order}.\n\n**4. Order the Substances within the Meta-directing Group**\n\nFor meta-directors, a stronger deactivating effect leads to a higher percentage of the meta-product and thus a lower percentage of the para-product. We need to rank the deactivating strength of -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5.\n\n*   **-NO2 (4):** This is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It will produce the highest yield of the meta-isomer and the lowest yield of the para-isomer (typically <1%). So, substance 4 will be first in the overall ranking.\n*   **-COOH (6) vs. -COOC2H5 (2):** In electrophilic substitution using a Lewis acid catalyst (like FeBr3 for bromination), the catalyst coordinates with the most basic site, the carbonyl oxygen. The basicity of the carbonyl oxygen is influenced by the group attached to it. The ethyl group (-C2H5) in the ester is electron-donating (+I effect), making the carbonyl oxygen more basic than in the carboxylic acid. This stronger coordination with the Lewis acid makes the ester-catalyst complex a more powerful electron-withdrawing (deactivating) group than the acid-catalyst complex.\n    *   Deactivating strength: -NO2 > -COOC2H5 > -COOH\n    *   Therefore, the para-isomer yield will be in the reverse order.\n    *   Order of increasing para-yield: **4 < 2 < 6**.\n\n**5. Order the Substances within the Ortho/Para-directing Group**\n\nFor o,p-directors, the ratio of para to ortho product is primarily determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will hinder attack at the adjacent ortho positions, thus increasing the relative yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **-Cl (3):** A single atom, it provides some steric hindrance. Typical para-isomer yield for bromination is ~65%.\n*   **-CH3 (1):** A methyl group is bulkier than a chlorine atom. It causes more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. Typical para-isomer yield is slightly higher, ~67%.\n*   **-C2H5 (5):** An ethyl group is significantly bulkier than a methyl group. It strongly disfavors ortho-attack. Typical para-isomer yield is very high, ~94%.\n\n*   Order of increasing steric bulk: -Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5\n*   Order of increasing para-yield: **3 < 1 < 5**.\n\n**6. Combine the Orders**\n\nNow we combine the orders of the two groups:\n\n(Order of m-directors) < (Order of o,p-directors)\n(4 < 2 < 6) < (3 < 1 < 5)\n\nThe final combined order of substances, from lowest to highest weight fraction of the para-isomer, is:\n**4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**\n\n**7. Match with the Given Options**\n\nLet's check which of the given options matches our derived sequence:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4 - Incorrect\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3 - Incorrect\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3 - Incorrect\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5 - Correct\n\nThe derived order matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
