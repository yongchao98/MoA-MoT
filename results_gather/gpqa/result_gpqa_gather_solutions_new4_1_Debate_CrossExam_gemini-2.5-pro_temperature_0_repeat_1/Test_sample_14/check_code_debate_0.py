    This function checks the correctness of the answer based on the physics of transit probability.

    The geometric transit probability (p) for a circular orbit is:
    p ∝ R_s / a
    where R_s is the stellar radius and 'a' is the semi-major axis.

    From Kepler's Third Law, a³ ∝ M_s * P², so:
    a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)
    where M_s is the stellar mass and P is the orbital period.

    Substituting 'a' into the probability formula gives:
    p ∝ R_s / (M_s * P²)^(1/3)

    We want to find the ratio p1 / p2.
    p1 / p2 = [R_s1 / (M_s1 * P1²)^(1/3)] / [R_s2 / (M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3)]
    p1 / p2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [(M_s2 * P2²) / (M_s1 * P1²)]^(1/3)
