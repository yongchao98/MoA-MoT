    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.

    ### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**

    All candidate answers that provided a detailed analysis correctly interpreted the spectroscopic data.

    *   **IR Spectrum:**
        *   The broad absorption at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is a definitive sign of an O-H bond in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.
        *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) group in a carboxylic acid, likely conjugated with an aromatic ring.
        *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ indicate C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.
        *   **Conclusion:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.

    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**
        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal confirms the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid (-COOH).
        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern is a classic indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, and the protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent.
        *   **Alkyl Region:** The signals at 0.9 ppm (triplet), 1.4 ppm (doublet), 1.7 ppm (multiplet), and 2.9 ppm (multiplet) are correctly assembled by the agents to form a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)] attached to the benzene ring.

    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the evidence, the starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

    ### **Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction**

    *   **Reagents:** The reaction is performed with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).
    *   **Transformation:** This combination is a powerful reducing agent. A key and consistent point across all analyses is that this reagent completely reduces a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl alkyl chain are stable under these conditions and do not react or rearrange.

    ### **Step 3: Identify the Final Product**

    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
    *   **Reaction:** The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.
    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

    ### **Step 4: Match the Product with the Given Options**

    This is the step where the candidate answers show significant discrepancies, not in the chemical conclusion, but in the final letter choice. It is crucial to refer to the original options provided in the question.

    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.
    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material, not the final product.
    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect. This is a different structural isomer and retains a carboxylic acid group.
    *   D) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** - **Correct.** This matches the product derived from the analysis.

    **Conclusion on Candidate Answers:**
    There is a near-unanimous agreement among the candidate answers on the chemical reasoning: Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction with Red P/HI reduces it to 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. The variation in the final lettered answers (A, B, C, or D) appears to stem from clerical errors where the agents referenced mislabeled or reordered option lists. Based on a careful analysis of the chemistry and matching the correct product to the original list of options, the final answer is D.
