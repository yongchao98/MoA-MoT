This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) is bounded by the reduced Planck constant (ħ). The relation is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can use the approximation ΔE ⋅ Δt ≈ ħ.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Terms:**\n    *   **Lifetime (τ):** This is the average time a quantum state exists before it decays. In the context of the uncertainty principle, the lifetime of the state is the uncertainty in time, so Δt = τ.\n    *   **Energy Uncertainty (ΔE):** Due to its finite lifetime, a quantum energy level is not perfectly sharp. It has a natural \"width\" or \"spread\" in energy, which is the energy uncertainty ΔE. This is also known as the natural linewidth.\n    *   **Resolvability:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the separation between their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two broadened levels will overlap too much to be seen as distinct.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth) for Each State:**\n    *   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ, in units of eV·s:\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\n    *   We have two energy levels with widths ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE₂ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   Notice that the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy uncertainty (it is a \"broader\" line). This broader line is the limiting factor for resolving the two levels.\n    *   For the two levels to be clearly distinguishable, their energy separation |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger of the two linewidths. A more stringent condition is that the separation should be greater than the sum of the widths, but being greater than the dominant (larger) width is a necessary minimum condition.\n    *   Therefore, the condition is: |E1 - E2| > ΔE₁\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    We need to find the option for the energy difference |E1 - E2| that satisfies the condition |E1 - E2| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap too much.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would be indistinguishable.\n    *   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is even smaller and thus not resolvable.\n    *   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is significantly larger than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV (since 10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷). This energy separation is large enough for the two broadened energy levels to be clearly resolved.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energy uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) is approximately 10⁻⁷ eV.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle\n\nAll the detailed candidate answers correctly identify that the problem is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. This principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which the energy of a quantum state (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) can be known. The relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). This uncertainty in energy, ΔE, is also known as the \"natural energy width\" or \"linewidth\" of the state. A shorter lifetime leads to a larger energy width.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Condition for \"Clearly Resolving\" Energy Levels\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two broadened levels will overlap to the point of being indistinguishable.\n\n*   A common criterion is that the energy separation must be greater than the larger of the two energy widths.\n*   A more stringent criterion (similar to the Rayleigh criterion) is that the separation should be greater than the sum of the two energy widths.\n\nWe will see that for this problem, both criteria lead to the same conclusion.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State\n\nUsing the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, we can calculate the energy width for each state.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Minimum Required Energy Separation\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV). This broader width is the primary limiting factor for resolving the two levels.\n\n*   Using the simpler criterion, the energy separation must be greater than the larger width: |E₁ - E₂| > 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   Using the more stringent criterion, the separation must be greater than the sum of the widths: |E₁ - E₂| > (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nIn either case, the required energy difference must be greater than approximately 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### Step 5: Compare the Required Separation with the Given Options\n\nThe options provided in the question are:\nA) 10⁻¹¹ eV\nB) 10⁻⁹ eV\nC) 10⁻⁴ eV\nD) 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nWe must find the option that is greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV** is much larger than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV (since 10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷).\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option C provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two energy levels.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Errors\n\nThe majority of the candidate answers perform the physics calculation correctly. The discrepancies in their final conclusions (e.g., <<<A>>>, <<<B>>>, <<<D>>>) arise from incorrectly mapping the calculated correct value (10⁻⁴ eV) to the lettered options. Based on the option list provided in the problem description, 10⁻⁴ eV corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
