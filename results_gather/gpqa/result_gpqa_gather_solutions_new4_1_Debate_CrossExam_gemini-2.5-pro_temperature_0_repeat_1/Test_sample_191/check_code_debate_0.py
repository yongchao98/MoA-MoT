    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the electrostatics problem.

    The problem asks for the electric field E at a point P outside a spherical conductor
    with an off-center cavity containing a charge +q.

    Key Principles:
    1.  **Electrostatic Induction & Charge Conservation:** A charge +q inside the cavity induces a charge -q
        on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface of the initially neutral conductor.
    2.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage):** The conductor shields the exterior from the fields
        of the charges inside the cavity. The external field is produced *only* by the charge on the
        outer surface.
    3.  **Symmetry & Shell Theorem:** Because the outer surface is a sphere and is shielded from the
        asymmetric interior, the +q charge distributes uniformly. The field outside a uniformly
        charged sphere is the same as if all the charge were a point charge at its center.

    The code will verify the provided answer against these principles.
