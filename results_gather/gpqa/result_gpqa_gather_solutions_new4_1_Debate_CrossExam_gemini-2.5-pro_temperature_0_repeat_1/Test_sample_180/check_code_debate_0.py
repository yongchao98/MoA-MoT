def check_neutrino_flux_ratio():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the solar neutrino flux ratio problem.

    The problem asks for the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands,
    Flux(700-800 keV) / Flux(800-900 keV), under the hypothetical condition
    that the pp-III branch (which produces Boron-8 neutrinos) has stopped.

    This check uses data from Standard Solar Models (SSM) to calculate the ratio.

    # --- 1. Define Physical Constants and Scenario ---
    # According to the problem, the pp-III branch (source of 8B neutrinos) is OFF.

    # Neutrino flux data from Standard Solar Models (e.g., BPS09(GS) model by Bahcall et al.).
    # The exact values vary slightly between models, but the orders of magnitude are consistent.

    # The 7Be neutrino source is a mono-energetic line at 861 keV (0.861 MeV).
    # Its flux is given as a total flux.
    # This line falls squarely in Band 2.
    flux_be7_line = 4.5e9  # units: cm^-2 s^-1

    # The CNO cycle neutrinos (from 13N and 15O) have a continuous spectrum.
    # We need the differential flux (flux per unit energy).
    # In the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, the combined differential flux is relatively flat.
