This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. There are two relevant forms:\n    *   Position-Momentum Uncertainty: Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ/2\n    *   Energy-Time Uncertainty: ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    (where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n\n2.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   Speed of the electron, v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s.\n    *   Uncertainty in the electron's position, Δx = 0.1 nm.\n    *   We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.\n\n3.  **Formulate a plan:** We can solve this problem in two equivalent ways.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Using Position-Momentum Uncertainty.**\n        a. Use the position-momentum uncertainty principle to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp).\n        b. Relate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).\n        c. Calculate the final value for ΔE.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using Energy-Time Uncertainty.**\n        a. Relate the uncertainty in position (Δx) to the uncertainty in time (Δt) using the electron's velocity.\n        b. Use the energy-time uncertainty principle to find the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The electron's speed (v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s) is about 2/3 the speed of light (c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s). At such high speeds, relativistic effects are significant. This means we must use the relativistic relationship between energy and momentum, not the classical one.\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   Classical: E = p²/2m\n    *   Relativistic: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n    The derivative dE/dp gives the particle's velocity, v. For the relativistic case, dE/dp = v, which leads to the simple relationship ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** All values must be in standard SI units before calculation. The position uncertainty Δx = 0.1 nm must be converted to meters (1 nm = 10⁻⁹ m).\n    *   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n*   **Minimum Uncertainty:** The uncertainty principle gives a lower bound (≥). The question asks for the *minimum* uncertainty, so we can use the equality for our estimation: Δx ⋅ Δp ≈ ħ/2. For order-of-magnitude estimates, even Δx ⋅ Δp ≈ ħ is often sufficient and won't change the final answer choice.\n\n---\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will use the first method (Position-Momentum).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp).**\n\nAccording to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\nΔx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nTo find the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality:\nΔp_min = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n*   ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   Δx = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\nΔp_min ≈ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp_min ≈ 0.527 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**Step 2: Relate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).**\n\nFor a relativistic particle, the relationship between energy and momentum is E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)². To find how a small change in momentum (dp) affects energy (dE), we differentiate this equation with respect to p:\nd(E²)/dp = d((pc)² + (m₀c²)²)/dp\n2E (dE/dp) = 2pc²\ndE/dp = pc²/E\n\nIt is a known result from special relativity that pc²/E = v, the velocity of the particle. Therefore:\ndE/dp = v\n\nWe can approximate the uncertainties using this relationship:\nΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).**\n\nUsing the values we have:\n*   v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   Δp_min ≈ 0.527 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\nΔE_min ≈ (2 × 10⁸ m/s) × (0.527 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\nΔE_min ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThe estimated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J. This value is on the order of 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem asks for the minimum uncertainty in the energy ($\\Delta E$) of an electron, given its speed ($v$) and the uncertainty in its position ($\\Delta x$).

Relating Uncertainty in Momentum to Uncertainty in Energy:**\n\nThe relationship between a particle's energy (E) and its momentum (p) is described by the energy-momentum relation. The particle's group velocity ($v_g$), which is its actual speed, is given by the derivative of energy with respect to momentum:\n\n$v = \\frac{dE}{dp}$\n\nFor small uncertainties, we can approximate this relationship as:\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta p_x} \\approx v$\n\nRearranging this gives us the formula for the uncertainty in energy:\n\n$\\Delta E \\approx v \\cdot \\Delta p_x$\n\n**3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the provided answers and identifying the most accurate approach.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principles:** The problem asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) given an uncertainty in position (Δx) and a velocity (v). This requires two key concepts from quantum mechanics and relativity:\n    *   **Heisenberg's Position-Momentum Uncertainty Principle:** This principle provides the fundamental link between the uncertainty in a particle's position and the uncertainty in its momentum.\n    *   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** This principle relates a particle's energy to its momentum. Since the electron's speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, the relativistic version of this relationship is required.\n\n2.  **Apply the Uncertainty Principle:** The most precise form of the position-momentum uncertainty principle is:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where Δp is the uncertainty in momentum and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n    To find the *minimum* uncertainty in momentum (Δp_min), we use the equality:\n    Δp_min = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n3.  **Relate Momentum Uncertainty to Energy Uncertainty:** The relationship between a small change in energy (dE) and a small change in momentum (dp) is given by the particle's group velocity, which is its classical velocity (v).\n    dE/dp = v\n    This relationship, `dE = v ⋅ dp`, holds true for both classical and relativistic particles, as correctly identified by most of the provided answers. For small uncertainties, we can approximate this as:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n4.  **Combine the Principles:** By substituting the expression for the minimum momentum uncertainty (from Step 2) into the energy-momentum uncertainty relation (from Step 3), we get a direct formula for the minimum energy uncertainty:\n    ΔE_min = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativistic Speed:** The electron's speed (v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s) is two-thirds the speed of light. This confirms that using the general relation `ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp` (which is valid for relativistic particles) is the correct approach, rather than relying on the non-relativistic kinetic energy formula `E = p²/2m`.\n*   **Minimum Uncertainty:** The question specifically asks for the *minimum* uncertainty, which justifies using the equality in the Heisenberg principle (`ħ/2`) rather than a broader order-of-magnitude approximation (like `ħ`).\n*   **Unit Consistency:** All calculations must use standard SI units. The uncertainty in position, Δx = 0.1 nm, must be converted to meters:\n    Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\n### Calculation\n\nUsing the combined formula and the given values:\n*   v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   Δx = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\nΔE_min = (2 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ ( (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m) )\n\nThe factor of '2' in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\nΔE_min = (10⁸) ⋅ ( (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴) / (10⁻¹⁰) ) J\nΔE_min = 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴⁺⁸⁺¹⁰ J\nΔE_min = 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is **1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J**.
