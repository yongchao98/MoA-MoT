    Checks the correctness of the provided LLM answer for the Cope rearrangement question.

    # The 1,5-diene system for rearrangement involves carbons 2 through 7 (IUPAC numbering).
    # System: C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7
    #
    # Rules of the Cope Rearrangement:
    # 1. Break the sigma bond between the two central carbons of the system (C4-C5).
    # 2. Form a new sigma bond between the two terminal carbons of the system (C2-C7).
    # 3. Shift the pi bonds: The C2=C3 bond moves to C3=C4, and the C6=C7 bond moves to C5=C6.
    
    # Let's trace the new structure and determine its IUPAC name.
    # The new skeleton is formed by the rearranged C2-C7 system with its substituents.
    # The substituents (methyl on C2, butyl on C5, ethyl on C7) remain on their respective carbons.
    # The new structure's connectivity is: CH2=CH-CH(Methyl)-CH(Ethyl)-CH=C(Butyl)
    #
    # To name this, we find the longest carbon chain that includes both double bonds.
    # The chain is: CH2=CH-CH-CH-CH=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. This is a 10-carbon chain (deca-).
    # Numbering from the CH2= end gives the double bonds the lowest locants (1 and 5).
    # The parent name is deca-1,5-diene.
    #
    # The substituents are located on this new 10-carbon chain:
    # - The methyl group is on carbon 3.
    # - The ethyl group is on carbon 4.

    # Assembling the name alphabetically gives: 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.
