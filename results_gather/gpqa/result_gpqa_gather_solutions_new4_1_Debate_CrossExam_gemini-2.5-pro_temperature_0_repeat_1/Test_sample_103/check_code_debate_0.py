    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided answers and identifying key points.

    ### Step 1: Relate the Observable to a Physical Quantity

    The problem provides the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) for each star, which is the observable quantity in the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This shift is a direct result of the star's motion due to the planet's gravity, as described by the Doppler effect.

    *   **Careful Point:** The amplitude of the star's radial velocity, known as the semi-amplitude (K), is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).

    Therefore, we can establish the ratio of the semi-amplitudes of the two stars from the ratio of their wavelength shifts:
    *   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 miliangstrom / 7 miliangstrom = 5/7

    ### Step 2: Use the Governing Formula for Radial Velocity

    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:

    K ≈ [ (2πG) / P ]^(1/3) * [ mₚ * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3) ]

    Where:
    *   P = Orbital Period
    *   mₚ = Planet's mass
    *   M_star = Star's mass
    *   i = Orbital inclination (angle to our line of sight)
    *   G = Gravitational constant

    ### Step 3: Apply Problem Constraints and Necessary Assumptions

    We can simplify the relationship between K and P by considering the given information and making standard assumptions.

    *   **Given:** The stars have "exactly the same masses" (M_star₁ = M_star₂).
    *   **Given:** The planets have "masses similar to that of Neptune" (m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂).
    *   **Careful Point (Assumption):** The orbital inclination `i` is unknown for both systems. For the problem to have a single, solvable answer among the choices, we must assume the inclinations are similar (i₁ ≈ i₂), and therefore sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂). This is a standard assumption in comparative exoplanet problems unless stated otherwise.

    With these conditions, the term `(2πG)^(1/3) * (mₚ * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))` becomes a constant for both systems. This leaves a simple proportionality between the semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P):

    K ∝ P^(-1/3)

    ### Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods

    Using the proportionality from Step 3, we can set up a ratio for the two planetary systems:

    K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)

    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (P₂ / P₁). We can solve for this by cubing both sides of the equation:

    P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³

    Now, we substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes we found in Step 1:

    P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³
    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644

    ### Conclusion

    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This result is physically intuitive: Star #2 has a larger velocity wobble (K₂ > K₁), which for identical masses implies its planet is closer and thus has a shorter orbital period (P₂ < P₁).

    Comparing our result to the given options:
    A) ~ 1.96
    B) ~ 0.85
    C) ~ 0.36
    D) ~ 1.40

    The calculated value of ~0.36 matches option C.
