    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering all the careful points from the provided candidate answers.

    ### **Analysis of Reaction 1: Formation of Product A**

    1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The starting material is `1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol`. This structure contains a 1,5-diene system with a hydroxyl group at the C3 position (`C=C-C(OH)-C-C=C`). The presence of a strong base (KH, potassium hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H+) is the classic condition for an **anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement**.

    2.  **Step-by-Step Mechanism:**
        *   **Deprotonation:** The strong base KH deprotonates the alcohol (-OH) to form a potassium alkoxide (-O⁻K⁺). This is the "anionic" part, which dramatically accelerates the rearrangement compared to the neutral (thermal) version.
        *   **-Sigmatropic Rearrangement:** The resulting alkoxide undergoes a concerted pericyclic rearrangement. The bond between the spiro carbon and the carbon bearing the alkoxide breaks, relieving the strain of the four-membered ring. Simultaneously, a new carbon-carbon bond forms between the terminal carbon of the vinyl group and a carbon of the double bond in the six-membered ring.
        *   **Intermediate and Tautomerization:** This rearrangement forms a bicyclic enolate intermediate. The final acidic workup (H+) protonates this enolate, which then rapidly tautomerizes to the more stable ketone.

    3.  **Determine the Product Structure (A):**
        *   The rearrangement of the spiro[3.5] system into a bridged bicyclic system is a known transformation. Tracing the carbon connectivity reveals the formation of a **bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane** skeleton.
        *   The molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₁H₁₆O. The product must be an isomer. The formula for `(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one` is also C₁₁H₁₆O, making it a plausible product.
        *   The alternative product, `decahydro-7H-benzo[7]annulen-7-one`, has a molecular formula of C₁₁H₁₈O. Since this is not an isomer of the starting material, it cannot be the correct product.
        *   Therefore, **Product A is (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.

    ### **Analysis of Reaction 2: Formation of Product B**

    1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The reaction involves an allylic alcohol (`(E)-pent-2-en-1-ol`), an acylating agent (`acetyl bromide`), and a strong, bulky base (`LDA`, lithium diisopropylamide). This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Ireland-Claisen rearrangement**.

    2.  **Step-by-Step Mechanism:**
        *   **Ester Formation:** The allylic alcohol is first converted into an allylic ester *in situ*. LDA deprotonates the alcohol, and the resulting lithium alkoxide attacks acetyl bromide.
        *   **Enolate Formation:** A second equivalent of LDA deprotonates the α-carbon of the ester's acetyl group, forming a key lithium enolate intermediate.
        *   **-Sigmatropic Rearrangement:** This enolate undergoes a concerted-sigmatropic rearrangement, forming a new C-C bond and cleaving the ester's C-O bond.

    3.  **Determine the Product Structure (B):**
        *   The rearrangement directly yields a γ,δ-unsaturated carboxylate.
        *   **Crucial Point:** The reaction is performed with a lithium base (LDA), and the problem does not specify a final acidic workup step for this reaction. Therefore, the carboxylic acid product remains in its deprotonated form as a lithium salt.
        *   The resulting structure is the lithium salt of 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid.
        *   Therefore, **Product B is lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.

    ### **Conclusion**

    Based on the detailed analysis of both reaction mechanisms:
    *   **Product A** is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.
    *   **Product B** is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.
