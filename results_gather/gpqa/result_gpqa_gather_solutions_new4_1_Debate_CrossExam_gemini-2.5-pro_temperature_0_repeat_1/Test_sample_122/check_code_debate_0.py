    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the special relativity problem.

    The problem involves calculating the distance traveled by a supernova ejecta
    in the Galaxy's reference frame, given the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame.
    This requires using the time dilation formula from special relativity.

    The steps are:
    1. Define the given physical constants and values.
    2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma).
    3. Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (dilated time).
    4. Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame.
    5. Compare the calculated distance with the options to find the closest one.
    6. Verify if the LLM's chosen answer matches the closest option.
