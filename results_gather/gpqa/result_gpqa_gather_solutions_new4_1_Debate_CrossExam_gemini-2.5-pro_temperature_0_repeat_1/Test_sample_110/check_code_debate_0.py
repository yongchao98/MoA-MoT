def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the selected answer for the given chemistry question.
    It analyzes both reactions to determine the correct products and their IUPAC names,
    then compares them against the names provided in the chosen option.

    # --- Step 1: Analyze Reaction A to determine the correct product name ---
    # Reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)
    # This is a Michael addition. The base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the ketone.
    # The ketone has two alpha-carbons: C2 and C6.
    # C2 is quaternary and has no alpha-protons.
    # C6 is tertiary and has one alpha-proton.
    # Therefore, deprotonation occurs exclusively at C6.
    # The C6 enolate attacks the beta-carbon of ethyl acrylate.
    # To name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate (as per the options),
    # the cyclohexyl ring is the substituent. Numbering of the substituent ring
    # starts at the point of attachment (the original C6).
    # - New C1 (old C6): has a methyl group.
    # - New C2 (old C1): has the oxo group.
    # - New C3 (old C2): has an ethyl and a methyl group.
    # The substituent name is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).
    correct_product_A = "ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate"

    # --- Step 2: Analyze Reaction B to determine the correct product name ---
    # Reaction: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)
    # This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon
    # alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane.
    # This carbanion attacks the beta-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.
    # The resulting structure is CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN.
    # To name this, the nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group (C1).
    # The longest carbon chain including C1 has 6 carbons (hexanenitrile).
    # Numbering from C1:
    # CN(1)-CH2(2)-CH(CH3)(3)-CH(NO2)(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)
    # The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.
