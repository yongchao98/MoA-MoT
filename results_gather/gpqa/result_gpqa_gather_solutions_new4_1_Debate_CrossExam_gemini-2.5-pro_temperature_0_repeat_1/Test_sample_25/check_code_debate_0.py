    # The product, 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one, is formed from cyclohexene and I₂C=C=O.

    # - 3 (cyclopenta-1,3-diene): Locked in s-cis conformation. Most reactive.
    # - 1 (2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene): Highly activated by internal EDGs, s-cis is easy. Very reactive.
    # - 2 ((2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene): Activated by terminal EDGs. Less reactive than 1.
    # - 4 ((2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene): Severe steric hindrance prevents s-cis conformation. Least reactive.
    # The correct order from most to least reactive is 3 > 1 > 2 > 4.
