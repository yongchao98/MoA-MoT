    # Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4
    # Reaction: Nitration of benzene.
    # Product: Nitrobenzene.
    product_1 = "nitrobenzene"
    
    # Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder
    # Reaction: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination) on nitrobenzene.
    # Directing Effect: The nitro group (-NO2) is a deactivating, meta-director.
    # Outcome: Bromine adds to the 3-position relative to the nitro group.
    product_2 = "1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene"
    
    # Step 3: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere
    # Reaction: Catalytic Hydrogenation.
    # Selectivity: H2/Pd-C is a standard method to selectively reduce a nitro group (-NO2)
    # to an amino group (-NH2) without affecting an aryl-halide bond under these conditions.
    product_3 = "3-bromoaniline"
    
    # Step 4: Product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4
    # Reaction: Diazotization of a primary aromatic amine.
    # Outcome: The amino group (-NH2) is converted to a diazonium salt.
    product_4 = "3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate"
    
    # Step 5: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole
    # Reaction: Gomberg-Bachmann reaction. The presence of anisole (another aromatic ring)
    # during heating indicates a coupling reaction, not a Schiemann reaction (which would yield a fluorobenzene).
    # Mechanism: The diazonium salt decomposes to a 3-bromophenyl radical.
    # Directing Effect: Anisole's methoxy group (-OCH3) is an ortho, para-director.
    # Regioselectivity: Due to steric hindrance, the incoming radical preferentially attacks the para-position.
    # Final Product Name: 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl
