    This function checks the correctness of the answer to a biology question
    by simulating the described experiment.

    The experiment involves:
    - Injecting iPSCs into a blastocyst.
    - iPSCs have a red label (mRaspberry) under a LINEAGE-SPECIFIC promoter.
    - Apoptosis is marked with a green label (TUNEL).
    - The question asks for the "first thing you notice" (at t=12h).

    The provided answer to check is 'A': "green signal colocalizes with the red signal".
