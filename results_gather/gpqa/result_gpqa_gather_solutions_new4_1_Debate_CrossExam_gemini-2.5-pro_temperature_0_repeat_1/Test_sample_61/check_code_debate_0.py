    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the organic synthesis question.

    The question asks for the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize
    1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.

    The analysis proceeds as follows:
    1.  The target product is identified as the self-aldol addition product of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
    2.  Therefore, the synthetic strategy must first convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
    3.  Each option is evaluated step-by-step to see if it follows this strategy.

    # Option A Analysis
    # 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: Ethynylcyclohexane -> 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne. (Correct alkylation)
    # 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne -> cis-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene. (Correct partial reduction)
    # 3. O3/(CH3)2S: cis-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene -> cyclohexanecarbaldehyde + acetaldehyde. (Correct reductive ozonolysis, produces key intermediate)

    # 1. NaNH2, methanol: NaNH2 is a strong base, methanol is a protic solvent. They react in an acid-base reaction, preventing the desired alkylation.

        "is_correct": False,
        "reason": "The synthesis fails at step 1. The strong base NaNH2 would be quenched by the acidic proton of methanol, preventing the deprotonation and subsequent alkylation of the alkyne."

    # 2. H2/Pd: This is a catalyst for complete hydrogenation. It would reduce the alkyne from step 1 all the way to an unreactive alkane (propylcyclohexane), which is a dead end.
    analysis['C'] = {

        "reason": "The synthesis fails at step 2. H2/Pd would fully reduce the alkyne to an alkane, which cannot be converted to the target product with the subsequent reagents."
