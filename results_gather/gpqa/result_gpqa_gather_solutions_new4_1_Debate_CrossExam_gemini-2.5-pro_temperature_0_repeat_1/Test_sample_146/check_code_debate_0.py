    # --- Step-by-step Calculation based on Physics Principles ---

    # 1. Calculate the total initial energy (E_initial).
    # The problem states the antiproton is "slowly moving", which implies its kinetic energy
    # is negligible. We assume the annihilation happens from a state of rest.
    # E_initial = rest energy of proton + rest energy of antiproton.
    # The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical.
    e_initial = 2 * m_p_c2

    # 2. Set up the final energy equation (E_final).
    # The final state has 4 particles of type A. By conservation of momentum (from an initial
    # zero-momentum state), the energy is distributed equally among the four particles.
    # This means they all have the same speed 'v' and thus the same Lorentz factor 'gamma'.
    # E_final = 4 * (total energy of one A particle) = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2

    # 3. Apply conservation of energy: E_initial = E_final
    # 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2
    # We can solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma.
    gamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)
    # Simplified: gamma = m_p_c2 / (2 * m_A_c2)

    # 4. Check for physical possibility.
    # The total rest mass of the final particles cannot exceed the initial energy.
    # Total final rest mass energy = 4 * m_A_c2 = 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV.
    # Initial energy = 1876.54 MeV.
    # Since 1200 < 1876.54, the process is possible and the final particles will have kinetic energy.
    # This also means gamma must be greater than 1.
    if gamma <= 1:
        return f"Calculation error: Lorentz factor gamma is {gamma:.4f}, which is not greater than 1. This implies the final rest mass is greater than or equal to the initial energy, which contradicts the problem setup."

    # 5. Calculate the velocity 'v' from the Lorentz factor 'gamma'.
    # The velocity is expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, beta = v/c.
    # The relationship is: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)
    # Rearranging for beta: beta = sqrt(1 - 1 / gamma^2)
    beta_squared = 1 - (1 / (gamma**2))
    calculated_beta = math.sqrt(beta_squared)

    # --- Verification ---
    # Check if the calculated beta value matches the value from the chosen option 'C'.
    # The options are given to two decimal places, so we check if our calculated value
    # rounds to the answer's value.
    # A tolerance of 0.005 is appropriate for checking rounding to two decimal places.
