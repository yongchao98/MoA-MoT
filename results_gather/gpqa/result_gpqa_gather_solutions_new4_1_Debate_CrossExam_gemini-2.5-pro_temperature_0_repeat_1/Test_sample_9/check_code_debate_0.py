    Checks the correctness of the answer to the exoplanet density question.

    The core principle is that for planets of the same composition, density increases
    with mass due to gravitational compression. This can be modeled with a mass-radius
    relationship R ~ M^k, which leads to a mass-density relationship rho ~ M^(1-3k).
