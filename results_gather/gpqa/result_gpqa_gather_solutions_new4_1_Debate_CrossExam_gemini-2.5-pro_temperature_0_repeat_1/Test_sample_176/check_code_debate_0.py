    Checks the correctness of the calculated luminosity ratio for the two stars.

    v2 = 700.0
    # Speed of light in km/s (using a precise value)
    c = 299792.458

    # --- Step 1: Formulate the luminosity ratio ---
    # From the Stefan-Boltzmann Law (L = 4πR²σT⁴), the ratio is:
    # L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴
    # The radius component is straightforward:
    radius_component = radius_ratio**2

    # --- Step 2: Determine the temperature ratio (T1/T2) ---
    # This requires accounting for the Doppler effect.
    # The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.
    #
    # For Star 1 (v1 = 0), there is no Doppler shift: λ_obs1 = λ_emitted1.
    # For Star 2 (v2 = 700 km/s), its light is redshifted (assuming receding velocity):
    # λ_obs2 = λ_emitted2 * (1 + v2/c)  (using the non-relativistic approximation, which is sufficient here)
    #
    # Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we have: λ_emitted1 = λ_emitted2 * (1 + v2/c).
    #
    # From Wien's Law (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted), the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio:
    # T1/T2 = λ_emitted2 / λ_emitted1
    #
    # Substituting the relationship from the Doppler effect:
    # T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)
