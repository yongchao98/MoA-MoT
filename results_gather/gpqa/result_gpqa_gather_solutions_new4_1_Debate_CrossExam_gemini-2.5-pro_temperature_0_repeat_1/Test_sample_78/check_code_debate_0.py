    Checks the correctness of the answer by verifying the logical steps and constraints.
    
    The core logic of the provided answer is:
    1. The product is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one, which contains a p-tolyl group.
    2. The reaction is an isomerization, so the starting material must also be C11H12O.
    3. The p-tolyl group is conserved, so the starting material must also contain it.
    4. Only option D fits these criteria.
    
    This code checks each of these points.
