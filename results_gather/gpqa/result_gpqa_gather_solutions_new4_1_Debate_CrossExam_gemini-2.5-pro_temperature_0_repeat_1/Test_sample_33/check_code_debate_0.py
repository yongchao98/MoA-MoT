    # Reaction A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol
    # 1. Carbocation Stability: The carbocation at C4 is tertiary and benzylic, which is more stable than the tertiary carbocation at C3.
    # 2. Migratory Aptitude: The groups on the adjacent C3 are methyl and ethyl. Ethyl has a higher migratory aptitude than methyl.
    # 3. Product: Ethyl migrates from C3 to C4. The ketone forms at C3.

    # Reaction B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol
    # 1. Carbocation Stability: The carbocation at C3 is stabilized by a 4-hydroxyphenyl group (a strong electron-donating group), making it more stable than the carbocation at C2, which is stabilized by a simple phenyl group.
    # 2. Migratory Aptitude: The groups on the adjacent C2 are phenyl and methyl. Phenyl has a much higher migratory aptitude than methyl.
    # 3. Product: Phenyl migrates from C2 to C3. The ketone forms at C2.

    # Reaction C: 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1,2-diol
    # 1. Carbocation Stability: The carbocation at C1 is stabilized by two 4-methoxyphenyl groups (strong electron-donating groups). This is more stable than the carbocation at C2, which is stabilized by one 4-methoxyphenyl and one phenyl group.
    # 2. Migratory Aptitude: The groups on the adjacent C2 are 4-methoxyphenyl and phenyl. The 4-methoxyphenyl group has a higher migratory aptitude due to its electron-donating methoxy group.
    # 3. Product: The 4-methoxyphenyl group migrates from C2 to C1. The ketone forms at C2, attached to the phenyl group.
