    1. The difference in the MFP formula for gas-gas vs. electron-gas collisions.
    2. The relationship between the collision cross-sections for the two cases.

    # --- Step 1: Define the physical principles and formulas ---

    # The ratio of the two mean free paths is derived as:
    # λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg
    # where:
    #   - σ_gg is the kinetic cross-section for a gas-gas collision.
    #   - σ_eg is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron-gas collision.

    # --- Step 2: Codify the critical physical insight ---

    # The question specifies a very high accelerating voltage (1000 kV).
    # For such high-energy, penetrating electrons, the atom is mostly "empty space".
    # Therefore, the electron-gas scattering cross-section (σ_eg) is significantly
    # SMALLER than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (σ_gg).
    # This means the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) must be a value greater than 1.
    # We can represent this relationship without needing exact values.
    # Let's assume a plausible ratio for the sake of calculation, e.g., σ_gg is 5 times σ_eg.
    # The core logic only requires this ratio to be > 1.
    cross_section_ratio = 5.0  # Represents σ_gg / σ_eg

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the theoretical ratio of the mean free paths ---

    # The minimum possible value for the MFP ratio occurs as the cross_section_ratio
    # approaches 1 from above. Therefore, λ2/λ1 must be greater than √2.
    min_mfp_ratio = math.sqrt(2)  # Approximately 1.414

    # Using our assumed plausible value for a more concrete result:
    mfp_ratio = math.sqrt(2) * cross_section_ratio  # λ2 / λ1

    # --- Step 4: Evaluate the given options based on the derived physics ---
    # The derived conclusion is that λ2 / λ1 > √2 ≈ 1.414.

    # Option A: λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1  =>  1 < (λ2/λ1) < 1.22
    # This is FALSE because our ratio must be > 1.414.

            f"1. The formula for the mean free path (MFP) of a gas molecule among its peers is λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg), where the √2 factor accounts for relative motion.\n"
            f"2. The MFP for a high-speed electron hitting stationary gas molecules is λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg). The √2 factor is absent.\n"
            f"3. The ratio is therefore λ2/λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg.\n"
            f"4. The critical constraint is that for very high-energy (1000 kV) electrons, the scattering cross-section (σ_eg) is much SMALLER than the kinetic cross-section of the gas molecules (σ_gg). This means the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is > 1.\n"
            f"5. Consequently, the ratio of the mean free paths λ2/λ1 must be greater than √2 (approx. 1.414).\n"
            f"6. Option B (λ2 >= 1.22*λ1) is the only choice consistent with the conclusion that λ2/λ1 > 1.414."
