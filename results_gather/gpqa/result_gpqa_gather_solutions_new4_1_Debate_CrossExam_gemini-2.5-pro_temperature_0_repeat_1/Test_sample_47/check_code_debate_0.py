Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.

### Step 1: Determine the Reaction Sequence and Final Product

All candidate answers that provide a detailed chemical analysis agree on the four-step reaction sequence. This consensus strongly indicates the correct pathway.

1.  **Cyclohexanone + Bromine → Product 1:** This is an alpha-bromination of a ketone. The product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.
2.  **Product 1 + NaOH (heat) → Product 2:** This is a classic Favorskii rearrangement of an α-halo ketone. The reaction involves a ring contraction of the six-membered ring to a five-membered ring, forming a carboxylic acid. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.
3.  **Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂) → Product 3:** This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride. The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.
4.  **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4:** This reagent is a mild, selective reducing agent that reduces an acyl chloride to an aldehyde. The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.

### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of Product 4 for Chemically Distinct Hydrogens

The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. The task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, which corresponds to the number of signals expected in a ¹H NMR spectrum.

*   **Structure:** A five-membered cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).
*   **Symmetry:** We must analyze the molecule's symmetry. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C-H and C=O bonds), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the ring.
*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogen Environments:**
    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The single hydrogen of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** distinct type.
    2.  **The C1 Proton:** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. This is a **2nd** distinct type.
    3.  **The C2/C5 Protons:** Due to the plane of symmetry, carbon C2 is equivalent to carbon C5. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are **diastereotopic** because C1 is a stereocenter. This means they are in different chemical environments. By symmetry, the "upper" proton on C2 is equivalent to the "upper" proton on C5, and the "lower" proton on C2 is equivalent to the "lower" proton on C5. This gives **2** more distinct types of hydrogens.
    4.  **The C3/C4 Protons:** Similarly, carbon C3 is equivalent to carbon C4. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. This gives another **2** distinct types of hydrogens.

*   **Total Count:** Summing the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.

### Step 3: Compare with Candidate Answers and Decide

The correct number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 6. The options are:
A) 7
B) 6
C) 8
D) 10

The correct option is B.

*   Most of the candidate answers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17) correctly deduce the structure and correctly reason that there are 6 distinct hydrogen atoms.
*   However, only **Answer 5** correctly pairs this reasoning with the final answer choice <<<B>>>. Many other answers have correct reasoning but select an incorrect letter (e.g., Answer 1 selects C, Answer 2 selects D, etc.), indicating a mismatch between their analysis and their final choice.
*   Answer 12 arrives at the wrong number of hydrogens (10) in its reasoning but happens to select the correct final letter <<<B>>>. Its reasoning is flawed because it incorrectly assumes the absence of any symmetry.

Based on the overwhelming consensus in the chemical reasoning and identifying the only answer where the reasoning correctly matches the selected option, the final answer is 6.

<<<B>>>
