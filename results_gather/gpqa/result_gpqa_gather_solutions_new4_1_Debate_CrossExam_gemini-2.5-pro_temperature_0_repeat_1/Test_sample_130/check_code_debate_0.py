def check_diels_alder_noesy():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to a chemistry problem
    involving a Diels-Alder reaction and NOESY NMR analysis.

    The logic is based on the following chemical principles:
    1.  **Reactant Identification:** The reactants are correctly identified as maleic anhydride
        and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.
    2.  **Major Product Stereochemistry:** The diene is exceptionally bulky due to four
        methyl groups. This severe steric hindrance is known to override the typical
        electronic preference of the "endo rule". Therefore, the major product formed
        under kinetic control is the less sterically hindered 'exo' adduct.
    3.  **NOESY Analysis:** A NOESY cross-peak indicates spatial proximity (< 5 Ã…).
        The question asks for a cross-peak present in the major product but absent
        in the minor product.
        -   In the **major ('exo') product**, the anhydride protons are on the same
            face of the bicyclic system as the vinylic methyl groups. They are close.
        -   In the **minor ('endo') product**, these protons are on opposite faces
            and are far apart.
    4.  **Signal Assignment:**
        -   The anhydride protons correspond to the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.
        -   The vinylic methyl protons correspond to the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.
    5.  **Conclusion:** The distinguishing cross-peak connects the signals for the
        anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons. This corresponds to option A.

                  f"1.  **Major Product:** Due to severe steric hindrance from the four methyl groups on the diene, the major product is the 'exo' adduct, not the 'endo' adduct as predicted by the simple endo rule.\n"
                  f"2.  **Spatial Proximity in 'Exo' Adduct:** In the 'exo' structure, the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are on the same face of the molecule as the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm), making them spatially close.\n"
                  f"3.  **Distinguishing NOESY Peak:** This proximity is absent in the minor 'endo' product. Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak connecting these two groups is the one that is present in the major product but absent in the minor one.\n"
                  f"4.  **Conclusion:** The cross-peak connects the '6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm' and the '2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', which corresponds to option {derived_correct_option}.")
