Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let the velocities of the two astronauts be v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. The formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) is:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).

Relative Speed Calculation\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let the velocities of the two astronauts be v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c in the positive x-direction. The relative velocity of the second astronaut with respect to the first is given by:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Total Energy Calculation\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic object is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). We need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and then add them together.\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\nγ1 = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\nγ1 = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\nγ1 = 1 / √0.64\nγ1 = 1 / 0.8\nγ1 = 1.25\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E1):\nE1 = γ1 * (2m) * c²\nE1 = 1.25 * 2mc²\nE1 = 2.5 mc²\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\nγ2 = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\nγ2 = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\nγ2 = 1 / √0.75\nγ2 = 1 / (√3 / 2)\nγ2 = 2 / √3\nγ2 ≈ 1.1547\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E2):\nE2 = γ2 * (3m) * c²\nE2 = (2 / √3) * 3mc²\nE2 = 2√3 mc²\nE2 ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the individual energies:\nE_total = E1 + E2\nE_total = 2.5 mc² + 2√3 mc²\nE_total = (2.5 + 2√3) mc²\nE_total ≈ (2.5 + 3.464) mc²\nE_total ≈ 5.964 mc²\n\nSo, the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our calculated values with the given options:\n*   **Relative speed (v_rel) ≈ 0.14c**\n*   **Total energy (E) ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\nThese values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)\n\nSince the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find their relative speed. For two objects moving in the same direction (let's say the positive x-direction) with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ as measured from a stationary frame, the relative velocity of object 1 with respect to object 2 is given by:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2.

For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities u and v, the relative velocity is given by `v_rel = (v - u) / (1 - uv/c^2)`. The total relativistic energy of a system of non-interacting particles is the sum of their individual relativistic energies.

These values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nProposer: The problem requires us to calculate the relative speed and the total energy of a system of two astronauts with given masses and relativistic speeds. I'll start by finding the formula for the relativistic relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction.\n\nSkeptic: While finding the formula for relative speed is a good first step, we also need the formula for the total relativistic energy of a system of particles. Is the total energy simply the sum of the individual relativistic energies, or are there other factors to consider? We should look for both formulas to be efficient. Also, we need to be careful about the signs in the velocity-addition formula, as both astronauts are moving in the same direction.\n\nDecide: I will search for the formulas for both relativistic relative velocity and the total energy of a system of particles. This will ensure accuracy for both parts of the problem.Proposer: The search results confirm the necessary formulas. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities u and v, the relative velocity is given by `v_rel = (v - u) / (1 - uv/c^2)`. The total relativistic energy of a system of non-interacting particles is the sum of their individual relativistic energies. The relativistic energy for a single particle is `E = γmc^2`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`. I will now proceed with the calculations.\n\nSkeptic: The formulas seem correct. However, the calculation of `γ` (the Lorentz factor) and the subsequent energy calculations can be prone to arithmetic errors. It's crucial to perform these calculations carefully for each astronaut and then sum them. A small mistake in any of these steps will lead to an incorrect final answer.\n\nDecide: I have the correct and verified formulas. The next logical step is to substitute the given values into these formulas and calculate the relative speed and total energy. I will perform the calculations in a step-by-step manner to minimize the risk of errors.Proposer: I have all the necessary information and formulas. I will now perform the final calculations for both the relative speed and the total energy to determine the correct option.\n\n**1.
