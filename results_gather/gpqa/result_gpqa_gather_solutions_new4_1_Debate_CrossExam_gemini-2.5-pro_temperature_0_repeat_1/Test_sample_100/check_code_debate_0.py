    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to an organic chemistry question.

    The question asks to identify the correct reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the synthesis of
    1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine from 3-methylpyrrolidine.

    The reaction is:
    3-methylpyrrolidine + A --(B, Heat, solvent)--> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine

    The options are:
    A) A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid
    B) A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid
    C) A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH
    D) A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH

    The provided answer to check is 'C'.

    # Constraint 1: Identify the reaction type and required reagent class for A.
    # The reactant '3-methylpyrrolidine' is a secondary amine.
    # The product '1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine' contains an N-C=C bond system, which is an enamine.
    # The synthesis of an enamine from a secondary amine requires a carbonyl compound (an aldehyde or a ketone).
    # By performing a retrosynthesis on the product, the carbonyl compound is identified as cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

    # Constraint 2: Identify the most suitable catalyst B.
    # The reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration (condensation). The "Heat" condition suggests driving off water.
    # Both Acetic acid (weak) and TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid, strong) are acids.
    # For dehydration reactions, a strong acid catalyst like TsOH is generally more effective and a standard choice in synthetic chemistry compared to a weak acid.
