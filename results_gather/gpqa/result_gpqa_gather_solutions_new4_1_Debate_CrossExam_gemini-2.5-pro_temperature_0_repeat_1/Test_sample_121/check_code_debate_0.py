    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.

    ### Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1
    *   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.
    *   **Analysis:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, a reaction known as the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction or a close variant. The reaction brominates the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the carboxyl group.
    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).

    ### Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2
    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).
    *   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.
    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).

    ### Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3
    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).
    *   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion, which is a good leaving group.
    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).

    ### Step 4: Determine the structure of the final Product 4
    *   **Reaction:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.
    *   **Analysis:** This is the most complex step.
        1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. These protons are acidic because the carbon is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a nitrile -CN and an ester -COOEt). This creates a stabilized carbanion (an enolate).
        2.  The enolate attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an intermolecular Sₙ2 reaction.
        3.  The problem states that *excess* NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon of the intermediate formed in the previous step.
        4.  The resulting carbanion then undergoes a rapid *intramolecular* Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain to displace the second bromide ion. This type of reaction, which forms a ring, is known as the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.
        5.  The ring will contain the α-carbon from ethyl cyanoacetate and the five carbons from the 1,5-dibromopentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.
    *   **Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.

    ### Step 5: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4
    *   **Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1).
    *   **Symmetry and Chemical Equivalence:** To count the number of distinct signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping, which creates a time-averaged structure. In this averaged structure, the molecule can be considered to have a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C4, and the two substituents on C1.
        *   This symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6.
        *   It also makes the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.
    *   **Diastereotopicity:** A key concept in the NMR of substituted rings is that the two protons on a single methylene (CH₂) group (the axial and equatorial protons) are in different chemical environments and are thus not equivalent. They are diastereotopic and will give separate signals.
    *   **Counting the Signals:**
        1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**
            *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.
            *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are equivalent to each other (enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry). This gives **1 signal**.
        2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**
            *   **C2 and C6 Protons (4H total):** The axial protons on C2 and C6 are equivalent to each other. The equatorial protons on C2 and C6 are equivalent to each other. However, the axial and equatorial protons are distinct. This results in **2 signals**.
            *   **C3 and C5 Protons (4H total):** By the same logic, the four protons on these carbons give rise to **2 signals**.
            *   **C4 Protons (2H total):** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic (axial and equatorial) and are not equivalent to any other protons. This gives **2 signals**.
    *   **Total Signal Count:**
        *   Summing the signals: 1 (ethyl CH₃) + 1 (ethyl CH₂) + 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.

    This corresponds to option A.
