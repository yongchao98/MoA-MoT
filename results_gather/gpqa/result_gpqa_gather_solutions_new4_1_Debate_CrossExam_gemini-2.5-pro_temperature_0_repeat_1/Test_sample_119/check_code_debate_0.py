    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, followed by the final answer.

    ### Step-by-Step Analysis

    The problem asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`plx`) and the parallax itself, under the assumption that stars are uniformly distributed in space. Let's denote the number of stars as `N`. The quantity we are looking for is `dN/d(plx)`.

    1.  **Fundamental Assumptions:**
        *   **Uniform Star Distribution:** The number of stars per unit volume, known as the number density (`ρ`), is constant everywhere.
        *   **Parallax-Distance Relation:** The parallax of a star (`plx`) is inversely proportional to its distance (`d`). The relationship is `d = 1/plx` (using appropriate units where the constant of proportionality is 1).

    2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:**
        Consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer. Let the shell's radius be `d` and its thickness be `dd`.
        *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).
            `dV = 4πd² dd`
        *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this volume is the density multiplied by the volume:
            `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`

    3.  **Converting from Distance to Parallax:**
        The expression for `dN` is in terms of distance (`d` and `dd`). To answer the question, we must convert it into terms of parallax (`plx` and `d(plx)`).
        *   First, substitute `d = 1/plx` into the equation:
            `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * dd = (4πρ / plx²) * dd`
        *   Next, we must relate the differential thickness `dd` to the differential parallax `d(plx)`. We do this by differentiating the distance-parallax relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:
            `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`
        *   This gives us `dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)`.

    4.  **Final Derivation:**
        Now we substitute the expression for `dd` back into our equation for `dN`.
        `dN = (4πρ / plx²) * [(-1/plx²) d(plx)]`
        `dN = (-4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`

        The question asks for the "number of stars per unit range of parallax," which is `dN/d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as parallax increases (distance decreases), the volume element at that corresponding distance shrinks. When counting stars, we are interested in the density or magnitude within a given range. Therefore, we consider the magnitude of the relationship:
        `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx⁴`

    5.  **Conclusion:**
        Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is directly proportional to `1/plx⁴`.
        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`

    ### Careful Points to Note

    *   **Cumulative vs. Differential:** A common mistake is to calculate the total number of stars `N` with a parallax greater than `plx`. This quantity, `N(>plx)`, is proportional to `d³`, which means `N(>plx) ∝ (1/plx)³ = 1/plx³`. This corresponds to option D. However, the question asks for the number of stars *per unit range* of parallax, which requires taking the derivative of the cumulative number, leading to the `1/plx⁴` relationship.
    *   **The Chain Rule:** The most critical step in the derivation is correctly relating the differential element `dd` to `d(plx)`. The derivative of `1/plx` is `-1/plx²`, which introduces an additional `plx²` term in the denominator.
    *   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** The provided candidate answers overwhelmingly perform the correct derivation, arriving at the `1/plx⁴` conclusion. However, many of them incorrectly map this result to the multiple-choice options. For example, Answer 2 correctly derives `1/plx⁴` but concludes `<<<D>>>` (`1/plx³`), and Answer 4 correctly derives `1/plx⁴` but concludes `<<<B>>>` (`1/plx²`). This highlights the importance of carefully matching the derived result to the given options. The correct derivation `... ∝ 1/plx⁴` corresponds to option C.

    Based on the rigorous derivation, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as `1/plx⁴`.
