    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the given organic chemistry question.

    The function verifies two key points:
    1.  For Reaction A, the Michael addition must occur at the C1 position of the 
        cyclohexanone ring, as this is the most acidic site.
    2.  For Reaction B, the product is a butanoate derivative, not a succinate,
        based on the Michael addition mechanism.
