Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question based on the provided candidate answers.

**1. Analyze the Context and the Key Phrase**
The conversation occurs between two synthetic organic chemists. This context is crucial, as their work heavily involves synthesizing molecules and then purifying them from reaction mixtures. The key phrase, "my compounds are on top of each other," is a colloquialism, or lab jargon, used to describe a problem. The consensus among the candidate answers is that this phrase refers to a failed separation.

**2. Identify the Relevant Laboratory Technique**
The vast majority of the provided answers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17) correctly identify that the phrase "on top of each other" is a visual metaphor that strongly points to **chromatography**, specifically Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography.
*   In TLC, compounds separate into distinct spots at different heights on a plate. If they don't separate, the spots overlap, literally appearing "on top of each other."
*   This phrasing is less commonly used for other techniques like distillation (where one might say compounds "co-distill") or recrystallization.

**3. Determine the Underlying Principle of the Technique**
The candidate answers unanimously agree that the primary principle governing separation in standard laboratory chromatography (using silica gel or alumina) is **polarity**.
*   The stationary phase (e.g., silica gel) is polar.
*   Polar compounds adhere more strongly to the stationary phase and move slowly.
*   Non-polar compounds are carried more quickly by the mobile phase (the solvent).
*   Separation is achieved because of the different rates of movement based on these different polar interactions.

**4. Connect the Problem to the Principle**
If two or more compounds in a mixture have very **similar polarities**, they will interact with the stationary and mobile phases in an almost identical way. This causes them to travel at the same rate during chromatography. The result is a failure to separate, which is what the chemist is lamenting. This is the logical conclusion reached by nearly every candidate answer that provided reasoning.

**5. Evaluate the Multiple-Choice Options**
Based on the analysis above, we can assess the options:

*   **A) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.** This is incorrect. Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is not the basis for separation in standard chromatography.
*   **B) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.** This would make separation by **distillation** difficult. However, the phrase "on top of each other" is characteristic jargon for chromatography, not distillation.
*   **C) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.** This statement is too general. While these forces are the fundamental basis for polarity, the direct operational problem is that the compounds' *overall polarities* are too similar for the technique to distinguish between them.
*   **D) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.** This is the most direct and accurate explanation. Similar polarities lead to a failed chromatographic separation, which is visually and colloquially described as the compounds being "on top of each other."

**Conclusion**
There is an overwhelming consensus in the reasoning of the candidate answers. The chemist's statement is a common way to describe a failed separation by chromatography, and the underlying chemical reason for this failure is that the compounds have similar polarities.
