def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the exoplanet temperature ratio problem.

    The core physics principles are:
    1. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) is proportional to the inverse square root of the distance from the star (d): T_eq ∝ d^(-1/2).
    2. Kepler's Third Law states that the orbital period squared (P^2) is proportional to the distance cubed (d^3): P^2 ∝ d^3, which means d ∝ P^(2/3).
    3. Combining these, we get T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3).
    4. Therefore, the ratio of temperatures is T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).
