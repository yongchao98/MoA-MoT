    Checks the correctness of the answer based on the principles of fluorescence and Stokes Shift.
    
    1. Calculates the wavelength of the emitted light from the given energy.
    2. Identifies the color of the emitted light.
    3. Applies the Stokes Shift principle: absorbed light must have a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than emitted light.
    4. Evaluates the given options to find all physically possible answers.
    5. Checks if the provided answer is not only possible but also the most plausible one.
