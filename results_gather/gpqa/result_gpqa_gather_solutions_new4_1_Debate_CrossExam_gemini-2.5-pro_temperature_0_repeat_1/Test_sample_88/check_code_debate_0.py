Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations and the resulting NMR spectrum.

### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**

1.  **Analysis of Reaction 1: Formation of Product 1**
    *   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.
    *   **Key Data:** The product (Product 1) has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a ketone. The ¹H NMR shows 14 protons, meaning the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.
    *   **Interpretation:** The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) on the rigid adamantane skeleton are known to induce skeletal rearrangements. A simple substitution or elimination is unlikely. The most chemically sound product that fits the data (a C₁₀H₁₄O ketone) and known chemistry is **protoadamantan-4-one**. The unusual NMR data provided in the prompt is likely a distractor or an erroneous simplification, a common feature in such problems.

2.  **Analysis of Reaction 2: Formation of Product 2**
    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide.
    *   **Key Information:** The next step is ozonolysis, which requires a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). Therefore, Product 2 must be an alkene.
    *   **Interpretation:** The reaction conditions combine two steps. First, aluminum isopropoxide performs a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, converting the ketone (Product 1) to an alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol). Second, the heat applied during the reaction causes the alcohol to dehydrate (lose a molecule of water), forming an alkene. The resulting alkene is **protoadamantene**.

3.  **Analysis of Reaction 3: Formation of Product 3**
    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamantene) is treated with ozone (O₃) and then dimethylsulfide (DMS).
    *   **Interpretation:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis. The reaction cleaves the C=C double bond. In protoadamantene, the double bond is between two tertiary carbons (carbons with no attached hydrogens). Cleavage of such a bond followed by reductive workup yields two ketone groups. The reaction opens one of the rings of the protoadamantane cage.
    *   **Structure of Product 3:** The final product is the highly symmetrical diketone, **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.

4.  **¹H NMR Analysis of Product 3**
    *   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding exchangeable ones)?
    *   **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione, the most deshielded protons are the two equivalent **bridgehead protons** at positions C1 and C5. They are beta to two electron-withdrawing ketone groups, and their position in the rigid cage enhances their deshielding.
    *   **Analyzing the Coupling (Splitting):** Let's focus on the proton at C1 (H1).
        *   H1 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent methylene (CH₂) groups at C2 and C8.
        *   The molecule has a high degree of symmetry (C₂ᵥ), meaning the environment around C2 is identical to that around C8.
        *   The two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other (one is axial, one is equatorial). The same is true for C8.
        *   Therefore, H1 is coupled to two equivalent axial protons (H2-ax and H8-ax) with a coupling constant Jₐₓ.
        *   H1 is also coupled to two equivalent equatorial protons (H2-eq and H8-eq) with a different coupling constant Jₑq.
        *   (Coupling to the C9 bridge protons is generally weaker and often not resolved).
    *   **Determining the Pattern:** Coupling to the two equivalent axial protons splits the H1 signal into a **triplet** (based on the n+1 rule, where n=2). Each of the three lines of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial protons into another **triplet**.
    *   **Final Pattern:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.
