    This function verifies the solution to the relativistic velocity addition problem.
    
    Problem details:
    - A light beam propagates through glass (refractive index n).
    - The glass moves at velocity v in the same direction as the beam.
    - The observer is in the laboratory frame.
    - The speed of light in vacuum is c=1.
    - Question: What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

    The solution uses the relativistic velocity addition formula:
    u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)
    where u' is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame (u' = c/n).
    """
    
    # 1. Define symbolic variables
    # n (refractive index) and v (velocity) are treated as positive real numbers.
    n, v = sympy.symbols('n v', real=True, positive=True)
    
    # 2. Define constants and known relationships from the problem
    c = 1  # Speed of light in vacuum is set to 1.
    u_prime = c / n  # Speed of light in the rest frame of the glass.
    
    # 3. Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula
    # u_derived is the speed of light as measured by the lab observer.
    # The formula is for collinear velocities (glass and light move in the same direction).
    u_derived = (u_prime + v) / (1 + u_prime * v / c**2)

    # So, we check against the expression for option A.
