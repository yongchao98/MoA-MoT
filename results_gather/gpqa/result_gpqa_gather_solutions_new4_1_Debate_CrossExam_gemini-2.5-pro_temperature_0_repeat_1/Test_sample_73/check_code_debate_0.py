def check_radioactive_decay_problem():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the radioactive decay problem.

    The problem states:
    - Decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%.
    - 50 minutes have passed without decay.
    - Question: What is the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes?

    The provided solution's logic is:
    1. The process is memoryless, so the 50 minutes passed are irrelevant.
    2. Survival probability for 100 min, S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.
    3. The required probability is the decay probability for 150 min, P(150).
    4. P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - S(100)^(150/100) = 1 - 0.68^1.5.
    5. The result is ~0.4393, which is closest to 44% (Option B).
    6. The final answer given is <<<B>>>.

    This function will re-calculate the result and verify if it matches the provided answer.
