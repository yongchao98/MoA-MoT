The search results confirm the methodology for calculating the partition function for a system of spins. The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors, e^(-βE), over all possible microstates of the system.\n\nThe steps are:\n1.  Identify all possible microstates of the system. For three spins (S1, S2, S3) that can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states.\n2.  Calculate the energy E for each microstate using the given Hamiltonian: E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n3.  Group the states by their energy level and determine the degeneracy (the number of states with the same energy).\n4.  Calculate the partition function Z by summing the term g * e^(-βE) for each energy level, where g is the degeneracy.\n\nMy calculation followed these steps precisely.\n\n*   **States with all spins parallel:**\n    *   (+, +, +): E = -J(1+1+1) = -3J\n    *   (-, -, -): E = -J(1+1+1) = -3J\n    *   These two states have an energy of -3J. The degeneracy is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **States with one spin flipped:**\n    *   (+, +, -): E = -J(1-1-1) = J\n    *   (+, -, +): E = -J(-1+1-1) = J\n    *   (-, +, +): E = -J(-1-1+1) = J\n    *   (+, -, -): E = -J(-1-1+1) = J\n    *   (-, +, -): E = -J(-1+1-1) = J\n    *   (-, -, +): E = -J(1-1-1) = J\n    *   These six states all have an energy of J. The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\n*   **Partition Function Z:**\n    *   Z = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\n    *   Z = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\n    *   Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis result matches option B. The search results, particularly those discussing the Ising model on a triangular lattice, confirm that systems with this type of interaction (three spins interacting in a triangle) have these two energy levels. For a ferromagnetic interaction (J>0), the ground state (lowest energy) is when all spins are aligned, and the next energy level occurs when one spin is flipped. My calculation is consistent with this.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta) - Incorrect energies and degeneracies.\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta) - Matches my calculation.\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta) - Incorrect energies.\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta) - Incorrect signs in the exponents.\n\nThe calculation is robust.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. The total number of possible configurations (microstates) for the system is 2x2x2 = 8.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT):\nZ = Σ_states * e^(-βE)\n\nWe must evaluate the energy for each of the 8 possible microstates:\n\n1.  **All spins are up:** (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n\n2.  **All spins are down:** (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n\n    These two states have the same energy, E1 = -3J. This energy level has a degeneracy (number of states) of g1 = 2.\n\n3.  **Two spins are up, and one is down:** There are three such configurations:\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1): E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n4.  **One spin is up, and two are down:** There are three such configurations:\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = -J(-1) = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n    All six of these states (3 from case 3 and 3 from case 4) have the same energy, E2 = J. This energy level has a degeneracy of g2 = 6.\n\nNow, we can write the partition function by summing the contributions from each energy level, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum over all possible microstates of the system. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2^3 = 8 possible configurations.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as:\nZ = Σ_states * e^(-βE)\nwhere the sum is over all 8 possible spin configurations and β = 1/(kT).\n\nLet's calculate the energy for each possible state:\n\n1.  **All spins are up:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n    There is one such state.\n\n2.  **All spins are down:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n    There is one such state.\n\n    Together, these two states have an energy of -3J. Their contribution to the partition function is 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ).\n\n3.  **Two spins are up, and one is down:**\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J\n    There are three such states, each with an energy of J.\n\n4.  **One spin is up, and two are down:**\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J\n    There are three such states, each also with an energy of J.\n\n    In total, there are 3 + 3 = 6 states with an energy of J. Their combined contribution to the partition function is 6 * e^(-β(J)) = 6e^(-Jβ).\n\nNow, we sum the contributions from all the energy levels to get the total partition function Z:\n\nZ = (Contribution from E = -3J) + (Contribution from E = J)\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the partition function Z.\n\n**1. Define the System and States**\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\nEach spin can take a value of +1 or -1.\nThe total number of possible microstates for the system is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Define the Partition Function**\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all possible states (i) of the Boltzmann factor for that state:\nZ = Σ_i e^(-βE_i)\nwhere E_i is the energy of the i-th state and β = 1/(kT).\n\n**3. List all Possible States and Calculate their Energies**\nThe energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\nWe need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible states.\n\nLet's list the states and their corresponding energies:\n\n*   **State 1: All spins up**\n    (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n*   **State 2: All spins down**\n    (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n*   **State 3: One spin down, two spins up**\n    There are three such configurations:\n    a) (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n       E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    b) (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n       E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    c) (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n       E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\n*   **State 4: One spin up, two spins down**\n    There are three such configurations:\n    a) (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n       E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    b) (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n       E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    c) (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n       E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\n**4. Group States by Energy (Find Degeneracy)**\nWe have found two distinct energy levels for the system:\n\n*   **Energy Level 1:** E1 = -3J\n    This energy level corresponds to the states where all spins are aligned (all up or all down).\n    The number of states with this energy (degeneracy) is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2:** E2 = J\n    This energy level corresponds to the states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two.\n    The number of states with this energy (degeneracy) is g2 = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n**5. Calculate the Partition Function**\nNow we can write the partition function by summing over the energy levels, taking into account their degeneracies:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z.\n\n**1.

Then, Z = Σ_levels g_i * e^(-βE_i), where g_i is the degeneracy of the energy level E_i.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: List all possible states and calculate their energies.**\n\nLet's list the 8 states and calculate the term `S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3` for each.\n\n| State # | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1*S2 | S1*S3 | S2*S3 | Sum (S1S2+S1S3+S2S3) | Energy E = -J * (Sum) |\n|:-------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:---------------------:|:-----------------------:|\n| 1       | +1 | +1 | +1 |   +1  |   +1  |   +1  |          +3           |          -3J            |\n| 2       | +1 | +1 | -1 |   +1  |   -1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 3       | +1 | -1 | +1 |   -1  |   +1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 4       | -1 | +1 | +1 |   -1  |   -1  |   +1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 5       | +1 | -1 | -1 |   -1  |   -1  |   +1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 6       | -1 | +1 | -1 |   -1  |   +1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 7       | -1 | -1 | +1 |   +1  |   -1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 8       | -1 | -1 | -1 |   +1  |   +1  |   +1  |          +3           |          -3J            |\n\n**Careful Point:** Notice the symmetry. The energy only depends on how many spins are aligned with each other.\n\n**Step B: Group states by energy level and find their degeneracy.**\n\nFrom the table above, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy Level 1: E₁ = -3J**\n    *   This occurs when all three spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1).\n    *   States: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The degeneracy (number of states) for this energy level is **g₁ = 2**.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2: E₂ = +J**\n    *   This occurs when one spin is flipped relative to the other two (two are +1 and one is -1, or two are -1 and one is +1).\n    *   States: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1).\n    *   The degeneracy for this energy level is **g₂ = 6**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The sum of degeneracies must equal the total number of states: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8. This confirms we have accounted for all states.\n\n**Step C: Construct the Partition Function Z.**\n\nNow, we use the formula Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂).\n\n*   For the first energy level (E₁ = -3J, g₁ = 2):\n    *   The term is: 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) = **2 * e^(3Jβ)**\n\n*   For the second energy level (E₂ = +J, g₂ = 6):\n    *   The term is: 6 * e^(-β * (+J)) = **6 * e^(-Jβ)**\n\n**Careful Point:** Be very careful with the signs in the exponent. The formula has a negative sign, `e^(-βE)`. When the energy E is negative (like -3J), the two negatives cancel, resulting in a positive exponent `e^(3Jβ)`.\n\n**Step D: Combine the terms to get the final answer.**\n\nAdding the terms for all energy levels gives the total partition function:\n\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the partition function Z.\n\n### 1.

The energy is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The partition function is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, Z = Σ_states exp(-βE).\n\nMy proposed solution path is to:\n1.  List all possible microstates of the system. Since there are 3 spins with 2 states each, there are 2^3 = 8 total microstates.\n2.  For each microstate, calculate the corresponding energy E.\n3.  Group the states by their energy values to find the degeneracy of each energy level.\n4.  Calculate the partition function by summing the term g * exp(-βE) for each unique energy level, where 'g' is the degeneracy.\n\nThis is a self-contained theoretical problem, so no external search is required. I will proceed with the calculation.\n\nSkeptic: The proposed method is correct, but it is susceptible to manual calculation errors. There are 8 states, and for each state, three products and a sum must be calculated. A single error in any of these calculations will lead to an incorrect result. For instance, confusing the signs of J or β, or miscalculating the product of spins (e.g., -1 * -1 = -1) are common pitfalls. It is critical to be systematic. Let's double-check the energy calculation for a mixed state, say (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1).\nE = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J.\nThis seems correct. The key will be to carefully enumerate all 8 states and their energies and then correctly sum them to form the partition function.\n\nDecide: The analytical approach is the correct and only way to solve this problem. The skeptic's concerns about calculation errors are valid and highlight the need for a careful and systematic execution of the plan. I will create a table to organize the states, energies, and degeneracies to ensure accuracy.\n\n| State | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 | Energy (E) | Term in Z |\n| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | +1 | +1 | +1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | -3J | e^(3Jβ) |\n| 2 | +1 | +1 | -1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 3 | +1 | -1 | +1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 4 | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 5 | -1 | +1 | +1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 6 | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 7 | -1 | -1 | +1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 8 | -1 | -1 | -1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | -3J | e^(3Jβ) |\n\nFrom the table, we can identify two distinct energy levels:\n1.  **E1 = -3J**: This occurs for the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1). The degeneracy is 2.\n2.  **E2 = +J**: This occurs for the other 6 states. The degeneracy is 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the terms for all states:\nZ = (Number of states with E1) * e^(-βE1) + (Number of states with E2) * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * -3J) + 6 * e^(-β * J)\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis result matches option D.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Objective**: To find the partition function Z for a system of three spins with energy E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e<sup>-βE</sup>, over all possible microstates of the system.\nZ = Σ<sub>states</sub> e<sup>-βE</sup>\n\n### Step 1: Identify All Possible States and Their Energies\n\nThe system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each can be +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates. We must calculate the energy for each one.\n\nA systematic way to do this is to group the states by the number of \"up\" (+1) and \"down\" (-1) spins.\n\n**Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n*   State 1: (+1, +1, +1) -> E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n*   State 2: (-1, -1, -1) -> E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n\n**Careful Point:** The energy depends on the product of the spins. Since (-1) * (-1) = +1, the all-down state has the same energy as the all-up state.\n\n**Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\nThis covers all remaining states. Let's calculate the energy for one example from this group.\n*   State 3: (+1, +1, -1) -> E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n\n**Careful Point:** By symmetry, any state with two spins in one direction and the third in the opposite direction will have the same energy. We can verify this for a state with two down spins and one up spin:\n*   State 4: (+1, -1, -1) -> E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n\nAll 6 states in this category have the same energy, +J. These states are:\n(+,+,-), (+,-,+), (-,+,+), (+,-,-), (-,+,-), (-,-,+)\n\n### Step 2: Group States by Energy Level (Find Degeneracy)\n\nFrom the calculations above, we have two distinct energy levels:\n\n1.  **Energy Level E₁ = -3J**: This level has 2 states. Its degeneracy is **g₁ = 2**.\n2.  **Energy Level E₂ = +J**: This level has 6 states. Its degeneracy is **g₂ = 6**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The sum of the degeneracies must equal the total number of states. Here, g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8, which confirms we have accounted for all possible microstates.\n\n### Step 3: Construct the Partition Function\n\nThe partition function can be written as a sum over the unique energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g₁ * e<sup>-βE₁</sup> + g₂ * e<sup>-βE₂</sup>\n\nNow, we substitute the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e<sup>-β(-3J)</sup> + 6 * e<sup>-β(+J)</sup>\n\n**Careful Point:** Pay close attention to the signs in the exponents. The formula for the Boltzmann factor has a negative sign, e<sup>-βE</sup>. When the energy E is itself negative (like E₁ = -3J), the two negatives cancel.\nZ = 2e<sup>3Jβ</sup> + 6e<sup>-Jβ</sup>\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options\n\nThe calculated partition function is **Z = 2e<sup>3Jβ</sup> + 6e<sup>-Jβ</sup>**.\n\nLet's compare this to the options provided:\nA) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nB) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nOur result exactly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

The search results confirm the methodology for calculating the partition function for a system of spins. The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors, e^(-βE), over all possible microstates of the system.\n\nThe steps are:\n1.  Identify all possible microstates of the system. For three spins (S1, S2, S3) that can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states.\n2.  Calculate the energy E for each microstate using the given Hamiltonian: E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n3.  Group the states by their energy level and determine the degeneracy (the number of states with the same energy).\n4.  Calculate the partition function Z by summing the term g * e^(-βE) for each energy level, where g is the degeneracy.\n\nMy calculation followed these steps precisely.\n\n*   **States with all spins parallel:**\n    *   (+, +, +): E = -J(1+1+1) = -3J\n    *   (-, -, -): E = -J(1+1+1) = -3J\n    *   These two states have an energy of -3J. The degeneracy is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **States with one spin flipped:**\n    *   (+, +, -): E = -J(1-1-1) = J\n    *   (+, -, +): E = -J(-1+1-1) = J\n    *   (-, +, +): E = -J(-1-1+1) = J\n    *   (+, -, -): E = -J(-1-1+1) = J\n    *   (-, +, -): E = -J(-1+1-1) = J\n    *   (-, -, +): E = -J(1-1-1) = J\n    *   These six states all have an energy of J. The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\n*   **Partition Function Z:**\n    *   Z = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\n    *   Z = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\n    *   Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis result matches option B. The search results, particularly those discussing the Ising model on a triangular lattice, confirm that systems with this type of interaction (three spins interacting in a triangle) have these two energy levels. For a ferromagnetic interaction (J>0), the ground state (lowest energy) is when all spins are aligned, and the next energy level occurs when one spin is flipped. My calculation is consistent with this.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta) - Incorrect energies and degeneracies.\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta) - Matches my calculation.\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta) - Incorrect energies.\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta) - Incorrect signs in the exponents.\n\nThe calculation is robust.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1.

This energy level has a degeneracy (number of states) of g1 = 2.\n\n3.  **Two spins are up, and one is down:** There are three such configurations:\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1): E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n4.  **One spin is up, and two are down:** There are three such configurations:\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = -J(-1) = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n    All six of these states (3 from case 3 and 3 from case 4) have the same energy, E2 = J. This energy level has a degeneracy of g2 = 6.\n\nNow, we can write the partition function by summing the contributions from each energy level, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum over all possible microstates of the system.

Then, Z = Σ_levels g_i * e^(-βE_i), where g_i is the degeneracy of the energy level E_i.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: List all possible states and calculate their energies.**\n\nLet's list the 8 states and calculate the term `S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3` for each.\n\n| State # | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1*S2 | S1*S3 | S2*S3 | Sum (S1S2+S1S3+S2S3) | Energy E = -J * (Sum) |\n|:-------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:---------------------:|:-----------------------:|\n| 1       | +1 | +1 | +1 |   +1  |   +1  |   +1  |          +3           |          -3J            |\n| 2       | +1 | +1 | -1 |   +1  |   -1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 3       | +1 | -1 | +1 |   -1  |   +1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 4       | -1 | +1 | +1 |   -1  |   -1  |   +1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 5       | +1 | -1 | -1 |   -1  |   -1  |   +1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 6       | -1 | +1 | -1 |   -1  |   +1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 7       | -1 | -1 | +1 |   +1  |   -1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 8       | -1 | -1 | -1 |   +1  |   +1  |   +1  |          +3           |          -3J            |\n\n**Careful Point:** Notice the symmetry. The energy only depends on how many spins are aligned with each other.\n\n**Step B: Group states by energy level and find their degeneracy.**\n\nFrom the table above, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy Level 1: E₁ = -3J**\n    *   This occurs when all three spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1).\n    *   States: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The degeneracy (number of states) for this energy level is **g₁ = 2**.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2: E₂ = +J**\n    *   This occurs when one spin is flipped relative to the other two (two are +1 and one is -1, or two are -1 and one is +1).\n    *   States: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1).\n    *   The degeneracy for this energy level is **g₂ = 6**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The sum of degeneracies must equal the total number of states: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8. This confirms we have accounted for all states.\n\n**Step C: Construct the Partition Function Z.**\n\nNow, we use the formula Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂).\n\n*   For the first energy level (E₁ = -3J, g₁ = 2):\n    *   The term is: 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) = **2 * e^(3Jβ)**\n\n*   For the second energy level (E₂ = +J, g₂ = 6):\n    *   The term is: 6 * e^(-β * (+J)) = **6 * e^(-Jβ)**\n\n**Careful Point:** Be very careful with the signs in the exponent. The formula has a negative sign, `e^(-βE)`. When the energy E is negative (like -3J), the two negatives cancel, resulting in a positive exponent `e^(3Jβ)`.\n\n**Step D: Combine the terms to get the final answer.**\n\nAdding the terms for all energy levels gives the total partition function:\n\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the partition function Z.\n\n### 1.

Grouping by Energy Levels (Degeneracy)\n\nNow, we group the states that have the same energy. The number of states at a given energy level is called its degeneracy (g).\n\n*   **Energy Level E1 = -3J:**\n    *   This energy occurs for the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The degeneracy is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level E2 = +J:**\n    *   This energy occurs for the remaining 6 states: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, +1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    *   The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Partition Function\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for each energy level, multiplied by their degeneracies.\n\nZ = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i)\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\n\nSubstitute the values we found:\n\n*   g1 = 2, E1 = -3J\n*   g2 = 6, E2 = +J\n\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\n### 5.

The formula is:\n    Z = Σ_i exp(-E_i / kT) = Σ_i exp(-β * E_i)\n    where `i` represents each possible state, `E_i` is the energy of that state, and `β = 1/(kT)`.\n\n3.  **Define the System's States:**\n    *   The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, S3.\n    *   Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n    *   The total number of possible states (configurations) is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\n4.  **Define the Energy of the System:** The energy for any given state is defined by the Hamiltonian:\n    E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\n5.  **Systematic Approach:** To find Z, we must:\n    a.

The energy is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The partition function is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, Z = Σ_states exp(-βE).\n\nMy proposed solution path is to:\n1.  List all possible microstates of the system. Since there are 3 spins with 2 states each, there are 2^3 = 8 total microstates.\n2.  For each microstate, calculate the corresponding energy E.\n3.  Group the states by their energy values to find the degeneracy of each energy level.\n4.  Calculate the partition function by summing the term g * exp(-βE) for each unique energy level, where 'g' is the degeneracy.\n\nThis is a self-contained theoretical problem, so no external search is required. I will proceed with the calculation.\n\nSkeptic: The proposed method is correct, but it is susceptible to manual calculation errors. There are 8 states, and for each state, three products and a sum must be calculated. A single error in any of these calculations will lead to an incorrect result. For instance, confusing the signs of J or β, or miscalculating the product of spins (e.g., -1 * -1 = -1) are common pitfalls. It is critical to be systematic. Let's double-check the energy calculation for a mixed state, say (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1).\nE = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J.\nThis seems correct. The key will be to carefully enumerate all 8 states and their energies and then correctly sum them to form the partition function.\n\nDecide: The analytical approach is the correct and only way to solve this problem. The skeptic's concerns about calculation errors are valid and highlight the need for a careful and systematic execution of the plan. I will create a table to organize the states, energies, and degeneracies to ensure accuracy.\n\n| State | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 | Energy (E) | Term in Z |\n| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | +1 | +1 | +1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | -3J | e^(3Jβ) |\n| 2 | +1 | +1 | -1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 3 | +1 | -1 | +1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 4 | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 5 | -1 | +1 | +1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 6 | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 7 | -1 | -1 | +1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 8 | -1 | -1 | -1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | -3J | e^(3Jβ) |\n\nFrom the table, we can identify two distinct energy levels:\n1.  **E1 = -3J**: This occurs for the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1). The degeneracy is 2.\n2.  **E2 = +J**: This occurs for the other 6 states. The degeneracy is 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the terms for all states:\nZ = (Number of states with E1) * e^(-βE1) + (Number of states with E2) * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * -3J) + 6 * e^(-β * J)\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis result matches option D.
