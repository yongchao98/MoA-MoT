    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the energy levels of a system of four fermions
    in a 1D infinite potential well.

    The code verifies the answer by:
    1. Defining the system's constraints (4 fermions, max 2 per level).
    2. Systematically generating all possible valid particle configurations.
    3. Calculating the total energy for each configuration in units of E.
    4. Sorting the unique energy values to find the ground, first, and second excited states.
    5. Comparing these calculated values to the values given in the selected answer choice 'A'.
