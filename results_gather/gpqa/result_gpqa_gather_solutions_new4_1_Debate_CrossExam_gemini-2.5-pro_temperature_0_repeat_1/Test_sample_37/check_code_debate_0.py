Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

### 1. Analysis of the Starting Material and Reaction Type
*   **Starting Material:** The reactant is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an **iminium salt**. It is formed from the reaction of a ketone, **pentan-2-one** (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`), and a secondary amine, **N-methylethanamine** (`CH₃NHCH₂CH₃`).
*   **Reaction Type:** The sequence of reagents (a strong base, an alkylating agent, and an acid workup) is characteristic of the **Stork enamine synthesis**. This reaction is a method for adding an alkyl group to the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) of a ketone.

### 2. Step-by-Step Reaction Mechanism

*   **Step (i): Deprotonation to form an Enamine**
    *   The first reagent is **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)**, a strong and sterically bulky base. It is used to remove a proton from a carbon alpha (α) to the iminium group.
    *   The pentan-2-one skeleton has two different α-positions: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3.
    *   Because LDA is bulky, it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered position. This is the **C1 methyl group**. This is known as kinetic control.
    *   The deprotonation of the iminium salt at C1 results in the formation of a neutral, nucleophilic **enamine**: `CH₂=C(N(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃))-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.

*   **Step (ii): Alkylation**
    *   The enamine formed in the previous step is a good nucleophile. The α-carbon (C1) attacks the electrophilic carbon of the alkylating agent, **ethyl iodide (CH₃CH₂I)**, in an Sₙ2 reaction.
    *   This step attaches an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) to the C1 carbon, forming a new, larger iminium salt.

*   **Step (iii): Hydrolysis**
    *   The final step is the addition of an aqueous acid solution (**H₃O⁺**). This hydrolyzes the new iminium salt.
    *   The carbon-nitrogen double bond (C=N⁺) is cleaved and replaced with a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), yielding the final ketone product.

### 3. Identification of the Final Product (B)

*   The original carbon skeleton was from pentan-2-one (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).
*   An ethyl group (`CH₃CH₂-`) was added to the C1 carbon.
*   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.
*   To name this ketone, we find the longest carbon chain containing the carbonyl group, which is seven carbons long (a heptane chain). Numbering from either end places the carbonyl group at position 4.
*   Therefore, the product (B) is **heptan-4-one**.

### 4. Determination of the Reagent Sequence (A)

*   For the reaction to be successful, the reagents must be added in a specific, sequential order.
    1.  First, the base (LDA) in its solvent (DME) is added to create the nucleophile.
    2.  Second, the alkylating agent (CH₃CH₂I) is added to react with the nucleophile.
    3.  Third, the acid (H₃O⁺) is added to hydrolyze the intermediate and isolate the final product.
*   The correct representation for this sequence is `A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`.

### 5. Conclusion

Based on the analysis:
*   The correct sequence of reagents (A) is **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.
*   The correct final product (B) is **heptan-4-one**.

This combination matches option C perfectly.
