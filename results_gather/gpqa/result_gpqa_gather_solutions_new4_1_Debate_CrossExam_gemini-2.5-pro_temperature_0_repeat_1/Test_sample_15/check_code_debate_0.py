def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by analyzing each compound for optical activity.

    A compound is optically active if it is chiral. Key indicators are:
    - Presence of chiral centers (e.g., a carbon with 4 different substituents).
    - Absence of internal symmetry (planes of symmetry, centers of inversion).
    - Molecules with stereochemical descriptors (R, S) are single enantiomers and active,
      unless they are meso compounds.
    - Meso compounds have chiral centers but are achiral due to internal symmetry.
