Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

**Step 1: Understand the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT)**
The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model (SM). It assumes that any new physics exists at an energy scale (Î›) much higher than the energies accessible by current experiments. The effects of this new physics at lower energies are described by adding higher-dimensional operators (operators with a mass dimension greater than 4) to the Standard Model Lagrangian. A crucial point is that these new operators must be constructed using only SM fields and must respect the fundamental symmetries of the underlying theoretical framework.

**Step 2: Analyze each symmetry individually.**

*   **1. Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental spacetime symmetry of special relativity, which states that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion (i.e., invariant under rotations and boosts). The Standard Model is a relativistic quantum field theory (QFT), and Lorentz invariance is a foundational principle. SMEFT is built upon this same foundation, so all operators in its Lagrangian must be constructed to be Lorentz invariant (specifically, Lorentz scalars). Therefore, Lorentz symmetry **must** be respected.

*   **2. Poincare Symmetry:** This is the full group of spacetime symmetries in special relativity. It includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. Invariance under translations ensures the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a foundational assumption for any local, relativistic QFT, including the SM and SMEFT. Therefore, Poincare symmetry **must** be respected.

*   **3. CP Symmetry:** This is the symmetry under the combined operation of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P). It is a well-established experimental fact that the weak interactions within the Standard Model violate CP symmetry. Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it is not required to be CP-symmetric. In fact, one of the primary goals of the SMEFT program is to parameterize and search for new potential sources of CP violation from physics beyond the Standard Model. Thus, CP symmetry is **not** a required symmetry for all operators.

*   **4. CPT Symmetry:** This is the symmetry under the combined operation of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T). The **CPT Theorem** is a fundamental result in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant QFT with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT invariant. Since SMEFT is constructed to be a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.

**Step 3: Synthesize the results and select the correct option.**

Based on the analysis:
*   Lorentz Symmetry (1) **is required**.
*   Poincare Symmetry (2) **is required**.
*   CP Symmetry (3) is **not required**.
*   CPT Symmetry (4) **is required**.

The set of symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT is {1, 2, 4}.

This corresponds to option B.
