    Checks the correctness of the answer to the quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem asks for:
    1. Probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of operator A.
    2. The average value of operator A.

    The proposed correct answer is B: Probabilities 0.64, 0.36 and average value hbar/7.
