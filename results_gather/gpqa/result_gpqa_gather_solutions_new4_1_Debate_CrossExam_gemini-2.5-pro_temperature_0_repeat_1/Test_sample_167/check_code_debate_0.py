Here is a step-by-step analysis of the candidate answers to determine the final, most accurate response.

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Core Question

The question asks to identify the **most common** sources of **difficult-to-spot** erroneous results in genomics data analysis. The key criteria are:
1.  **Common**: The issue must occur frequently in real-world analysis.
2.  **Difficult-to-spot**: The error should not cause an immediate or obvious failure (like a program crash). Instead, it should produce results that appear plausible but are silently incorrect, leading to flawed scientific conclusions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Consensus on Each Issue

I will analyze the reasoning provided in the 16 candidate answers for each of the four potential issues.

*   **1. Mutually incompatible data formats:**
    *   **Argument for inclusion:** Many candidates (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 9, 13) argue that while some format errors are obvious, many are subtle and difficult to spot. Examples include differences in coordinate systems (0-based vs. 1-based), varying quality score encodings, or non-standard fields in a file that are silently ignored or misinterpreted by software. Answer 9 even cites a study where 75 out of 80 software packages failed to correctly parse a common format, suggesting subtle errors are widespread.
    *   **Argument for exclusion:** A few candidates (e.g., 3, 5, 7) argue that this type of error *usually* results in an immediate crash, making it easy to spot.
    *   **Conclusion:** There is strong evidence presented across the answers that this category is a frequent source of subtle, hard-to-spot errors, even if it also causes obvious ones.

*   **2. The "chr" / "no chr" confusion:**
    *   **Argument for inclusion:** There is unanimous agreement across the candidates that this is a classic, pervasive, and difficult-to-spot problem. The consistent reasoning is that tools do not crash but instead silently fail to find overlaps, reporting "0 results." A researcher can easily misinterpret this as a valid biological finding instead of a technical error.
    *   **Argument for exclusion:** None.
    *   **Conclusion:** This is definitively a common and difficult-to-spot source of error.

*   **3. Reference assembly mismatch:**
    *   **Argument for inclusion:** There is unanimous agreement that this is one of the most insidious and dangerous sources of error. All candidates who discuss it agree that using data from different genome builds (e.g., hg19 vs. hg38) will produce plausible-looking but completely incorrect results, as the genomic coordinates will not match. The analysis runs without warnings, making the error extremely difficult to detect.
    *   **Argument for exclusion:** None.
    *   **Conclusion:** This is definitively a common and difficult-to-spot source of error.

*   **4. Incorrect ID conversion:**
    *   **Argument for inclusion:** There is unanimous agreement that this is a widespread and difficult-to-spot problem. The famous example of spreadsheet software auto-converting gene names (e.g., "SEPT2" to "2-Sep") is cited repeatedly. The error is silent, leads to data loss, and corrupts downstream analyses without any software warnings. Several answers cite studies showing this error affects a large percentage of published papers.
    *   **Argument for exclusion:** None.
    *   **Conclusion:** This is definitively a common and difficult-to-spot source of error.

### Step 3: Synthesize and Select the Final Answer

The analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong, unanimous consensus that issues **2, 3, and 4** are common sources of difficult-to-spot errors.

The only point of debate is issue **1 (Mutually incompatible data formats)**. However, the majority of the detailed rationales argue that this category *does* include many common and subtle errors (like coordinate system mismatches) that fit the "difficult-to-spot" criterion perfectly. The argument that it *only* causes obvious crashes is an oversimplification.

Since the question asks for the "most common sources" and does not require that the issues *only* cause difficult-to-spot errors, and since strong evidence is presented for all four issues being frequent sources of such errors, the most comprehensive and accurate answer is that all four are correct.

This corresponds to option A.
