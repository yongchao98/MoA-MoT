def check_special_relativity_problem():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the special relativity problem.

    The core of the problem is calculating the proper time (time experienced by the astronaut)
    for a journey from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to Earth. This requires applying
    the time dilation formula from special relativity.

    A key piece of information, the distance to the LMC, is not provided in the question.
    The provided solution correctly deduces that a standard astronomical value must be used,
    and that the problem was likely designed such that the calculation would point to one
    of the multiple-choice answers.

    The solution uses a distance of 160,000 light-years, a common and reasonable value for the LMC.
    This check will replicate the calculation using that distance to verify the conclusion.
