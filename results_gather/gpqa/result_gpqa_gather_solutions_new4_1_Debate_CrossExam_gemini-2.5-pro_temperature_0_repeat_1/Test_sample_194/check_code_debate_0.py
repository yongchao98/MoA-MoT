    # --- Given parameters from the question ---
    P1 = 3.0  # Orbital period of Planet 1 in days
    b1 = 0.2  # Impact parameter of Planet 1

    # --- Physical and logical constraints ---
    # The maximum period for Planet 2 corresponds to the maximum impact parameter (b2)
    # that allows for a transit. The standard definition for this limit is a "grazing"
    # transit of the planet's center, which means b2_max = 1.
    b2_max = 1.0

    # --- Calculation ---
    # Step 1: Find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1).
    # Since b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s, and i and R_s are constant for the system,
    # the ratio a2/a1 is equal to the ratio b2/b1.
    a_ratio = b2_max / b1

    # Step 2: Apply Kepler's Third Law to find the maximum period for Planet 2 (P2_max).
    # (P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3  =>  P2 = P1 * (a2 / a1)^(3/2)
    P2_max = P1 * (a_ratio ** 1.5)

    # --- Verification ---
    # The provided answer is 'A', which corresponds to ~33.5 days.
    llm_choice = 'A'
    options = {'A': 33.5, 'B': 37.5, 'C': 12.5, 'D': 7.5}
    
    # Check if the calculated value is close to the value of the chosen option.
    # A relative tolerance of 5% is used to account for the "~" in the options.
    if not math.isclose(P2_max, options[llm_choice], rel_tol=0.05):
        # If it's not close, find the correct option and report the error.
        best_match_option = min(options.keys(), key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - P2_max))
        return (f"Incorrect. The calculated maximum period is approximately {P2_max:.2f} days. "
                f"This value corresponds to option {best_match_option} (~{options[best_match_option]}). "
                f"The provided answer was {llm_choice}, which is incorrect.")

    # The reasoning in the provided answer is sound:
    # 1. It correctly identifies that the maximum period corresponds to b2_max = 1.
    # 2. It correctly derives the ratio of semi-major axes as a2/a1 = 1/0.2 = 5.
    # 3. It correctly applies Kepler's Third Law to calculate P2_max = 3 * (5)^(3/2).
    # 4. The final numerical result of ~33.54 days matches option A.
    # Since both the calculation and the reasoning are correct, the answer is correct.
    return "Correct"
