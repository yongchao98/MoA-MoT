    # --- Analysis of Option D (The proposed correct answer) ---
    # This sequence uses a temporary directing group (-NH2) to achieve the
    # difficult 1,3,5-substitution pattern with high yield.
    
    # Step i: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone
    # Product: Acetophenone. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director. This is a valid start.
    
    # Step ii: Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 3-Bromoacetophenone
    # Product: 3-Bromoacetophenone. The meta-directing -COCH3 group correctly places Br at C3.
    
    # Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone
    # The ring has a meta-director (-COCH3) and an ortho,para-director (-Br).
    # The major product is the 4-nitro isomer, which serves as the key intermediate.
    
    # Step iv: Product from (iii) + Fe/HCl -> 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone
    # The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2), a powerful ortho,para-director.
    
    # Step v: Product from (iv) + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone
    # This is the crucial regioselective step. The powerful -NH2 group at C4 directs the
    # incoming -NO2 group to its ortho position (C5), as C3 is blocked.
    
    # Step vi: Product from (v) + NaNO2/HCl -> Diazonium salt
    # The temporary amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt.
    
    # Step vii: Diazonium salt + H3PO2 -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one
    # The diazonium group is removed (deamination), yielding the final target molecule.

    # --- Analysis of Other Options ---

    # converting benzene to nitrobenzene and then back to benzene.
