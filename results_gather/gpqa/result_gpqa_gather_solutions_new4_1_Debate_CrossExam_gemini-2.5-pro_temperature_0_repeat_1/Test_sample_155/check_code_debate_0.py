Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct reasoning from the provided answers.

### **Step 1: Analyze the product of Reaction 1**

*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. It is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.
*   **Reagents & Transformation:** The two-step process of epoxidation with mCPBA followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (with H₂O as the nucleophile) results in the overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. This means two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to opposite faces of the original double bond.
*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-established rule for stereospecific reactions: the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-(E)-alkene results in a meso compound.
*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral product is formed: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.

### **Step 2: Analyze the product of Reaction 2**

*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene. It is also a symmetrical and achiral molecule.
*   **Reagents & Transformation:** The same reagents are used, resulting in the same overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.
*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The corresponding stereochemical rule is: the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-(Z)-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.
*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A pair of enantiomers is formed in a 1:1 ratio: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.

### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**

The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:
1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)
2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)
3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)

The relationship between these isomers is crucial:
*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** of each other.
*   Compound 1 (the meso compound) is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3.

### **Step 4: Predict the Chromatographic Observations**

*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**
    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.
    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together and appear as a single peak.
    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.
    *   Therefore, the mixture will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and a second peak for the co-eluting (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers.

*   **Chiral HPLC:**
    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.
    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.
    *   It also separates diastereomers.
    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.
    *   The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-diol, and one for the (4S,5S)-diol.

### **Careful Points to Consider:**

1.  **Reaction Stereochemistry:** It is essential to correctly identify the overall transformation as an *anti*-dihydroxylation and apply the correct stereochemical rules (Trans + Anti → Meso; Cis + Anti → Racemic). A mistake here, such as concluding the opposite products are formed (as seen in candidate answer 1), invalidates the entire analysis.
2.  **Mixture Composition:** The final mixture contains three stereoisomers, not two or four. It is composed of one meso compound and one pair of enantiomers.
3.  **Principles of Chromatography:** One must clearly distinguish between the capabilities of achiral and chiral HPLC. Achiral columns separate diastereomers but not enantiomers. Chiral columns separate both.
4.  **Matching Reasoning to Options:** Several candidate answers (e.g., 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15) correctly deduce a "2 peak, 3 peak" outcome but then select an incorrect final letter (B or C). It is critical to match the correct reasoning to the corresponding multiple-choice option. The conclusion of 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC corresponds directly to option D.

Based on the step-by-step analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.
