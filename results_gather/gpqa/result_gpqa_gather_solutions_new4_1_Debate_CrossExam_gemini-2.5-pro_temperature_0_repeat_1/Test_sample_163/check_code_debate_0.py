    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including all the careful points, to arrive at the final answer.

    ### Step-by-Step Analysis

    1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This is a ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (M_sys1 / M_sys2).

    2.  **Extract Given Information:**
        *   **System 1:**
            *   Orbital Period (P₁): 2 years
            *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₁ₐ, K₁ₑ): 10 km/s and 5 km/s
        *   **System 2:**
            *   Orbital Period (P₂): 1 year
            *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₂ₐ, K₂ₑ): 15 km/s and 10 km/s

    3.  **Identify Relevant Physical Principles:** The problem involves double-lined spectroscopic binary stars. The total mass of such a system can be found using a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law, which relates the mass to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ and K₂).

    4.  **Analyze Careful Points and Simplifications:**
        *   **Eclipsing Systems:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a critical piece of information. For eclipses to occur, the orbital plane must be viewed nearly edge-on from our line of sight. This means the inclination angle *i* is approximately 90°.
        *   **Inclination Simplification:** When *i* ≈ 90°, sin(*i*) ≈ 1. The full formula for the total mass is M₁ + M₂ = [ P / (2πG) ] * (K₁ + K₂ )³ / sin³(*i*). Since sin³(*i*) ≈ 1 for both systems, this term can be ignored when calculating the ratio.
        *   **Proportionality:** Due to the simplifications, the total mass of the system is directly proportional to its period multiplied by the cube of the sum of its velocity amplitudes: M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³.
        *   **Units:** When calculating the ratio, the gravitational constant (G) and other constants cancel out. We can use the given units (years and km/s) directly, as they will also cancel out, leaving a dimensionless factor.

    5.  **Perform the Calculation:**
        *   First, calculate the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes for each system:
            *   System 1 (K_total₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s
            *   System 2 (K_total₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s
        *   Next, set up the ratio of the masses using the proportionality derived in step 4:
            M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P₁ * (K_total₁)³] / [P₂ * (K_total₂)³]
        *   Substitute the known values into the equation:
            M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]
        *   Simplify the expression:
            M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³
            M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³
            M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (27 / 125)
            M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 54 / 125
        *   Calculate the final decimal value:
            M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432

    6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated factor is 0.432. This value must be compared to the options provided in the question:
        *   A) ~ 0.4
        *   B) ~ 1.2
        *   C) ~ 0.6
        *   D) ~ 0.7

        The calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.
