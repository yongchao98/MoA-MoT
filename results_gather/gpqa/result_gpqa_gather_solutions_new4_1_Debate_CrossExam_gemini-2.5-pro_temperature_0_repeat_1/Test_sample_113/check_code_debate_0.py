    # 1. Analyze Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
    # This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction.
    # The mechanism involves two steps:
    #   a) Nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN-) from NaCN on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.
    #      This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.
    #   b) Protonation of the negatively charged alkoxide intermediate to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.
    # Reagent 'A' must be a proton source (an acid) for step (b).
    # Let's evaluate the choices for A:
    #   - H3O+: Represents an acid in aqueous solution. It is an excellent proton source for this step.
    #   - NaHSO3: Sodium bisulfite is a reagent for a different type of carbonyl addition reaction (bisulfite addition), not for completing cyanohydrin formation.
    # Conclusion for Reaction 1: Reagent A must be H3O+.

    # 2. Analyze Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid
    # This reaction converts a nitrile group (-Câ‰¡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).
    # This is a nitrile hydrolysis reaction.
    # Nitrile hydrolysis is typically catalyzed by a strong acid or a strong base, usually with heating.
    # Reagent 'B' is the catalyst.
    # Let's evaluate the choices for B:
    #   - HCl: Hydrochloric acid is a strong mineral acid. It is a standard and effective catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis.
    #   - CH3COOH: Acetic acid is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to efficiently catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.
    # Conclusion for Reaction 2: Reagent B must be HCl.
