Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Experimental Setup
*   **Technique**: ChIP-seq is used to find where a protein binds to DNA across the genome.
*   **Protein**: IKAROS, a key transcription factor in B cell development. Transcription factors can bind DNA directly or as part of larger protein complexes.
*   **Variable**: The chemical fixation method is the key difference between the two experiments. Fixation "freezes" protein-DNA interactions.
    *   **Condition 1 (Peaks Present)**: PFA (paraformaldehyde) only. PFA is a short-range cross-linker, primarily capturing proteins that are in very close proximity to DNA (~2 Å). This is the standard method.
    *   **Condition 2 (Peaks Disappear)**: PFA + DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate). This is a dual-cross-linking method. DSG is a longer-range (~7.7 Å) protein-to-protein cross-linker. It is used first to stabilize large protein complexes, and then PFA is used to link the entire complex to DNA.

### Step 2: Analyze the Core Observation
The central puzzle is that peaks observed with the standard PFA method *disappear* when using the PFA+DSG method. Intuitively, one might expect a "stronger" fixation method like PFA+DSG to capture *more* or *stronger* signals, not cause them to vanish. This counterintuitive result points to a specific technical or biological phenomenon related to the different fixation chemistries.

### Step 3: Formulate and Evaluate Competing Hypotheses

There are two primary, well-reasoned hypotheses to explain this observation.

*   **Hypothesis 1: Epitope Masking at Active Promoters and Enhancers.**
    *   **Mechanism**: IKAROS functions by assembling large, dense, multi-protein complexes at the regulatory regions of genes, namely **active promoters and enhancers**. The addition of the protein-protein cross-linker DSG could create such a dense, cross-linked web of proteins around IKAROS that it physically blocks or alters the antibody's binding site (the epitope). If the antibody cannot bind to IKAROS, the complex cannot be immunoprecipitated, and the peak "disappears".
    *   **Evaluation**: This is a plausible general mechanism. However, dual-cross-linking is often used specifically to *improve* the signal for transcription factors at these very sites by stabilizing the complexes. A complete loss of signal would be a severe artifact.

*   **Hypothesis 2: Loss of Weaker or Artifactual Peaks at Repeats.**
    *   **Mechanism**: This hypothesis posits that the disappearing peaks were not at the primary functional sites (promoters/enhancers) but at other locations. The specific biology of IKAROS is critical here: it is well-documented to bind extensively to **pericentromeric heterochromatin**, which is composed of highly repetitive DNA sequences. These interactions might be structurally important but of a different nature (e.g., lower affinity, more transient) than those at active genes. The PFA-only method might be sufficient to capture these interactions, which can appear as "unusually strong ChIP-seq peaks" due to the high density of binding sites in repetitive regions. The more stringent PFA+DSG method could then cause these peaks to disappear in two ways:
        1.  **Insolubility**: The extensive cross-linking of large, dense heterochromatic regions (which are rich in repeats) could make them insoluble, causing them to be discarded during sample preparation.
        2.  **Signal-to-Noise**: The PFA+DSG method might dramatically increase the "true" signal at promoters and enhancers. This would raise the statistical threshold for peak calling, causing the weaker or more diffuse signals from the repeat regions to fall below the cutoff and thus "disappear" from the final peak list.
    *   **Evaluation**: This hypothesis is strongly supported by the known and specific binding patterns of IKAROS. It explains why a change in protocol would affect one class of binding sites (repeats) differently from another (promoters/enhancers).

### Step 4: Synthesize and Decide
While epitope masking (Hypothesis 1) is a possible artifact, the explanation involving repeats (Hypothesis 2) is more compelling because it is directly tied to the specific, documented behavior of the IKAROS protein. The fact that a major fraction of IKAROS binding occurs at repetitive DNA provides a direct and specific explanation for why a large set of peaks might be systematically lost upon changing the fixation chemistry. The disappearing peaks are most likely those at repetitive elements, which are either lost due to insolubility or are outcompeted by the enhanced signal from true regulatory sites during data analysis.

Therefore, the disappearing peaks are most likely to be found at repeats.
