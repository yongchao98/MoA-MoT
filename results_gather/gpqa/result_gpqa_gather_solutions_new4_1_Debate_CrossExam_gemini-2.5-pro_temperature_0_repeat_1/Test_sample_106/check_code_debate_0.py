    """
    This function checks the correctness of the final answer to the given question.

    The question asks for the MOST CRUCIAL step before proceeding with EXTENSIVE
    in silico docking studies for a complex molecule with multiple chiral centers
    and tautomers.

    The evaluation logic is based on standard principles of structure-based drug discovery:
    1.  **Workflow Sequence**: Steps should follow a logical order (e.g., binding before ADME).
    2.  **Scientific Validity**: The approach should not rely on known flawed assumptions.
    3.  **Risk Mitigation**: The step should effectively de-risk the project, especially before
        committing "extensive" resources.
    4.  **Problem Relevance**: The step must directly address the core challenges mentioned
        (chirality, tautomerism).
