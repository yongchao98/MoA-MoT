    """
    This function checks the correctness of the final answer provided for the exoplanet problem.
    It recalculates the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1
    and compares it to the provided answer.

    The physical principles used are:
    1. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) vs. Orbital Distance (a): T_eq ∝ 1/√a
       This implies the ratio of orbital distances is a_j/a_i = (T_eq_i/T_eq_j)².
    2. Kepler's Third Law: P² ∝ a³
       This implies the ratio of orbital periods is P_j/P_i = (a_j/a_i)^(3/2).
