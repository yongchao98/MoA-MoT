    # 1. Reaction A: The Michael addition of dimethyl malonate enolate to methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate
    # results in the adduct (MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOMe. The correct IUPAC name for this structure,
    # based on a propane backbone, is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.
    correct_A = "trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate"

    # 2. Reaction B: The Stork enamine synthesis involves the Michael addition of an enamine to an
    # acceptor, followed by hydrolysis. The acidic workup (H3O+) ensures the final product is the
    # thermodynamically more stable keto form, not the enol. The correct product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.
    correct_B = "3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile"

    # 3. Reaction C: This is a retrosynthesis. The product, 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, is formed
    # from but-3-en-2-one (the acceptor). The donor (C) must therefore be cyclohexane-1,3-dione, as its
    # C2 proton is highly acidic and readily forms the nucleophilic enolate required for the reaction.
