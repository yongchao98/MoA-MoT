The governing principle is the Born rule of quantum mechanics. For potentially unnormalized vectors, the probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` is given by:\n    `Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n    where `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n\n2.  **Find the Eigenvector for λ = 0**: We need to solve the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`, which simplifies to `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\n    *   Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`.\n    *   The matrix equation is:\n        ```\n        [ 0,   1/√2,  0   ] [x]   [0]\n        [ 1/√2, 0,   1/√2 ] [y] = [0]\n        [ 0,   1/√2,  0   ] [z]   [0]\n        ```\n    *   This yields a system of linear equations:\n        *   From the first and third rows: `(1/√2)y = 0`, which means `y = 0`.\n        *   From the second row: `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0`, which means `x + z = 0`, or `x = -z`.\n    *   The eigenvector is therefore of the form `[k, 0, -k]ᵀ`. We can choose a simple representative by setting `k=1`, giving `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]ᵀ`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Necessary Components**:\n    *   State vector: `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n    *   Eigenvector: `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]ᵀ`\n    *   Inner product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`: `(1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2`.\n    *   Squared magnitude of the inner product `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²`: `(-2)² = 4`.\n    *   Squared norm of the state vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`: `(-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    *   Squared norm of the eigenvector `⟨v₀|v₀⟩`: `(1)² + (0)² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.\n\n4.  **Compute the Final Probability**:\n    *   Substitute the calculated values into the Born rule formula:\n        `Prob(0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Calculation Consensus**: All 15 candidate answers, regardless of their final letter choice, correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the numerical result of **1/3**. This provides extremely high confidence in the mathematical steps.\n*   **Handling Unnormalized Vectors**: A critical aspect of this problem is that the given state vector `|ψ⟩` is not normalized (its squared norm is 6, not 1). The formula `|⟨v|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v|v⟩⟨ψ|ψ⟩)` correctly accounts for this by including the squared norms of both the state vector and the eigenvector in the denominator. This was handled correctly by all agents.\n*   **Eigenvalue Verification**: It is good practice to confirm that 0 is a valid eigenvalue of the operator `P`. The characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0` yields `λ(1-λ²) = 0`, confirming the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. This means a measurement of 0 is a physically possible outcome.\n*   **Mapping to Multiple-Choice Options**: The primary discrepancy among the candidate answers was in mapping the calculated result (`1/3`) to the correct lettered option. This is because the agents were likely working with randomized option lists. The final answer must be based on the specific options provided in the question prompt.\n\nThe calculated probability is **1/3**.

The governing principle is the Born rule of quantum mechanics. For potentially unnormalized vectors, the probability is given by:\n    `Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n    where `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n\n2.  **Find the Eigenvector for λ = 0**: We need to solve the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`, which simplifies to `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\n    Let `|v₀⟩` be the column vector `[x, y, z]ᵀ`.

For potentially unnormalized vectors, the probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` is given by:\n    `Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n    where `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n\n2.  **Find the Eigenvector for λ = 0**: We need to solve the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`, which simplifies to `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\n    *   Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`.\n    *   The matrix equation is:\n        ```\n        [ 0,   1/√2,  0   ] [x]   [0]\n        [ 1/√2, 0,   1/√2 ] [y] = [0]\n        [ 0,   1/√2,  0   ] [z]   [0]\n        ```\n    *   This yields a system of linear equations:\n        *   From the first and third rows: `(1/√2)y = 0`, which means `y = 0`.\n        *   From the second row: `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0`, which means `x + z = 0`, or `x = -z`.\n    *   The eigenvector is therefore of the form `[k, 0, -k]ᵀ`. We can choose a simple representative by setting `k=1`, giving `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]ᵀ`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Necessary Components**:\n    *   State vector: `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n    *   Eigenvector: `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]ᵀ`\n    *   Inner product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`: `(1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2`.\n    *   Squared magnitude of the inner product `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²`: `(-2)² = 4`.\n    *   Squared norm of the state vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`: `(-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    *   Squared norm of the eigenvector `⟨v₀|v₀⟩`: `(1)² + (0)² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.\n\n4.  **Compute the Final Probability**:\n    *   Substitute the calculated values into the Born rule formula:\n        `Prob(0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Calculation Consensus**: All 15 candidate answers, regardless of their final letter choice, correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the numerical result of **1/3**. This provides extremely high confidence in the mathematical steps.\n*   **Handling Unnormalized Vectors**: A critical aspect of this problem is that the given state vector `|ψ⟩` is not normalized (its squared norm is 6, not 1). The formula `|⟨v|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v|v⟩⟨ψ|ψ⟩)` correctly accounts for this by including the squared norms of both the state vector and the eigenvector in the denominator. This was handled correctly by all agents.\n*   **Eigenvalue Verification**: It is good practice to confirm that 0 is a valid eigenvalue of the operator `P`. The characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0` yields `λ(1-λ²) = 0`, confirming the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. This means a measurement of 0 is a physically possible outcome.\n*   **Mapping to Multiple-Choice Options**: The primary discrepancy among the candidate answers was in mapping the calculated result (`1/3`) to the correct lettered option.

This is a standard application of the measurement postulate in quantum mechanics, also known as the Born rule.\n\n**1. Identify the Governing Principle: The Born Rule**\nThe probability, `Prob(λ)`, of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` of an observable `P` for a system in a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector. The general formula, which is valid even for unnormalized vectors, is:\n\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `|ψ⟩` is the state vector of the system: `[-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`.\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector of the operator `P` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product (or dot product) of the two vectors.\n*   `⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩` and `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` are the squared norms of the respective vectors, which serve as normalization factors.\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue λ = 0**\nWe must find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` that corresponds to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`. This is done by solving the equation `P|v₀⟩ = λ|v₀⟩`, which simplifies to `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\n\n*   Given `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]` and let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`.\n*   The matrix equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0` gives the following system of linear equations:\n    1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  ⇒ `y = 0`\n    2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` ⇒ `x + z = 0` ⇒ `x = -z`\n*   The eigenvector is of the form `[k, 0, -k]ᵀ` for any non-zero constant `k`. We can choose a simple, unnormalized representative by setting `k=1`, which gives `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]ᵀ`.\n\n**3.

This provides extremely high confidence in the correctness of the mathematical procedure.\n2.  **Handling of Unnormalized Vectors:** The given state vector `|ψ⟩` is not normalized, as its squared norm is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 6`, not 1. This is a critical detail. The calculation must account for this, which the general formula `|⟨v|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v|v⟩⟨ψ|ψ⟩)` does perfectly. Failing to account for normalization is a common and significant error in these types of problems.\n3.  **Eigenvalue Verification:** It is good practice to first confirm that the measurement outcome (0) is a valid eigenvalue of the operator `P`. Solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0` gives `λ(1 - λ²) = 0`, confirming the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.
