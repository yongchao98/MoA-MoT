The key is to understand the specific transformation occurring at each step.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   This is an **α-halogenation** of a ketone. A hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is substituted by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical step. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under these conditions triggers a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This is a specific named reaction that results in a **ring contraction** for cyclic ketones.\n    *   **Product 2:** The six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring, forming **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂), Pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   This is a standard laboratory procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive **acyl chloride**.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Reaction 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of reducing agent is crucial. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to **aldehydes**, preventing over-reduction to the corresponding alcohol (which would occur with a stronger reagent like LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### **Step 2: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, which corresponds to the number of unique signals expected in a ¹H NMR spectrum. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** Protons on the same CH₂ group are not necessarily equivalent. If they have different spatial relationships to other parts of the molecule (like the aldehyde group), they are **diastereotopic** and thus chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the unique sets of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic (one is *cis* to the aldehyde group, one is *trans*). The two *cis* protons are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set. This gives **2 more types** of hydrogens.\n4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** The same logic applies. The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent, but the two protons on each carbon are also diastereotopic. This results in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Matching this result with the given options:\nA) 8\nB) 10\nC) 6\nD) 7\n\nThe calculated number is 6, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the chemical reactions and the structure of the final product, here is a step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe problem describes a four-step synthesis. Correctly identifying the product of each step is crucial.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is substituted by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical step. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under these conditions triggers a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This is a specific named reaction that must be recognized. A common mistake would be to assume a simple substitution or elimination reaction.\n    *   For cyclic ketones, the Favorskii rearrangement results in a **ring contraction**. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂), Pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   This is a standard laboratory procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Reaction 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of the reducing agent is key. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reagent. Unlike a stronger reagent like LiAlH₄, it selectively reduces acyl chlorides to **aldehydes**, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### **Step 2: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, which corresponds to the number of unique signals that would appear in a ¹H NMR spectrum. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the ring, making C2 equivalent to C5, and C3 equivalent to C4.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Hydrogens on the same carbon are not necessarily equivalent. We must consider their stereochemical relationship to other parts of the molecule. Protons on a CH₂ group that are in different environments are called **diastereotopic** and are chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments:\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is bonded to the carbonyl carbon and is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. It is the only methine proton on the ring and lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. One is *cis* to the aldehyde group and one is *trans*. The two *cis* protons are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set. This gives two more distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic, giving another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

I will analyze each reaction, noting the key transformations and reagents. The most critical steps are the Favorskii rearrangement, which involves a ring contraction, and the selective reduction of the acyl chloride to an aldehyde.\n\nOnce the structure of Product 4 is determined, I will analyze its symmetry to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

A correct identification of each product is essential to determine the final structure.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is substituted by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n    *   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction occurs with α-halo ketones that have an available proton on the other α-carbon.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical step in the sequence. It is not a simple substitution or elimination reaction. For cyclic ketones, this rearrangement results in a **ring contraction**. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid functional group (after an implied workup).\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard laboratory procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Reaction 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This step involves the reduction of the acyl chloride.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of reducing agent is key. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to **aldehydes**, preventing over-reduction to the corresponding alcohol (which would occur with a stronger reagent like LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### **Step 2: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry, as chemically distinct hydrogens would give rise to separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule has a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). On the NMR timescale, due to rapid conformational changes, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, bonded to a carbonyl carbon.

This is a **2nd type**.\n    3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are not chemically equivalent to each other due to their different spatial relationships (one is *cis* and one is *trans*) with the aldehyde group. Therefore, the four hydrogens on C2 and C5 are divided into two distinct sets of two equivalent hydrogens each. This gives **2 more types**.\n    4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent.

Chemically distinct hydrogens are those in non-equivalent environments, which would produce separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule has a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).

A hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is substituted by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming product 2.**\n    *   **Reaction:** These conditions—an α-halo ketone with a strong base—are characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical transformation in the sequence. It is not a simple substitution or elimination reaction. The Favorskii rearrangement in cyclic systems like this results in a **ring contraction**, where the six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine, forming product 3.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard laboratory procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a selective reduction of an acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of reducing agent is crucial. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reagent. Unlike a stronger reagent like LiAlH₄ (which would produce an alcohol), it selectively reduces acyl chlorides to the aldehyde stage and stops.\n\n### **Part 2: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, which corresponds to the number of unique signals that would appear in a ¹H NMR spectrum. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the ring, making the carbons on one side equivalent to the carbons on the other (C2 is equivalent to C5; C3 is equivalent to C4).\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is bonded to a carbonyl carbon and is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1 type**.\n    2.  **The C1 Proton:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. It is the only methine (CH) proton on the ring and lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **2nd type**.\n    3.  **The C2 and C5 Protons:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. They are not chemically equivalent because they have different spatial relationships to the aldehyde group (one is *cis* and the other is *trans*). The two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set. This gives **2 more types**.\n    4.  **The C3 and C4 Protons:** The same logic applies. The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent, but the two protons on each carbon are also diastereotopic. This results in another **2 distinct types**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to assume that two protons on the same CH₂ group are always equivalent. In a chiral or prochiral molecule like this, they are often diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms gives:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

Correctly identifying each intermediate and the final product is crucial.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is substituted by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** The treatment of an α-halo ketone with a strong base triggers a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical step. For cyclic α-halo ketones, this reaction results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone becomes a five-membered cyclopentane ring. Mistaking this for a simple substitution or elimination reaction would lead to an incorrect final structure.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂), Pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard laboratory procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a selective reduction of an acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of reducing agent is key. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent.

The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, which corresponds to the number of unique signals that would appear in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule has a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). On the NMR timescale, due to rapid conformational changes, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** Hydrogens on the same carbon are not necessarily equivalent. If they have different spatial relationships to other parts of the molecule (e.g., one is *cis* and one is *trans* to a substituent), they are considered **diastereotopic** and are chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the unique sets of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, bonded to a carbonyl carbon. This is **1 type**.\n2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique.

The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, which corresponds to the number of unique signals that would appear in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule has a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Symmetry):** Due to rapid conformational changes, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry on the NMR timescale. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Diastereotopicity):** Protons on the same CH₂ group are not necessarily equivalent. If they have different spatial relationships to other parts of the molecule (like the aldehyde group), they are considered diastereotopic and are chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments based on these principles:\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, bonded to a carbonyl carbon. This is **1 type**.\n2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **2nd type**.\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. One is *cis* to the aldehyde group and one is *trans*. The two *cis* protons are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set. This gives **2 more types** of hydrogens.\n4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic, resulting in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens.\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

A hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is substituted by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a substitution reaction at the α-carbon, not an addition reaction to the C=O double bond. This step sets up the molecule for the critical subsequent reaction.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n    *   **Analysis:** The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under heat triggers a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most crucial transformation in the sequence. It is essential to recognize these specific conditions and not mistake the reaction for a simple substitution or elimination. The Favorskii rearrangement in cyclic systems like this leads to a **ring contraction**, where the six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard laboratory procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a straightforward functional group transformation. Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct, driving the reaction to completion.\n\n*   **Reaction 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a selective reduction of an acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of reducing agent is critical. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reagent. Unlike a stronger reagent like LiAlH₄ (which would produce an alcohol), it selectively reduces acyl chlorides to the aldehyde stage and stops the reaction.\n\n### **Step 2: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, which corresponds to the number of unique signals expected in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must consider that hydrogens on the same carbon atom are not necessarily equivalent. If they have different spatial relationships to other parts of the molecule (like the aldehyde group), they are considered **diastereotopic** and are chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the unique sets of hydrogen atoms based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, bonded to a carbonyl carbon. This is **1 type**.\n2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **2nd type**.\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This is because one is *cis* to the aldehyde group and one is *trans*. The two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set.

It is not a simple substitution or elimination reaction. For cyclic ketones, the Favorskii rearrangement results in a **ring contraction**. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine, forming product 3.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard laboratory procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride.

A correct identification of each product is essential to determine the final structure.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is substituted by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n    *   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction occurs with α-halo ketones that have an available proton on the other α-carbon.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical step in the sequence. It is not a simple substitution or elimination reaction. For cyclic ketones, this rearrangement results in a **ring contraction**. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid functional group (after an implied workup).\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard laboratory procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Reaction 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This step involves the reduction of the acyl chloride.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of reducing agent is key. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to **aldehydes**, preventing over-reduction to the corresponding alcohol (which would occur with a stronger reagent like LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### **Step 2: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry, as chemically distinct hydrogens would give rise to separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule has a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). On the NMR timescale, due to rapid conformational changes, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, bonded to a carbonyl carbon. This is **1 type**.\n    2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **2nd type**.\n    3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are not chemically equivalent to each other due to their different spatial relationships (one is *cis* and one is *trans*) with the aldehyde group. Therefore, the four hydrogens on C2 and C5 are divided into two distinct sets of two equivalent hydrogens each. This gives **2 more types**.\n    4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming product 2.**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is the most critical step. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under heat is the classic condition for a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is not a simple elimination or substitution reaction. The Favorskii rearrangement mechanism for cyclic ketones results in a **ring contraction**. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone becomes a five-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine, forming product 3.**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a standard and efficient laboratory method for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃), forming product 4.**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a selective reduction reaction.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of reducing agent is key. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild and sterically hindered reagent. Unlike stronger agents like LiAlH₄, it selectively reduces acyl chlorides to aldehydes and stops the reaction at that stage, preventing over-reduction to the corresponding alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### **Part 2: Structural Analysis of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry. Chemically distinct hydrogens are those in non-equivalent environments, which would produce separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule has a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). Due to rapid conformational changes (ring flipping) at room temperature, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry on the NMR timescale. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, bonded to a carbonyl carbon. This is **1 type**.\n    2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. It is the only methine proton on the ring and lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **2nd type**.\n    3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are not equivalent to each other because they have different spatial relationships to the aldehyde group (one is *cis*, one is *trans*). The two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set. This gives **2 more types** of hydrogens.\n    4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** The same logic applies. The plane of symmetry makes carbons C3 and C4 equivalent, but the two protons on each carbon are also diastereotopic. This results in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.

The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, which corresponds to the number of unique signals that would appear in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Careful Point:** To correctly count the distinct hydrogens, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry and consider the concept of diastereotopicity. Due to rapid ring flipping, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry on the NMR timescale. This plane passes through the aldehyde group and the ring carbon it is attached to (C1).\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1 type**.\n2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **2nd type**.\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are not chemically equivalent to each other because of their different spatial relationships (*cis* vs. *trans*) to the aldehyde group. The two *cis* protons are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set.
