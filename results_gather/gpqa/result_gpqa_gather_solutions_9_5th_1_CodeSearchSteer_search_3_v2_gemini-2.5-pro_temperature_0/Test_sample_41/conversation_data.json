This requires calculating the ratio `P3 / P1`.\n\n2.  **Identify Relevant Physical Principles:** The solution requires linking the given information about equilibrium temperatures to orbital periods. This is achieved by combining two fundamental laws of astrophysics:\n    *   **The Law of Planetary Equilibrium Temperature:** This law relates a planet's temperature to its distance from its star.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period to its orbital distance.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Physical Relationships:**\n    *   **Temperature vs. Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star with an identical albedo, the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (`a`).\n        *   **Law:** `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`\n    *   **Period vs. Distance:** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance (`a`).\n        *   **Law:** `P² ∝ a³`, which can be rewritten as `P ∝ a^(3/2)`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Principles to Find a Direct Relationship:** The most efficient way to solve the problem is to derive a single relationship that directly connects the orbital period (`P`) to the equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`).\n    *   From the temperature law, we can express the orbital distance as `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n    *   Substitute this expression for `a` into Kepler's Law: `P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2)`.\n    *   Simplifying the exponents gives the final, direct relationship: `P ∝ 1/T_eq³`.\n    *   This means the ratio of the periods is the inverse cube of the ratio of the temperatures: `P_j / P_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)³`.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, we need the overall temperature ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3 (`T_eq1 / T_eq3`). We find this by multiplying the given intermediate ratios:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`.\n    *   Now, we use the relationship from Step 4 to find the period ratio `P3 / P1`:\n        `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³ = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated factor is approximately **33.4**.

The irrelevant data includes:\n    *   The **ratio of the masses** between the planets.\n    *   The specific **albedo value of 0.3**. The crucial fact is that the albedo is *equal* for all three planets, which allows it to cancel out when using ratios.\n    *   The mention of the **TTV discovery method**, which is simply background context.\n\n*   **Distractor Options:** The incorrect options are cleverly designed to match intermediate results from the calculation, which can trap someone who stops the calculation prematurely.\n    *   **Option C (~3.2)** corresponds to the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3`, which is the first step of the calculation.\n    *   **Option D (~10.4)** corresponds to the ratio of the orbital distances `a3 / a1`, which is another intermediate step calculated as `(T_eq1 / T_eq3)² ≈ (3.22)² ≈ 10.4`.\n\n*   **Correct Exponents:** The solution is critically dependent on the correct application of the exponents in the two physical laws (`T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)` and `P ∝ a^(3/2)`) and combining them correctly to get the final relationship `P ∝ T_eq⁻³`.\n\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** There is a unanimous consensus among all 15 candidate answers on the physical principles, the step-by-step calculation, and the final numerical result of approximately 33.4.

For planets orbiting the same star with an identical albedo, the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (`a`).\n        *   **Law:** `T_eq ∝ 1/√a` or `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n    *   **Period vs. Distance:** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance (`a`).\n        *   **Law:** `P² ∝ a³`, which can be rewritten as `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n\n4.  **Combine the Laws for a Direct Relationship:** To solve the problem efficiently, we can derive a single relationship that directly connects the orbital period (`P`) to the equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`).\n    *   From the temperature law, we can express the orbital distance as `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n    *   Substitute this expression for `a` into Kepler's Law: `P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2)`.\n    *   Simplifying the exponents gives the final, direct relationship: `P ∝ 1/T_eq³`.\n    *   This means the ratio of the periods is the inverse cube of the ratio of the temperatures: `P_j / P_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)³`.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, we need the overall temperature ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3 (`T_eq1 / T_eq3`). This is found by multiplying the given ratios:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`.\n    *   Now, we use the combined relationship from Step 4 to find the period ratio `P3 / P1`:\n        `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³ = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1 by a factor of approximately **33.4**.

For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance (`a`).\n        *   **Physical Law:** `P² ∝ a³`, which can be rewritten as `P ∝ a^(3/2)`.\n\n3.  **Combine the Physical Laws:** To solve the problem efficiently, a single relationship between the orbital period (`P`) and the equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) must be derived.\n    *   From the temperature law, we can express the orbital distance as `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n    *   Substitute this expression for `a` into Kepler's Third Law: `P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2)`.\n    *   Simplifying the exponents gives the final, direct relationship: `P ∝ 1/T_eq³`.\n    *   This means the ratio of the periods is the inverse cube of the ratio of the temperatures: `P_j / P_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)³`.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   We need to find the ratio `P3 / P1`, which is equal to `(T_eq1 / T_eq3)³`.\n    *   First, we must find the overall temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` by multiplying the given intermediate ratios:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`.\n    *   Now, we cube this value to find the period ratio:\n        `P3 / P1 = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1 by a factor of approximately **33.4**. Comparing this to the provided options, the result matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem deliberately includes information that is not needed for the calculation to test for a solid understanding of the underlying principles. All candidate answers correctly identified this. The irrelevant data includes:\n    *   The **ratio of the masses** between the planets.\n    *   The specific **albedo value of 0.3**. The only crucial fact is that the albedo is *equal* for all three planets, which allows it to cancel out when using ratios.\n    *   The mention of the **TTV discovery method**, which is simply background context.\n\n*   **Distractor Options:** The incorrect options are cleverly designed to match intermediate results of the calculation, which can trap someone who stops the calculation prematurely.\n    *   The value **~3.2** (Option A) corresponds to the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (`T_eq1 / T_eq3`), which is an intermediate step.\n    *   The value **~10.4** (Option D) corresponds to the ratio of the orbital distances (`a3 / a1`), which is another intermediate step calculated as `(T_eq1 / T_eq3)² ≈ (3.22)² ≈ 10.4`.\n\n*   **Correct Exponents:** The solution is critically dependent on the correct application and combination of the exponents in the two physical laws: `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)` and `P ∝ a^(3/2)`. Combining these correctly to get the final relationship `P ∝ T_eq⁻³` is the key to solving the problem.\n\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** There is a unanimous consensus among all 15 candidate answers on the physical principles, the step-by-step calculation, and the final numerical result of approximately 33.4. The inconsistencies in the final letter choice across the different answers are an artifact of those systems being presented with shuffled option lists and should be disregarded.

This requires calculating the ratio `P3 / P1`.\n\n2.  **Identify Relevant Physical Principles:** The solution requires combining two fundamental laws of astrophysics:\n    *   **Planetary Equilibrium Temperature:** This law relates a planet's temperature to its distance from its star.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period to its orbital distance.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Physical Relationships:**\n    *   **Temperature vs. Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the relationship is `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`, where `a` is the orbital distance.\n    *   **Period vs. Distance:** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance (`a`). This gives the relationship `P² ∝ a³`, which can be rewritten as `P ∝ a^(3/2)`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Laws:** To solve the problem efficiently, a single formula directly relating the orbital period to the equilibrium temperature can be derived.\n    *   From the temperature law, we can express the orbital distance as `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n    *   Substitute this expression for `a` into Kepler's Law: `P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2)`.\n    *   Simplifying the exponents gives the final relationship: `P ∝ 1/T_eq³`.\n    *   This means the ratio of the periods is the inverse cube of the ratio of the temperatures: `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³`.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the overall temperature ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3 by multiplying the given ratios:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`.\n    *   Next, cube this result to find the final period ratio:\n        `P3 / P1 = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated factor is approximately **33.4**.
