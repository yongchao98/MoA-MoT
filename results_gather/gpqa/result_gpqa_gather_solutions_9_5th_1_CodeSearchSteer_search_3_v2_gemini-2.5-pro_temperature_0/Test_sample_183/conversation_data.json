Deconstruction of the Goal**\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Constraint:** The synthesis should be \"high-yield\".\n*   **Task:** Evaluate the four provided reaction sequences and select the only one that is chemically viable.\n\n### **2. Careful Points for Analysis**\n\n1.  **Target Molecule Structure:** The product is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) benzene ring. The substituents are a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu), an ethoxy group (-OEt), and a nitro group (-NO₂). The adjacent placement of these groups, especially the bulky -tBu group, presents a significant synthetic challenge.\n2.  **The \"High-Yield\" Constraint:** The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but its large size sterically hinders substitution at the adjacent *ortho* positions. Therefore, any standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will overwhelmingly favor the *para* product. A pathway that relies on separating the minor *ortho* isomer cannot be considered high-yield. This creates a conflict between achieving the correct structure and achieving a high yield, meaning we must prioritize chemical possibility over efficiency.\n3.  **Identification of Fatal Flaws:** The most effective method to solve this problem is to identify chemically impossible or nonsensical steps in the proposed sequences. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option. Common flaws to look for include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation on a Deactivated Ring or Aniline:** Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on rings that are strongly deactivated (e.g., by a nitro group) or on aniline itself, because the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amino group.\n    *   **Reactions on Unstable Intermediates:** Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt is not a viable reaction.\n    *   **Illogical Reaction Order:** Attempting a reaction on a functional group before it has been created (e.g., performing a diazotization before the corresponding amine has been formed).\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This reaction is not feasible. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n    *   This sequence is written in a confusing and illogical order.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (iv) `NaNO₂/HCl` is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine. However, the amine-forming step (`Fe/HCl`) does not occur until much later at step (viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is chemically impossible due to an illogical reaction order.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable intermediate.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis) and would decompose under the harsh conditions of nitration.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   This is the only remaining option. By elimination, it must be the correct choice. Let's analyze its pathway to confirm:\n        1.  **i) Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **ii) Nitration:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho* isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **iv) Nitration:** In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a valid and regioselective step.\n        5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol. (Valid)\n        7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether product. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy elimination, Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step (ii), Option A is the only viable choice. In a multiple-choice format, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route must be selected over impossible ones.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo decide the final answer, a systematic analysis of each proposed reaction sequence is necessary. The evaluation must focus on chemical feasibility, regioselectivity (the directing effects of substituents), and steric hindrance.\n\n### **Careful Points for Analysis**\n\n1.  **Target Molecule Structure:** The goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents. The relative positions are critical: the ethoxy and nitro groups are both *ortho* to the tert-butyl group.\n\n2.  **Steric Hindrance of the tert-Butyl Group:** The tert-butyl (-tBu) group is exceptionally bulky. This size creates significant steric hindrance, which makes chemical reactions at the adjacent *ortho* positions very difficult. Any standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (like nitration) on tert-butylbenzene will overwhelmingly favor substitution at the distant *para* position.\n\n3.  **The \"High-Yield\" Constraint:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This is a crucial but potentially misleading constraint. Given the steric hindrance of the tert-butyl group, any pathway that relies on separating the minor *ortho*-substituted product from the major *para*-substituted product cannot be considered high-yield. Therefore, the primary goal must be to find a sequence that is **chemically possible**, even if it is not efficient. An impossible reaction sequence can never be the correct answer.\n\n4.  **Elimination of Impossible Reactions:** The most effective strategy is to identify and eliminate any sequences that contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Common fatal flaws include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Reactions on Anilines:** The Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation or acylation.\n    *   **Reactions on Unstable Intermediates:** Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt is not a viable reaction.\n    *   **Illogical Reaction Order:** Attempting a reaction on a functional group before it has been created (e.g., performing a diazotization before the corresponding amine has been formed).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option as presented in the question for fatal flaws.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine. However, the product after step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. The reaction is attempted on the wrong functional group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts to perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction does not work because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt that was formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. They would decompose under the harsh reaction conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-isomers. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho*-isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), a *meta*-director. The -tBu group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The core synthesis (steps i-vii) is chemically sound and is the only one that leads to the named product. The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the correct synthesis that has already been completed.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy the process of elimination, Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option C is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step, Option C is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices and must be the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Goal and Target Molecule\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n*   **Structural Analysis:** The target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director. Its most important characteristic is its large size, which creates significant steric hindrance.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Primary Synthetic Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. Introducing a group *ortho* to the very bulky tert-butyl group via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution is difficult and typically a low-yield process. This immediately brings the \"high-yield\" constraint into question, suggesting it might be a distractor or that we must choose the *most* plausible route, not necessarily a perfect one.\n\n### 2. Systematically Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nThe most effective strategy is to identify any chemically impossible or nonsensical steps in each sequence. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Analyze Option B.**\n    *   The sequence is `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This option is nonsensically written with duplicate step numbers. More importantly, step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). The substrate at this point in the synthesis is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, not an amine. Therefore, this step is impossible.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Analyze Option C.**\n    *   The sequence is `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction is impossible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Analyze Option D.**\n    *   The sequence is `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt, which was formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis), not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. They would decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Analyze Option A.**\n    *   By elimination, this is the only remaining possibility. We must verify its chemical logic.\n    *   The sequence is `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho* isomer**. This step is chemically possible but contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition.\n    3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (This is a valid and regioselective step).\n    5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`. (Valid)\n    6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nBy the process of elimination, Options B, C, and D are fundamentally flawed because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical reaction steps. Option A is the only sequence that is chemically plausible from start to finish and leads to the correctly named target molecule. Although the synthesis described in Option A is not truly \"high-yield\" because it relies on the separation of a minor isomer in an early step, it is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route must be selected over routes that are chemically impossible.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided reaction sequences to determine the correct synthesis pathway.\n\n    The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n    Analysis of Options:\n    - Option A: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 -> ii) HNO3/H2SO4 -> iii) Fe/HCl -> iv) HNO3/H2SO4 -> v) NaNO2/HCl -> vi) H3O+/Heat -> vii) NaOH/EtBr.\n      This sequence is chemically plausible.\n      i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation: Forms tert-butylbenzene.

Deconstruct the Question and Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n*   **Structural Analysis:** The target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring:\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director. Its large size creates significant steric hindrance.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n\n### **2. Identify Key Synthetic Challenges and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Steric Hindrance.** The primary challenge is the bulky tert-butyl group. Placing substituents at positions 1 and 3 (both *ortho* to the -tBu group) via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is difficult. Any direct EAS on tert-butylbenzene will heavily favor substitution at the *para* position.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"High-Yield\" Constraint.** This constraint is in direct conflict with the steric reality of forming the target molecule. Any pathway that relies on separating a minor *ortho*-substituted isomer from a major *para*-substituted isomer cannot be considered high-yield. However, in a multiple-choice question, the most critical task is to find a *chemically possible* route, as other options may be chemically impossible.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Identifying Fatal Flaws.** The most efficient way to solve this problem is to eliminate any sequence that contains a chemically impossible or nonsensical step. Common fatal flaws include:\n    *   Attempting a Friedel-Crafts reaction on a strongly deactivated ring or on aniline.\n    *   Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt.\n    *   Following an illogical reaction order (e.g., performing a reaction on a functional group before it has been created).\n\n### **3.

(Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The core synthesis (steps i-vii) is chemically sound and is the only one that leads to the named product.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy the process of elimination, Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option B is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step, Option B is the only viable choice. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route must be selected over routes that are chemically impossible.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Goal\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Constraint:** The synthesis should be \"high-yield\".\n\n### 2. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Steric Hindrance.** The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky. This creates significant steric hindrance, making it very difficult to introduce new substituents at the adjacent *ortho* positions (in this case, positions 1 and 3 relative to the tert-butyl group).\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"High-Yield\" Constraint.** Standard electrophilic aromatic substitution on tert-butylbenzene heavily favors substitution at the distant *para* position to avoid steric clash. Any pathway that requires substitution *ortho* to the tert-butyl group will likely be a low-yield process. In a multiple-choice question, chemical possibility must take precedence over the yield claim if other options are impossible.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\nThe most effective method is to identify any chemically impossible or nonsensical steps in each sequence. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is nonsensically written with typos and duplicate step numbers. It attempts a diazotization reaction (`iv) NaNO2/HCl`) before the necessary amine has been formed (`viii) Fe/HCl`). This is chemically illogical.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction is impossible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (formed in step v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. They would decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the only sequence that does not contain a fatal chemical flaw. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor ortho isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv (Careful Point 3: Regioselectivity):** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a valid and regioselective step.\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBy elimination, Options A, B, and C are definitively incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical reaction steps. Option D is the only sequence that is chemically plausible and leads to the correctly named target molecule. Although the synthesis is not truly \"high-yield\" because it relies on the separation of a minor isomer in an early step, it is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices. In the context of a multiple-choice question, the only possible route must be selected over the impossible ones.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a rigorous, step-by-step analysis of each option is required. The most effective method is to identify chemically impossible steps to eliminate incorrect options.\n\n### **Careful Points of Analysis**\n\n1.  **Target Molecule Structure:** The product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) benzene ring. The substituents are a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu), an ethoxy group (-OEt), and a nitro group (-NO₂). The adjacent placement of these groups, especially the bulky -tBu group, presents a significant synthetic challenge.\n\n2.  **The \"High-Yield\" Constraint:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but its large size sterically hinders substitution at the adjacent *ortho* positions. Therefore, any standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will overwhelmingly favor the *para* product. A pathway that relies on separating the minor *ortho* isomer cannot be considered high-yield. However, in a multiple-choice question, a chemically *possible* route must be chosen over chemically *impossible* routes, even if it has low-yield steps.\n\n3.  **Identification of Fatal Flaws:** The most effective way to solve this problem is to identify sequences that contain chemically impossible steps. Common flaws to look for include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts reactions on anilines:** The Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation or acylation.\n    *   **Reactions on unstable intermediates:** Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt is not a viable reaction.\n    *   **Illogical reaction order:** Attempting a reaction (e.g., diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl) before the necessary functional group (a primary amine) has been formed.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **Option A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This reaction is not feasible. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is written in a confusing and illogical order. Step (iv) calls for diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine. However, at this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed. A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v) and then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable intermediate in step (vi). Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis) and would decompose under the harsh conditions of nitration.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   This is the only remaining option. By elimination, it must be the correct choice. Let's verify its chemical plausibility:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a valid, regioselective step.\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final ethoxy ether product. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is the only one that is chemically plausible and leads to the target molecule.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy the process of elimination, Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option B is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step (ii), Option B is the only viable choice among the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Goal**\nThe objective is to identify the single correct sequence of reactions from the provided options that results in the **high-yield** synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, starting from benzene.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Steric Hindrance.** The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky. This creates significant steric hindrance, making it very difficult to introduce new substituents at the adjacent *ortho* positions (in this case, positions 1 and 3 relative to the tert-butyl group).\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"High-Yield\" Conflict.** Standard electrophilic aromatic substitution on tert-butylbenzene heavily favors substitution at the distant *para* position to avoid steric clash. Any pathway that requires substitution *ortho* to the tert-butyl group will likely be a low-yield process. This creates a conflict with the \"high-yield\" requirement in the question. Therefore, the primary criterion for selecting an answer must be chemical feasibility over theoretical yield.\n\n### **3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nThe most effective method is to eliminate any sequence that contains a chemically impossible or nonsensical step.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence is written with duplicate step numbers and is in an illogical order. It attempts a diazotization reaction (`iv) NaNO2/HCl`) long before the necessary amine is formed (`viii) Fe/HCl`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible due to an illogical reaction order.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (`vi) HNO3/H2SO4` immediately after forming one in step `v`).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis), not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. They would decompose under these harsh conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence fails at step (iii), where it attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) required for Friedel-Crafts reactions reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n### **4. Detailed Analysis of the Plausible Option**\n\nBy elimination, Option B is the only remaining choice. We must verify its chemical logic.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    This sequence is the only one without a fatal chemical flaw. Let's trace the pathway:\n    1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor ortho isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n    3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **Careful Point 3: Regioselectivity.** In step (iv), the nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline occurs. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is a valid and regioselective step.\n    5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol. (Valid)\n    7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are definitively incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option B is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible series of transformations that successfully produces the target molecule. Although the synthesis is not truly \"high-yield\" due to the poor regioselectivity in step (ii), it is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices. In a multiple-choice question, the chemically possible route must be selected over the impossible ones.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo decide the final answer, a systematic analysis of each proposed reaction sequence is necessary. The most effective strategy is to first eliminate any options that contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. The single remaining option must be the correct one, even if it has practical limitations.\n\n### Careful Points of Analysis\n\n1.  **Fatal Flaws**: The quickest way to solve this problem is to identify fatal flaws in the reaction sequences. Common flaws to look for include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Reactions on Deactivated Rings/Anilines**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene) and on anilines, as the Lewis acid catalyst complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Reactions on Unstable Intermediates**: Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt is not a viable reaction. Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions.\n    *   **Illogical Reaction Order**: Attempting a reaction on a functional group before it has been created (e.g., performing a diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl before the corresponding amine has been formed via reduction).\n\n2.  **The \"High-Yield\" Conflict**: The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. However, the target molecule has a substituent *ortho* to a very bulky tert-butyl group. Any standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will overwhelmingly favor the *para* product to minimize steric hindrance. This means any pathway relying on the separation of the minor *ortho* isomer cannot be truly high-yield. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically *possible* (even if inefficient) route must be chosen over chemically *impossible* routes.\n\n3.  **Regiochemistry and Directing Effects**: The order of reactions is critical. The directing effects of substituents (ortho, para vs. meta) must be correctly utilized to place the groups in the required 1,2,3-pattern. A key step often involves modifying a functional group (e.g., -NO₂ to -NH₂) to change its directing effect for the next step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation of Options\n\nBased on the options provided in the prompt, we can analyze each one for chemical feasibility.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.

Deconstruct the Goal and Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n*   **Structural Analysis:** The target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy) at C1:** A strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl) at C2:** A weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Its most critical feature is its large size, which creates significant steric hindrance at the adjacent positions (C1 and C3).\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro) at C3:** A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n### **2. Identify the Core Synthetic Challenges and Strategy**\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The primary challenge is installing substituents at positions 1 and 3, which are both *ortho* to the extremely bulky tert-butyl group. A standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) on tert-butylbenzene, such as nitration, will overwhelmingly favor substitution at the *para* position to minimize steric clash.\n*   **The \"High-Yield\" Paradox:** The steric hindrance problem directly conflicts with the \"high-yield\" constraint. This suggests that the question may be flawed, and the primary task is to find the *only chemically possible* route, even if one step is inefficient.\n*   **Strategy:** The most effective way to solve this problem is to use a process of elimination. We will examine each proposed sequence for fatal chemical flaws, such as impossible reactions or an illogical order of steps. A single such flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n### **3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nWe will analyze each option as written in the question prompt.\n\n*   **Option A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is chemically nonsensical. After the initial t-butylation (i) and nitration (ii), it attempts a sulfonation (iii). The correct path would require reduction of the nitro group. Furthermore, it attempts a diazotization (iv) before the required amine is formed (viii).

It correctly forms aniline in steps (i) and (ii), but then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.

(Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-isomers. To proceed, the minor **ortho-isomer** must be isolated. This step is chemically possible but is not high-yield.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine using Fe/HCl, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an *o,p*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.

(Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (NaOH) and ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The sequence of reactions is chemically sound and is the only one that leads to the target molecule.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option C is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step (ii), Option C is the only viable choice. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route must be chosen over impossible ones.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky. This creates significant steric hindrance, making it very difficult to introduce new substituents at the adjacent *ortho* positions (positions 1 and 3 relative to the tert-butyl group).\n2.  **The \"High-Yield\" Constraint:** Standard electrophilic aromatic substitution on tert-butylbenzene heavily favors substitution at the distant *para* position to avoid steric clash. Any pathway that requires substitution *ortho* to the tert-butyl group will likely be a low-yield process. This creates a potential conflict with the \"high-yield\" requirement in the question. The correct answer must be chemically possible above all else.\n3.  **Regioselectivity:** The order of introducing the three different functional groups is critical to ensure they end up in the correct 1,2,3-pattern. The directing effects of the substituents must be carefully managed at each step.\n\n### **Step 2: Systematic Elimination of Chemically Impossible Options**\n\nThe most effective strategy is to identify and eliminate any proposed sequences that contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence correctly forms aniline in steps (i) and (ii). However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v) and then attempts to nitrate it in step (vi).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis). They are not suitable substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration and would decompose under the harsh reaction conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** At this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed. A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n### **Step 3: Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Viable Option**\n\nBy elimination, Option B is the only remaining possibility. We must verify its chemical logic.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho* isomer**. This step is chemically possible but contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition.\n    3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (This is a valid and regioselective step).\n    5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO₂/HCl`. (Valid)\n    6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are definitively incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical reaction steps. Option B is the only sequence that is chemically plausible from start to finish and leads to the correctly named target molecule. Although the synthesis described in Option B is not truly \"high-yield\" because it relies on the separation of a minor isomer in an early step, it is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices. In a multiple-choice question, the chemically possible route must be selected over the impossible ones.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Goal**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n*   **Task:** Evaluate the four provided reaction sequences (A, B, C, D) and select the only one that is chemically plausible.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges**\n\nThe target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring. This presents several challenges:\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl group (-tBu) is exceptionally bulky. This makes any reaction at the adjacent (*ortho*) positions (C1 and C3 relative to the t-Bu group) sterically hindered and therefore difficult.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** The order of reactions is critical to ensure the substituents are placed in the correct 1,2,3-pattern. The directing effects of the groups must be carefully managed.\n*   **The \"High-Yield\" Conflict:** A standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene, such as nitration, will overwhelmingly favor substitution at the distant *para* position to avoid steric clash. Any pathway that relies on separating the minor *ortho*-substituted isomer cannot be considered high-yield. This is a critical point: in a multiple-choice question, a sequence that is chemically *possible* but inefficient must be chosen over sequences that are chemically *impossible*.\n\n### **3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nThe most effective method is to eliminate any sequence that contains a chemically impossible or nonsensical step.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This reaction is not feasible. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a positively charged, strongly deactivated ring that prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable intermediate.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis) and would decompose under the harsh conditions of nitration. They are not suitable substrates for further electrophilic substitution.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence is written with confusing numbering. It attempts a diazotization reaction (`iv) NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** At this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed. The reaction is attempted on the wrong functional group in an illogical order.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** By elimination, this is the only potentially correct answer. Let's trace the pathway to confirm its validity.\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho* isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** Reduction of the nitro group yields **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **Step v:** Diazotization of the amino group forms a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The core synthesis (i-vii) is chemically sound and is the only one that leads to the named product. The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the correct synthesis.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy systematically eliminating the impossible options (A, B, and C), Option D remains as the only chemically viable pathway. The conflict with the \"high-yield\" condition is a common feature in such questions, designed to test the ability to prioritize chemical possibility over stated yield when all other options are fundamentally flawed.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo decide the final answer, a systematic analysis of the chemical problem is required, synthesizing the reasoning presented in the candidate answers and focusing on the most critical aspects of the synthesis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Goal and Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n\nThe target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO₂). The primary challenge is installing these groups in the correct 1,2,3-pattern, especially given the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group.\n\n**2. Careful Points to Consider**\n\nBased on a consensus analysis of the provided answers, the following points are critical:\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky. This property is the most significant factor in the synthesis, as it sterically hinders reactions at the adjacent *ortho* positions. Any direct electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will overwhelmingly favor substitution at the distant *para* position.\n*   **The \"High-Yield\" Contradiction:** The question's requirement for a \"high-yield\" synthesis is in direct conflict with the chemical reality of the target molecule. Any pathway that requires substitution *ortho* to the tert-butyl group (a necessary step) will likely be a low-yield process, as it involves separating a minor isomer from a major one. Therefore, the primary criterion for selecting the correct answer must be **chemical feasibility**, not the literal achievement of high yield. The correct option will be the one that is chemically possible, while the others are impossible.\n*   **Identifying Fatal Flaws:** The most efficient method to solve this problem is to eliminate any sequence that contains a chemically impossible or nonsensical step. Common fatal flaws include:\n    *   Attempting a Friedel-Crafts reaction on a strongly deactivated ring or on aniline.\n    *   Attempting a subsequent reaction (like nitration) on a highly unstable intermediate like a diazonium salt.\n    *   An illogical reaction order, such as attempting a reaction on a functional group before it has been created.\n*   **Regioselectivity Control:** The correct pathway must employ a logical sequence of reactions to control the placement of substituents. This often involves modifying a functional group to change its directing effect (e.g., reducing a nitro group to an amine, which is then protonated in acid to become a *meta*-director).\n\n**3. Systematic Evaluation of the Reaction Pathways**\n\nWe will evaluate the four distinct chemical pathways presented across the candidate answers, regardless of how they were labeled (A, B, C, or D).\n\n*   **Pathway involving Friedel-Crafts on Aniline:**\n    *   *Sequence:* i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → ii) Fe/HCl → iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃...\n    *   *Analysis:* This pathway correctly forms aniline in the first two steps. However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n    *   *Fatal Flaw:* This reaction is impossible. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   *Conclusion:* This pathway is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Pathway involving Nitration of a Diazonium Salt:**\n    *   *Sequence:* ...v) NaNO₂/HCl → vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄...\n    *   *Analysis:* This pathway correctly forms a diazonium salt in step (v) and then attempts to nitrate it.\n    *   *Fatal Flaw:* Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis). They are not suitable substrates for further electrophilic substitution and would decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n    *   *Conclusion:* This pathway is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Pathway with Illogical Reaction Order:**\n    *   *Sequence:* ...iv) NaNO₂/HCl → ...viii) Fe/HCl...\n    *   *Analysis:* This pathway attempts a diazotization reaction (which requires a primary amine) before the amine-forming reduction step.\n    *   *Fatal Flaw:* A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that has not yet been formed.\n    *   *Conclusion:* This pathway is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **The Only Chemically Plausible Pathway:**\n    *   *Sequence:* **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → iii) Fe/HCl → iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → v) NaNO₂/HCl → vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → vii) NaOH/EtBr**\n    *   *Analysis:*\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-isomers. The synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho*-isomer**. This step is chemically possible but low-yield.\n        3.  **Step iii:** Reduction of the nitro group yields **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), a *meta*-director. This, along with the *ortho, para*-directing tert-butyl group, directs the incoming nitro group to position 3. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final ethoxy ether product. (Valid)\n    *   *Conclusion:* This is the only sequence where every step is a valid chemical transformation that leads to the target molecule.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBy the process of elimination, three of the four possible synthetic routes contain fatal chemical flaws and are impossible. Only one sequence of reactions is chemically plausible. Although this plausible route has a low-yield step that contradicts the prompt's \"high-yield\" constraint, it is unequivocally the correct answer because all other options are chemically nonsensical. The most consistent labeling in the provided answers assigns this correct sequence to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo decide the final answer, a rigorous step-by-step analysis of each option is necessary, focusing on established principles of organic synthesis.\n\n### **Analysis of the Goal**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents adjacent to one another (a 1,2,3- or vicinal-substitution pattern). This arrangement, especially involving the very bulky tert-butyl group, presents significant synthetic challenges.\n\n### **Careful Points for Evaluation**\n\n1.  **Chemical Feasibility:** The most critical test is whether each step in a sequence is a known, valid chemical reaction. A single impossible step invalidates the entire sequence. Common fatal flaws to look for include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Reactions on Deactivated Rings:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation fails on rings that are strongly deactivated (e.g., by a -NO₂ group) or on anilines (where the Lewis acid catalyst complexes with the basic amino group).\n    *   **Reactions on Unstable Intermediates:** Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt is not a viable reaction.\n    *   **Illogical Reaction Order:** Attempting a reaction on a functional group before it has been created (e.g., performing a diazotization before the amine has been formed).\n\n2.  **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky. It sterically hinders reactions at the adjacent *ortho* positions. Any standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will overwhelmingly favor substitution at the distant *para* position.\n\n3.  **The \"High-Yield\" Constraint:** This constraint is in direct conflict with the steric reality of the target molecule. Any pathway that requires separating a minor *ortho*-substituted isomer from a major *para*-substituted isomer cannot be considered high-yield. In a multiple-choice question, this means we must prioritize chemical possibility over the yield constraint if all other options are impossible.\n\n### **Systematic Evaluation of the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on the principles above.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option A is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable intermediate. Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis) and would decompose under the harsh conditions of nitration.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ... iv) NaNO₂/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   This sequence is written in an illogical order.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** It attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv), which requires a primary aromatic amine. However, the amine is not formed until much later in the sequence (step viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   By elimination, this is the only potentially correct answer. Let's trace the pathway to confirm its validity:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho* isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid, though likely not high-yield due to sterics).\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final ethoxy ether product. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The core synthesis (steps i-vii) is chemically sound and leads to the correct product. The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the correct synthesis that has already been completed.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy systematically analyzing each option, we find that Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option B is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of at least one step, Option B is the only viable choice. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route must be chosen over impossible ones.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a clear consensus on the chemical principles required to solve this problem, even though the lettering of the options is inconsistent across the examples. The correct approach involves identifying chemically impossible pathways to isolate the only feasible, albeit imperfect, option.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis based on the unanimous logic of the candidate answers:\n\n### **Careful Points of Analysis**\n\n1.  **Target Molecule Structure and Steric Hindrance:** The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. It features three adjacent (vicinal) substituents. The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky, which creates significant steric hindrance. This makes any direct substitution at the adjacent *ortho* positions (positions 1 and 3 relative to the tert-butyl group) a difficult and low-yield process.\n\n2.  **The \"High-Yield\" Constraint:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This is a critical but potentially misleading constraint. Any pathway that relies on the nitration of tert-butylbenzene must proceed with the minor *ortho*-isomer, as the *para*-isomer is the major product. This step inherently violates the \"high-yield\" condition. However, the primary criterion for selecting the correct answer is **chemical feasibility**. A chemically possible but inefficient route must be chosen over routes that are chemically impossible.\n\n3.  **Elimination via Fatal Flaws:** The most effective strategy, employed by all candidate answers, is to identify and eliminate sequences containing chemically impossible steps. The common fatal flaws are:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts on Aniline:** Attempting a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Reactions on Unstable Intermediates:** Attempting to perform further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt is not a viable reaction.\n    *   **Illogical Reaction Order:** Attempting a reaction on a functional group before it has been created (e.g., performing a diazotization before the corresponding amine has been formed).\n\n### **Evaluation of the Options**\n\nLet's apply this logic to the specific options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence forms aniline in steps (i) and (ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation in step (iii).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This is the classic \"Friedel-Crafts on aniline\" error. The reaction is impossible.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v) and then attempts to nitrate it in step (vi).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are highly unstable and would decompose under the harsh conditions of nitration.

    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions, a systematic analysis of each option is required, focusing on chemical feasibility, regioselectivity, and potential fatal flaws in the proposed synthetic routes.\n\n### **Careful Points for Analysis**\n\n1.  **Target Molecule Structure:** The goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring. The relative positions are critical: the ethoxy and nitro groups are both *ortho* to the bulky tert-butyl group.\n\n2.  **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl (-tBu) group is exceptionally large. This creates significant steric hindrance, which makes chemical reactions at the adjacent *ortho* positions very difficult. Any standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (like nitration) on tert-butylbenzene will overwhelmingly favor substitution at the distant *para* position.\n\n3.  **The \"High-Yield\" Contradiction:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This is in direct conflict with the steric reality of forming the target molecule. Any pathway that relies on separating the minor *ortho*-substituted product from the major *para*-substituted product cannot be considered high-yield. Therefore, the primary goal must be to find a sequence that is **chemically possible**, as other options may be chemically impossible. An impossible reaction sequence can never be the correct answer.\n\n4.  **Elimination of Impossible Reactions:** The most effective strategy is to identify and eliminate any sequences that contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Common fatal flaws include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Reactions on Anilines:** The Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation or acylation.\n    *   **Reactions on Unstable Intermediates:** Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt is not a viable reaction.\n    *   **Illogical Reaction Order:** Attempting a reaction on a functional group before it has been created (e.g., performing a diazotization before the corresponding amine has been formed).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **Option A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is in an illogical order. It attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv), which requires a primary aromatic amine. However, the amine-forming step (Fe/HCl) does not occur until much later in the sequence (step viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts to perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction does not work because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt that was formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. They would decompose under the harsh reaction conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. By elimination, it must be the correct choice. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-isomers. The synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho*-isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), a *meta*-director. The -tBu group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The core synthesis (steps i-vii) is chemically sound and is the only one that leads to the named product.

Deconstruction of the Goal**\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Constraint:** The synthesis should be \"high-yield\".\n*   **Task:** Evaluate the four provided reaction sequences and select the only one that is chemically viable.\n\n### **2. Careful Points for Analysis**\n\n1.  **Target Molecule Structure:** The product is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) benzene ring. The substituents are a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu), an ethoxy group (-OEt), and a nitro group (-NO₂). The adjacent placement of these groups, especially the bulky -tBu group, presents a significant synthetic challenge.\n2.  **The \"High-Yield\" Constraint:** The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but its large size sterically hinders substitution at the adjacent *ortho* positions. Therefore, any standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will overwhelmingly favor the *para* product. A pathway that relies on separating the minor *ortho* isomer cannot be considered high-yield. This creates a conflict between achieving the correct structure and achieving a high yield, meaning we must prioritize chemical possibility over efficiency.\n3.  **Identification of Fatal Flaws:** The most effective method to solve this problem is to identify chemically impossible or nonsensical steps in the proposed sequences. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option. Common flaws to look for include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation on a Deactivated Ring or Aniline:** Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on rings that are strongly deactivated (e.g., by a nitro group) or on aniline itself, because the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amino group.\n    *   **Reactions on Unstable Intermediates:** Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt is not a viable reaction.\n    *   **Illogical Reaction Order:** Attempting a reaction on a functional group before it has been created (e.g., performing a diazotization before the corresponding amine has been formed).\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This reaction is not feasible. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n    *   This sequence is written in a confusing and illogical order.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (iv) `NaNO₂/HCl` is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine. However, the amine-forming step (`Fe/HCl`) does not occur until much later at step (viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is chemically impossible due to an illogical reaction order.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable intermediate.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis) and would decompose under the harsh conditions of nitration.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   This is the only remaining option. By elimination, it must be the correct choice. Let's analyze its pathway to confirm:\n        1.  **i) Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **ii) Nitration:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho* isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **iv) Nitration:** In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a valid and regioselective step.\n        5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol. (Valid)\n        7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether product. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy elimination, Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step (ii), Option A is the only viable choice. In a multiple-choice format, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route must be selected over impossible ones.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo decide the final answer, a systematic analysis of each proposed reaction sequence is necessary. The evaluation must focus on chemical feasibility, regioselectivity (the directing effects of substituents), and steric hindrance.\n\n### **Careful Points for Analysis**\n\n1.  **Target Molecule Structure:** The goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.

Option C is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step, Option C is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices and must be the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Goal and Target Molecule\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n*   **Structural Analysis:** The target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director. Its most important characteristic is its large size, which creates significant steric hindrance.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Primary Synthetic Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. Introducing a group *ortho* to the very bulky tert-butyl group via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution is difficult and typically a low-yield process. This immediately brings the \"high-yield\" constraint into question, suggesting it might be a distractor or that we must choose the *most* plausible route, not necessarily a perfect one.\n\n### 2. Systematically Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nThe most effective strategy is to identify any chemically impossible or nonsensical steps in each sequence. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Analyze Option B.**\n    *   The sequence is `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This option is nonsensically written with duplicate step numbers. More importantly, step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). The substrate at this point in the synthesis is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, not an amine. Therefore, this step is impossible.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Analyze Option C.**\n    *   The sequence is `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction is impossible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Analyze Option D.**\n    *   The sequence is `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt, which was formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis), not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. They would decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Analyze Option A.**\n    *   By elimination, this is the only remaining possibility. We must verify its chemical logic.\n    *   The sequence is `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho* isomer**. This step is chemically possible but contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition.\n    3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (This is a valid and regioselective step).\n    5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`. (Valid)\n    6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nBy the process of elimination, Options B, C, and D are fundamentally flawed because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical reaction steps. Option A is the only sequence that is chemically plausible from start to finish and leads to the correctly named target molecule. Although the synthesis described in Option A is not truly \"high-yield\" because it relies on the separation of a minor isomer in an early step, it is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices.

Deconstruct the Question and Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n*   **Structural Analysis:** The target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring:\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director. Its large size creates significant steric hindrance.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n\n### **2. Identify Key Synthetic Challenges and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Steric Hindrance.** The primary challenge is the bulky tert-butyl group. Placing substituents at positions 1 and 3 (both *ortho* to the -tBu group) via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is difficult. Any direct EAS on tert-butylbenzene will heavily favor substitution at the *para* position.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"High-Yield\" Constraint.** This constraint is in direct conflict with the steric reality of forming the target molecule. Any pathway that relies on separating a minor *ortho*-substituted isomer from a major *para*-substituted isomer cannot be considered high-yield. However, in a multiple-choice question, the most critical task is to find a *chemically possible* route, as other options may be chemically impossible.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Identifying Fatal Flaws.** The most efficient way to solve this problem is to eliminate any sequence that contains a chemically impossible or nonsensical step. Common fatal flaws include:\n    *   Attempting a Friedel-Crafts reaction on a strongly deactivated ring or on aniline.\n    *   Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt.\n    *   Following an illogical reaction order (e.g., performing a reaction on a functional group before it has been created).\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each option as written in the prompt for chemical feasibility.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence correctly forms aniline in steps (i) and (ii). However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v) and then attempts to nitrate it in step (vi).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis). They are not suitable substrates for a subsequent nitration reaction and would decompose under the harsh conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence is written in a confusing and illogical order. It attempts a diazotization reaction (`iv) NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** The amine-forming step (`viii) Fe/HCl`) does not occur until much later. A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present in the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor ortho isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The core synthesis (steps i-vii) is chemically sound and is the only one that leads to the named product.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy the process of elimination, Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option B is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step, Option B is the only viable choice. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route must be selected over routes that are chemically impossible.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Goal\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Constraint:** The synthesis should be \"high-yield\".\n\n### 2. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Steric Hindrance.** The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky. This creates significant steric hindrance, making it very difficult to introduce new substituents at the adjacent *ortho* positions (in this case, positions 1 and 3 relative to the tert-butyl group).\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"High-Yield\" Constraint.** Standard electrophilic aromatic substitution on tert-butylbenzene heavily favors substitution at the distant *para* position to avoid steric clash. Any pathway that requires substitution *ortho* to the tert-butyl group will likely be a low-yield process. In a multiple-choice question, chemical possibility must take precedence over the yield claim if other options are impossible.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\nThe most effective method is to identify any chemically impossible or nonsensical steps in each sequence. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is nonsensically written with typos and duplicate step numbers. It attempts a diazotization reaction (`iv) NaNO2/HCl`) before the necessary amine has been formed (`viii) Fe/HCl`). This is chemically illogical.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction is impossible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (formed in step v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. They would decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the only sequence that does not contain a fatal chemical flaw. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor ortho isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv (Careful Point 3: Regioselectivity):** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a valid and regioselective step.\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBy elimination, Options A, B, and C are definitively incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical reaction steps. Option D is the only sequence that is chemically plausible and leads to the correctly named target molecule. Although the synthesis is not truly \"high-yield\" because it relies on the separation of a minor isomer in an early step, it is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices. In the context of a multiple-choice question, the only possible route must be selected over the impossible ones.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a rigorous, step-by-step analysis of each option is required. The most effective method is to identify chemically impossible steps to eliminate incorrect options.\n\n### **Careful Points of Analysis**\n\n1.  **Target Molecule Structure:** The product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) benzene ring. The substituents are a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu), an ethoxy group (-OEt), and a nitro group (-NO₂). The adjacent placement of these groups, especially the bulky -tBu group, presents a significant synthetic challenge.\n\n2.  **The \"High-Yield\" Constraint:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but its large size sterically hinders substitution at the adjacent *ortho* positions. Therefore, any standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will overwhelmingly favor the *para* product. A pathway that relies on separating the minor *ortho* isomer cannot be considered high-yield. However, in a multiple-choice question, a chemically *possible* route must be chosen over chemically *impossible* routes, even if it has low-yield steps.\n\n3.  **Identification of Fatal Flaws:** The most effective way to solve this problem is to identify sequences that contain chemically impossible steps. Common flaws to look for include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts reactions on anilines:** The Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation or acylation.\n    *   **Reactions on unstable intermediates:** Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt is not a viable reaction.\n    *   **Illogical reaction order:** Attempting a reaction (e.g., diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl) before the necessary functional group (a primary amine) has been formed.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **Option A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This reaction is not feasible. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is written in a confusing and illogical order. Step (iv) calls for diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine. However, at this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed. A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v) and then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable intermediate in step (vi). Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis) and would decompose under the harsh conditions of nitration.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   This is the only remaining option. By elimination, it must be the correct choice. Let's verify its chemical plausibility:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a valid, regioselective step.\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final ethoxy ether product.

Deconstruct the Goal**\nThe objective is to identify the single correct sequence of reactions from the provided options that results in the **high-yield** synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, starting from benzene.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Steric Hindrance.** The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky.

Systematic Evaluation of Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nThe most effective method is to eliminate any sequence that contains a chemically impossible or nonsensical step.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence is written with duplicate step numbers and is in an illogical order.

Detailed Analysis of the Plausible Option**\n\nBy elimination, Option B is the only remaining choice. We must verify its chemical logic.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    This sequence is the only one without a fatal chemical flaw. Let's trace the pathway:\n    1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene.

The most effective strategy is to first eliminate any options that contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. The single remaining option must be the correct one, even if it has practical limitations.\n\n### Careful Points of Analysis\n\n1.  **Fatal Flaws**: The quickest way to solve this problem is to identify fatal flaws in the reaction sequences. Common flaws to look for include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Reactions on Deactivated Rings/Anilines**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene) and on anilines, as the Lewis acid catalyst complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Reactions on Unstable Intermediates**: Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt is not a viable reaction. Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions.\n    *   **Illogical Reaction Order**: Attempting a reaction on a functional group before it has been created (e.g., performing a diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl before the corresponding amine has been formed via reduction).\n\n2.  **The \"High-Yield\" Conflict**: The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. However, the target molecule has a substituent *ortho* to a very bulky tert-butyl group. Any standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will overwhelmingly favor the *para* product to minimize steric hindrance. This means any pathway relying on the separation of the minor *ortho* isomer cannot be truly high-yield. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically *possible* (even if inefficient) route must be chosen over chemically *impossible* routes.\n\n3.  **Regiochemistry and Directing Effects**: The order of reactions is critical. The directing effects of substituents (ortho, para vs. meta) must be correctly utilized to place the groups in the required 1,2,3-pattern. A key step often involves modifying a functional group (e.g., -NO₂ to -NH₂) to change its directing effect for the next step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation of Options\n\nBased on the options provided in the prompt, we can analyze each one for chemical feasibility.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.

Any pathway that requires substitution *ortho* to the tert-butyl group will likely be a low-yield process. This creates a conflict with the \"high-yield\" requirement in the question. The correct answer must be chemically possible above all else.\n\n### **Systematic Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nWe will analyze each option for chemical feasibility. A single fatal flaw invalidates the entire sequence.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt in step (vi). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis), not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. They would decompose under these harsh conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction is impossible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is written in an illogical order. It attempts a diazotization reaction (`iv) NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine. However, the amine is not formed until much later in the sequence (`viii) Fe/HCl`). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not yet exist.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the only sequence without a fatal flaw. Let's trace the core pathway:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor ortho isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv (Careful Point 3: Regioselectivity):** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is a valid and regioselective step.\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The core sequence (i-vii) is chemically sound and is the only one that leads to the named product. The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the correct synthesis that has already been completed.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy elimination, Options A, B, and C are definitively incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option D is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible series of transformations that successfully produces the target molecule. Although the synthesis is not truly \"high-yield\" due to the poor regioselectivity in step (ii), it is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices. In such a scenario, the chemically possible route must be chosen over the impossible ones.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate responses and a rigorous evaluation of the chemical principles involved.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Goal and Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n*   **Structural Analysis:** The target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy) at C1:** A strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl) at C2:** A weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Its most critical feature is its large size, which creates significant steric hindrance at the adjacent positions (C1 and C3).\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro) at C3:** A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n### **2. Identify the Core Synthetic Challenges and Strategy**\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The primary challenge is installing substituents at positions 1 and 3, which are both *ortho* to the extremely bulky tert-butyl group. A standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) on tert-butylbenzene, such as nitration, will overwhelmingly favor substitution at the *para* position to minimize steric clash.\n*   **The \"High-Yield\" Paradox:** The steric hindrance problem directly conflicts with the \"high-yield\" constraint. This suggests that the question may be flawed, and the primary task is to find the *only chemically possible* route, even if one step is inefficient.\n*   **Strategy:** The most effective way to solve this problem is to use a process of elimination. We will examine each proposed sequence for fatal chemical flaws, such as impossible reactions or an illogical order of steps. A single such flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n### **3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nWe will analyze each option as written in the question prompt.\n\n*   **Option A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is chemically nonsensical. After the initial t-butylation (i) and nitration (ii), it attempts a sulfonation (iii). The correct path would require reduction of the nitro group. Furthermore, it attempts a diazotization (iv) before the required amine is formed (viii). The order is illogical.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It correctly forms aniline in steps (i) and (ii), but then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is impossible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, strongly deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence has multiple flaws. It starts with sulfonation (ii) instead of the necessary nitration. More critically, it attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt in step (vi). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions; they are not suitable substrates for nitration and would decompose.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** By elimination, this is the only potentially correct sequence. Let's trace the core synthesis (steps i-vii):\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-isomers. To proceed, the minor **ortho-isomer** must be isolated. This step is chemically possible but is not high-yield.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine using Fe/HCl, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an *o,p*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using NaNO₂/HCl. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed with heat in aqueous acid to form a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (NaOH) and ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The sequence of reactions is chemically sound and is the only one that leads to the target molecule.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option C is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step (ii), Option C is the only viable choice. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route must be chosen over impossible ones.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky. This creates significant steric hindrance, making it very difficult to introduce new substituents at the adjacent *ortho* positions (positions 1 and 3 relative to the tert-butyl group).\n2.  **The \"High-Yield\" Constraint:** Standard electrophilic aromatic substitution on tert-butylbenzene heavily favors substitution at the distant *para* position to avoid steric clash. Any pathway that requires substitution *ortho* to the tert-butyl group will likely be a low-yield process. This creates a potential conflict with the \"high-yield\" requirement in the question. The correct answer must be chemically possible above all else.\n3.  **Regioselectivity:** The order of introducing the three different functional groups is critical to ensure they end up in the correct 1,2,3-pattern. The directing effects of the substituents must be carefully managed at each step.\n\n### **Step 2: Systematic Elimination of Chemically Impossible Options**\n\nThe most effective strategy is to identify and eliminate any proposed sequences that contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence correctly forms aniline in steps (i) and (ii). However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v) and then attempts to nitrate it in step (vi).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis). They are not suitable substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration and would decompose under the harsh reaction conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** At this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed. A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n### **Step 3: Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Viable Option**\n\nBy elimination, Option B is the only remaining possibility. We must verify its chemical logic.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho* isomer**. This step is chemically possible but contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition.\n    3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (This is a valid and regioselective step).\n    5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO₂/HCl`. (Valid)\n    6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are definitively incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical reaction steps. Option B is the only sequence that is chemically plausible from start to finish and leads to the correctly named target molecule. Although the synthesis described in Option B is not truly \"high-yield\" because it relies on the separation of a minor isomer in an early step, it is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices. In a multiple-choice question, the chemically possible route must be selected over the impossible ones.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Goal**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n*   **Task:** Evaluate the four provided reaction sequences (A, B, C, D) and select the only one that is chemically plausible.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges**\n\nThe target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring. This presents several challenges:\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl group (-tBu) is exceptionally bulky. This makes any reaction at the adjacent (*ortho*) positions (C1 and C3 relative to the t-Bu group) sterically hindered and therefore difficult.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** The order of reactions is critical to ensure the substituents are placed in the correct 1,2,3-pattern. The directing effects of the groups must be carefully managed.\n*   **The \"High-Yield\" Conflict:** A standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene, such as nitration, will overwhelmingly favor substitution at the distant *para* position to avoid steric clash. Any pathway that relies on separating the minor *ortho*-substituted isomer cannot be considered high-yield. This is a critical point: in a multiple-choice question, a sequence that is chemically *possible* but inefficient must be chosen over sequences that are chemically *impossible*.\n\n### **3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nThe most effective method is to eliminate any sequence that contains a chemically impossible or nonsensical step.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This reaction is not feasible. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a positively charged, strongly deactivated ring that prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable intermediate.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis) and would decompose under the harsh conditions of nitration. They are not suitable substrates for further electrophilic substitution.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence is written with confusing numbering. It attempts a diazotization reaction (`iv) NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** At this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed. The reaction is attempted on the wrong functional group in an illogical order.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** By elimination, this is the only potentially correct answer. Let's trace the pathway to confirm its validity.\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho* isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** Reduction of the nitro group yields **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **Step v:** Diazotization of the amino group forms a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The core synthesis (i-vii) is chemically sound and is the only one that leads to the named product. The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the correct synthesis.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy systematically eliminating the impossible options (A, B, and C), Option D remains as the only chemically viable pathway. The conflict with the \"high-yield\" condition is a common feature in such questions, designed to test the ability to prioritize chemical possibility over stated yield when all other options are fundamentally flawed.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo decide the final answer, a systematic analysis of the chemical problem is required, synthesizing the reasoning presented in the candidate answers and focusing on the most critical aspects of the synthesis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Goal and Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n\nThe target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO₂). The primary challenge is installing these groups in the correct 1,2,3-pattern, especially given the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group.\n\n**2. Careful Points to Consider**\n\nBased on a consensus analysis of the provided answers, the following points are critical:\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky. This property is the most significant factor in the synthesis, as it sterically hinders reactions at the adjacent *ortho* positions. Any direct electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will overwhelmingly favor substitution at the distant *para* position.\n*   **The \"High-Yield\" Contradiction:** The question's requirement for a \"high-yield\" synthesis is in direct conflict with the chemical reality of the target molecule. Any pathway that requires substitution *ortho* to the tert-butyl group (a necessary step) will likely be a low-yield process, as it involves separating a minor isomer from a major one. Therefore, the primary criterion for selecting the correct answer must be **chemical feasibility**, not the literal achievement of high yield. The correct option will be the one that is chemically possible, while the others are impossible.\n*   **Identifying Fatal Flaws:** The most efficient method to solve this problem is to eliminate any sequence that contains a chemically impossible or nonsensical step. Common fatal flaws include:\n    *   Attempting a Friedel-Crafts reaction on a strongly deactivated ring or on aniline.\n    *   Attempting a subsequent reaction (like nitration) on a highly unstable intermediate like a diazonium salt.\n    *   An illogical reaction order, such as attempting a reaction on a functional group before it has been created.\n*   **Regioselectivity Control:** The correct pathway must employ a logical sequence of reactions to control the placement of substituents. This often involves modifying a functional group to change its directing effect (e.g., reducing a nitro group to an amine, which is then protonated in acid to become a *meta*-director).\n\n**3. Systematic Evaluation of the Reaction Pathways**\n\nWe will evaluate the four distinct chemical pathways presented across the candidate answers, regardless of how they were labeled (A, B, C, or D).\n\n*   **Pathway involving Friedel-Crafts on Aniline:**\n    *   *Sequence:* i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → ii) Fe/HCl → iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃...\n    *   *Analysis:* This pathway correctly forms aniline in the first two steps. However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n    *   *Fatal Flaw:* This reaction is impossible. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   *Conclusion:* This pathway is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Pathway involving Nitration of a Diazonium Salt:**\n    *   *Sequence:* ...v) NaNO₂/HCl → vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄...\n    *   *Analysis:* This pathway correctly forms a diazonium salt in step (v) and then attempts to nitrate it.\n    *   *Fatal Flaw:* Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis). They are not suitable substrates for further electrophilic substitution and would decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n    *   *Conclusion:* This pathway is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Pathway with Illogical Reaction Order:**\n    *   *Sequence:* ...iv) NaNO₂/HCl → ...viii) Fe/HCl...\n    *   *Analysis:* This pathway attempts a diazotization reaction (which requires a primary amine) before the amine-forming reduction step.\n    *   *Fatal Flaw:* A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that has not yet been formed.\n    *   *Conclusion:* This pathway is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **The Only Chemically Plausible Pathway:**\n    *   *Sequence:* **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → iii) Fe/HCl → iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → v) NaNO₂/HCl → vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → vii) NaOH/EtBr**\n    *   *Analysis:*\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-isomers. The synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho*-isomer**. This step is chemically possible but low-yield.\n        3.  **Step iii:** Reduction of the nitro group yields **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), a *meta*-director. This, along with the *ortho, para*-directing tert-butyl group, directs the incoming nitro group to position 3. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final ethoxy ether product. (Valid)\n    *   *Conclusion:* This is the only sequence where every step is a valid chemical transformation that leads to the target molecule.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBy the process of elimination, three of the four possible synthetic routes contain fatal chemical flaws and are impossible. Only one sequence of reactions is chemically plausible. Although this plausible route has a low-yield step that contradicts the prompt's \"high-yield\" constraint, it is unequivocally the correct answer because all other options are chemically nonsensical. The most consistent labeling in the provided answers assigns this correct sequence to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo decide the final answer, a rigorous step-by-step analysis of each option is necessary, focusing on established principles of organic synthesis.\n\n### **Analysis of the Goal**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents adjacent to one another (a 1,2,3- or vicinal-substitution pattern). This arrangement, especially involving the very bulky tert-butyl group, presents significant synthetic challenges.\n\n### **Careful Points for Evaluation**\n\n1.  **Chemical Feasibility:** The most critical test is whether each step in a sequence is a known, valid chemical reaction. A single impossible step invalidates the entire sequence. Common fatal flaws to look for include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Reactions on Deactivated Rings:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation fails on rings that are strongly deactivated (e.g., by a -NO₂ group) or on anilines (where the Lewis acid catalyst complexes with the basic amino group).\n    *   **Reactions on Unstable Intermediates:** Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt is not a viable reaction.\n    *   **Illogical Reaction Order:** Attempting a reaction on a functional group before it has been created (e.g., performing a diazotization before the amine has been formed).\n\n2.  **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky. It sterically hinders reactions at the adjacent *ortho* positions. Any standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will overwhelmingly favor substitution at the distant *para* position.\n\n3.  **The \"High-Yield\" Constraint:** This constraint is in direct conflict with the steric reality of the target molecule. Any pathway that requires separating a minor *ortho*-substituted isomer from a major *para*-substituted isomer cannot be considered high-yield. In a multiple-choice question, this means we must prioritize chemical possibility over the yield constraint if all other options are impossible.\n\n### **Systematic Evaluation of the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on the principles above.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option A is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable intermediate. Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis) and would decompose under the harsh conditions of nitration.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ... iv) NaNO₂/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   This sequence is written in an illogical order.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** It attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv), which requires a primary aromatic amine. However, the amine is not formed until much later in the sequence (step viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   By elimination, this is the only potentially correct answer. Let's trace the pathway to confirm its validity:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho* isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid, though likely not high-yield due to sterics).\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final ethoxy ether product. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The core synthesis (steps i-vii) is chemically sound and leads to the correct product. The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the correct synthesis that has already been completed.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy systematically analyzing each option, we find that Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option B is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of at least one step, Option B is the only viable choice. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route must be chosen over impossible ones.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a clear consensus on the chemical principles required to solve this problem, even though the lettering of the options is inconsistent across the examples. The correct approach involves identifying chemically impossible pathways to isolate the only feasible, albeit imperfect, option.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis based on the unanimous logic of the candidate answers:\n\n### **Careful Points of Analysis**\n\n1.  **Target Molecule Structure and Steric Hindrance:** The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. It features three adjacent (vicinal) substituents. The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky, which creates significant steric hindrance. This makes any direct substitution at the adjacent *ortho* positions (positions 1 and 3 relative to the tert-butyl group) a difficult and low-yield process.\n\n2.  **The \"High-Yield\" Constraint:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This is a critical but potentially misleading constraint. Any pathway that relies on the nitration of tert-butylbenzene must proceed with the minor *ortho*-isomer, as the *para*-isomer is the major product. This step inherently violates the \"high-yield\" condition. However, the primary criterion for selecting the correct answer is **chemical feasibility**. A chemically possible but inefficient route must be chosen over routes that are chemically impossible.\n\n3.  **Elimination via Fatal Flaws:** The most effective strategy, employed by all candidate answers, is to identify and eliminate sequences containing chemically impossible steps. The common fatal flaws are:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts on Aniline:** Attempting a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Reactions on Unstable Intermediates:** Attempting to perform further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt is not a viable reaction.\n    *   **Illogical Reaction Order:** Attempting a reaction on a functional group before it has been created (e.g., performing a diazotization before the corresponding amine has been formed).\n\n### **Evaluation of the Options**\n\nLet's apply this logic to the specific options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence forms aniline in steps (i) and (ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation in step (iii).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This is the classic \"Friedel-Crafts on aniline\" error. The reaction is impossible.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v) and then attempts to nitrate it in step (vi).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are highly unstable and would decompose under the harsh conditions of nitration. This reaction is impossible.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; ... iv) NaNO₂/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence is written in an illogical order. It attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv) which requires a primary amine. However, the amine-forming step (reduction with Fe/HCl) does not occur until step (viii).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the only remaining option. By elimination, it must be the correct pathway.\n        1.  **i) Alkylation:** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **ii) Nitration:** tert-butylbenzene → *ortho*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (minor product). (Valid, but not high-yield)\n        3.  **iii) Reduction:** → **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **iv) Nitration:** → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **v) Diazotization:** → Diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and is the only one that leads to the target molecule. The superfluous steps at the end (viii, ix) do not invalidate the correct synthesis that has already been completed in steps i-vii.\n\nBased on the unanimous logic of the candidate answers, which involves eliminating the three chemically impossible options, the only viable sequence is the one described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
