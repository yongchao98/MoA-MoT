Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. In the context of a particle detector, \"observing\" a decay means the particle leaves a track of a certain length before it decays. This track length must be greater than the detector's resolution. Therefore, we need to find the resolution distance, `d`, such that the probability of the particle traveling a distance greater than `d` is at least 30%.\n\n### 2. Key Physics Principles\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle is moving at a high energy (27 GeV) compared to its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must use the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) to account for time dilation.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of particles is a random process that follows an exponential law. The fraction of particles that travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by $P(x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy ($m_0c^2$).\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$) in the lab frame**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), the speed of light (c), and the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$). A precise formula is:\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $\\gamma \\approx 7.918$\n\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (7.854)$\n$\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the required resolution (d)**\nWe need to find the resolution `d` such that at least 30% of particles travel a distance greater than `d`. This gives us the condition:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed,\" which in this context means the largest (coarsest) resolution that still satisfies the condition. We solve for the boundary case:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m})$\n$d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 4: Compare with options and reconcile**\nOur calculated value is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The closest option is C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nThe discrepancy is common in such problems. It often arises because a round percentage like \"30%\" is an approximation for a simpler fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended fraction was $1/3$ (which is approximately 33.3%).\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n$-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n$d = \\lambda \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986$\n$d \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result, $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an almost perfect match for option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The minor difference (<0.5%) is negligible and likely due to the rounding of the initial values in the problem statement.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculation, especially under the highly plausible assumption that \"at least 30%\" was intended to be \"at least 1/3\", points directly to option C. All other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Principles\nThe problem involves a high-energy particle, which means we must use the principles of special relativity.\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The particle's total energy ($E$) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$), so it is highly relativistic.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor quantifies the relativistic effects and is calculated as the ratio of total energy to rest mass energy: $\\gamma = E / (m_0c^2)$.\n*   **Time Dilation:** In the laboratory's frame of reference (the Bubble Chamber), the particle's average lifetime ($\\tau$) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by a factor of $\\gamma$. So, $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It is calculated as $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity. For a highly relativistic particle, $v$ is very close to the speed of light, $c$. A more precise formula is $\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n*   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track length must be greater than the detector's resolution, $d$. The problem requires that at least 30% of the decays are observed, which translates to the condition: $P(d) = e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**\nGiven:\n*   Total energy $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest mass energy $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**\nGiven:\n*   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nUsing the formula $\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$:\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times 7.854$\n$\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the required resolution ($d$)**\nThe condition is that the probability of traveling a distance greater than the resolution $d$ must be at least 30%:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the maximum allowed resolution (which corresponds to the minimum requirement), we solve for the boundary case:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m})$\n$d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis means the resolution must be less than or equal to $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### 3. Compare with Options and Final Decision\n\nThe calculated maximum allowed resolution is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's examine the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n\n*   Option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is less than our calculated threshold of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. A detector with this resolution would observe $e^{-(2.08 \\times 10^{-6}) / (1.885 \\times 10^{-6})} \\approx 33.2\\%$ of decays, which satisfies the \"at least 30%\" condition.\n*   Options C and D are too large (not sensitive enough).\n*   Option A is a much finer resolution than required.\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\". In the context of such problems, this refers to the coarsest (largest value) resolution that meets the criteria. Among the valid options, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is the most plausible answer.\n\nFurthermore, as noted by several candidate answers, it is common for percentages in physics problems to be approximations of simple fractions. If we assume \"at least 30%\" was an approximation for \"at least 1/3\", the calculation becomes:\n$d = \\lambda \\times \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\nThis result matches option B almost perfectly, strengthening the conclusion that it is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the particle decays. In physics problems, \"observing\" a decay means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution ($d_{res}$). The decay process follows an exponential law, so the fraction of particles traveling a distance greater than $d_{res}$ is given by $P(x > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Set up the Equation:** We need to find the resolution $d_{res}$ that satisfies the condition $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$. The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\", which in this context means the largest possible (i.e., coarsest) resolution that still meets the criterion. We solve for the boundary condition: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$.\n\n3.  **Refine the Equation:** It is very common in such problems for a percentage like \"30%\" to be an approximation for a simple fraction, such as $1/3 \\approx 33.3\\%$. Using $1/3$ often leads to a result that perfectly matches one of the options. Let's test this hypothesis by solving $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives $d_{res} = \\lambda \\ln(3)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** To find $d_{res}$, we first need to calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$. This requires a few steps from special relativity:\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = E / (m_0c^2)$.\n    *   Then, use $\\gamma$ to find the mean decay length in the lab frame using the formula $\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations with high precision and compare the final result to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Step 1: Define the given physical constants and values ---\nE = 27.0       # Total energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41      # Rest mass in GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16   # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) ---\n# The Lorentz factor is the ratio of total energy to rest mass energy.\ngamma = E / m0\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in the lab frame ---\n# The formula is lambda = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nmean_decay_length = c * tau0 * np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the required resolution (d_res) ---\n# We need to observe at least 30% of decays.

This makes option B the only physically plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Principles\nThe problem involves a high-energy particle decaying in a detector. To solve it, we need to combine concepts from special relativity and the law of radioactive decay.\n\n*   **Special Relativity**: Since the particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), it is moving at a relativistic speed. This means its lifetime as observed in the laboratory (the bubble chamber) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This effect is called time dilation.\n*   **Time Dilation**: The lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$, is related to the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$, by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$: $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$): $\\gamma = E / (m_0c^2)$.\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: The average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is called the mean decay length. It is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau$). For highly relativistic particles, $v \\approx c$. A more precise formula is $\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law**: The decay process is random. The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n*   **Observation Condition**: To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track must be longer than the detector's resolution, $d$. The problem requires that at least 30% of the decays are observed, which translates to the condition: $P(x > d) \\ge 0.30$.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**\nGiven $E = 27$ GeV and $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**\nGiven $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s and using $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n$\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times 7.854 \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the required resolution ($d$)**\nThe condition is that the fraction of observed decays must be at least 30%:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution\". In this context, this refers to the coarsest (largest) resolution that still satisfies the condition. We therefore solve for the boundary case:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis means the resolution $d$ must be less than or equal to $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### 3. Compare with Options and Final Decision\n\nThe calculated threshold for the resolution is $d \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's examine the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\n*   Options B, C, and D have the wrong order of magnitude.\n*   Option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is the only physically plausible choice. It satisfies the condition, as $2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\nThe slight difference between the calculated threshold ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the provided answer ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is a common feature in such problems and is likely due to the input values being chosen to give a clean answer for a slightly different condition. As many of the candidate answers correctly point out, if the condition were to observe at least 1/3 ($\\approx 33.3\\%$) of the decays, the calculation would be:\n$d = \\lambda \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\nThis result is an almost perfect match for option A.\n\nTherefore, based on a rigorous calculation and analysis of the options, the correct answer is $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics of the Problem\nThe question asks for the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of a highly energetic particle, $X^0$. This involves several key physics principles:\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle is moving at a relativistic speed, so its lifetime as measured in the laboratory (the Bubble Chamber) will be longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime). This is the principle of time dilation.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a certain distance before decaying follows an exponential decay law.\n*   **Detector Resolution:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must leave a track of a certain length before it decays. This track length must be greater than the detector's resolution.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, quantifies the relativistic effects and is the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n*   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$) in the Lab Frame**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It depends on the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), the speed of light ($c$), and the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$). A precise formula is:\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\n*   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of Light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term $\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$:\n$\\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{62.69 - 1} = \\sqrt{61.69} \\approx 7.854$\n\nNow, we can calculate the mean decay length, $\\lambda$:\n$\\lambda \\approx (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times 7.854$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times 7.854 \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution ($d$)**\nThe fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$. For a decay to be observed, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, $d$. The problem requires that this fraction be at least 30% (0.30).\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition. This gives the largest possible resolution value that still satisfies the condition.\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3. Analysis and Comparison with Options\n\nOur calculated value is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Now let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 2.08*1e-1 m\nB) 2.08*1e-3 m\nC) 2.08*1e-9 m\nD) 2.08*1e-6 m\n\nThe calculated value is very close to option D. The small discrepancy is a common feature in such problems and often points to a slight simplification in the problem statement.\n\n**Reconciling the Discrepancy:**\nLet's test the hypothesis, as suggested by several of the candidate answers, that \"30%\" was an approximation for the fraction $1/3$ (which is approximately 33.3%). This is a common practice in physics problems to yield a cleaner answer.\nIf we set the condition to $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$:\n$-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n$d = \\lambda \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is extremely close to the value in option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The remaining difference is less than 0.5% and can be attributed to the rounding of the initial constants ($m_0$ or $\\tau_0$) used to create the problem. This confirms that option D is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. In the context of particle detectors, \"observing\" a decay means that the particle leaves a track of a certain length before it decays. This track length must be greater than the detector's spatial resolution. Therefore, we need to find the resolution, let's call it `d`, such that the probability of the particle traveling a distance `x > d` is at least 30%.\n\n**2. Identify the Physical Principles and Formulas**\n*   **Relativistic Effects**: The particle's energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must use formulas from special relativity.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: This factor quantifies the relativistic effects. It's the ratio of the total energy (E) to the rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: This is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before decaying. It is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) and the Lorentz factor.

This confirms that A is the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the minimum detector resolution required to observe the decay of a relativistic particle. This involves several key concepts:\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle is moving at a high energy (27 GeV) compared to its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so its lifetime as observed in the laboratory (the Bubble Chamber) will be longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of particles is a random process. The probability that a particle travels a certain distance before decaying follows an exponential law.\n*   **Detector Resolution:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must leave a track of a certain minimum length before it decays. This minimum length is the detector's resolution. We need to find the resolution `d` such that at least 30% of the particles travel a distance greater than or equal to `d`.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m₀c²).\n*   E = 27 GeV\n*   m₀c² = 3.41 GeV\n\nγ = E / (m₀c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L) in the Lab Frame**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It can be calculated using the proper lifetime (τ₀), the speed of light (c), and the Lorentz factor (γ). A direct formula is:\nL = c ⋅ τ₀ ⋅ √(γ² - 1)\n\n*   c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s\n*   γ ≈ 7.918\n\nL = (3 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) ⋅ √(7.918² - 1)\nL ≈ (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) ⋅ √(62.69 - 1)\nL ≈ (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) ⋅ 7.854\nL ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution (d)**\nThe fraction of particles that travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by P(x) = e⁻ˣ/ᴸ. We need to observe at least 30% of the decays, so the resolution `d` must satisfy:\nP(d) = e⁻ᵈ/ᴸ ≥ 0.30\n\nTo find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition. It is a common practice in such physics problems for percentages like 30% to be an approximation of a simple fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended fraction was 1/3 (≈ 33.3%), as this is very close to 30% and often yields a cleaner result that matches the options.\n\nSetting the probability to 1/3:\ne⁻ᵈ/ᴸ = 1/3\n\nTo solve for `d`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n-d/L = ln(1/3) = -ln(3)\nd = L ⋅ ln(3)\n\nNow, substitute the calculated value for L:\nd ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) ⋅ (1.0986)\nd ≈ 2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### **3. Conclusion and Comparison with Options**\n\nThe calculated resolution is approximately **2.07 × 10⁻⁶ m**. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n\nThe calculated value of 2.07 × 10⁻⁶ m is an excellent match for option B, 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m. The minor difference (less than 0.5%) is negligible and can be attributed to the precision of the physical constants used in the problem's creation. The other options differ by several orders of magnitude.\n\nTherefore, the most logical and well-supported answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Principles\nThe problem involves a high-energy particle decaying in a detector. This requires applying principles from special relativity and particle physics.\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle's energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. This means its lifetime as observed in the laboratory (the Bubble Chamber) will be significantly longer than its proper lifetime due to **time dilation**.\n*   **Decay Length:** Because of its high speed and dilated lifetime, the particle will travel a certain average distance in the lab before decaying. This is known as the **mean decay length**.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of particles is a random process. The probability that a particle travels a certain distance before decaying follows an **exponential decay law**.\n*   **Detector Resolution:** To \"observe\" a decay, the track left by the particle must be longer than the detector's resolution. The question asks for the minimum resolution needed to see at least 30% of the decays. This means we need to find the distance `d` such that the probability of the particle traveling farther than `d` is at least 30%.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor quantifies the relativistic effects. It's the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n*   $E = 27$ GeV\n*   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$) in the Laboratory Frame**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It can be calculated using the formula:\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime.\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $\\gamma \\approx 7.918$\n\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 7.854 \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution ($d$)**\nThe fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$. We need this fraction to be at least 30% (0.30) for a resolution of $d$.\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution\", which in this context means the largest possible (coarsest) resolution `d` that still satisfies the condition. We solve for the boundary case:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n$-d/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 4: Reconcile with Options and Refine the Condition**\nOur calculated value is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The closest option is $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The discrepancy is about 10%. In physics problems of this type, it is very common for a percentage like \"30%\" to be a rounded approximation of a simpler fraction, such as $1/3$. Let's test this hypothesis.\nIf the condition is to observe at least $1/3$ of the decays:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n$-d/\\lambda = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n$d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis refined calculation gives a result of $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is extremely close to the option $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The negligible difference (<0.5%) can be attributed to the precision of the physical constants used to create the problem.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculation based on the most likely intended condition (observing at least 1/3 of decays) provides a result that matches one of the options almost perfectly.\n\n*   Calculated resolution: $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n*   Option B: $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nThe other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude.

A precise formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c\\tau_0$, where *p* is the momentum and $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime.\n\nFirst, find the momentum term *pc* using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n*   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = 27^2 - 3.41^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719$ GeV²\n*   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\nNow, calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$:\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n*   $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 3: Determine the required resolution (d)**\nThe condition is that the fraction of observed decays must be at least 30%.\n*   $P(x > d) = e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nThis inequality sets an upper limit on the resolution *d*. To find this limit, we solve the boundary case:\n*   $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n*   $-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n*   $d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis means the resolution *d* must be less than or equal to $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### 3.

Understand the Physical Principles\nThe problem involves a high-energy particle decaying in a detector. To solve it, we need to combine concepts from special relativity and the law of radioactive decay.\n\n*   **Special Relativity**: Since the particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), it is moving at a relativistic speed. This means its lifetime as observed in the laboratory (the bubble chamber) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).

It is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau$). For highly relativistic particles, $v \\approx c$. A more precise formula is $\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law**: The decay process is random. The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n*   **Observation Condition**: To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track must be longer than the detector's resolution, $d$.

This involves several key physics principles:\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle is moving at a relativistic speed, so its lifetime as measured in the laboratory (the Bubble Chamber) will be longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime). This is the principle of time dilation.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a certain distance before decaying follows an exponential decay law.\n*   **Detector Resolution:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must leave a track of a certain length before it decays. This track length must be greater than the detector's resolution.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, quantifies the relativistic effects and is the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n*   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$) in the Lab Frame**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It depends on the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), the speed of light ($c$), and the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$). A precise formula is:\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\n*   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of Light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term $\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$:\n$\\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{62.69 - 1} = \\sqrt{61.69} \\approx 7.854$\n\nNow, we can calculate the mean decay length, $\\lambda$:\n$\\lambda \\approx (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times 7.854$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times 7.854 \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution ($d$)**\nThe fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$. For a decay to be observed, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, $d$. The problem requires that this fraction be at least 30% (0.30).\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition. This gives the largest possible resolution value that still satisfies the condition.\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3.

The small discrepancy is a common feature in such problems and often points to a slight simplification in the problem statement.\n\n**Reconciling the Discrepancy:**\nLet's test the hypothesis, as suggested by several of the candidate answers, that \"30%\" was an approximation for the fraction $1/3$ (which is approximately 33.3%). This is a common practice in physics problems to yield a cleaner answer.\nIf we set the condition to $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$:\n$-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n$d = \\lambda \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is extremely close to the value in option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The remaining difference is less than 0.5% and can be attributed to the rounding of the initial constants ($m_0$ or $\\tau_0$) used to create the problem.

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. In the context of particle detectors, \"observing\" a decay means that the particle leaves a track of a certain length before it decays. This track length must be greater than the detector's spatial resolution. Therefore, we need to find the resolution, let's call it `d`, such that the probability of the particle traveling a distance `x > d` is at least 30%.\n\n**2. Identify the Physical Principles and Formulas**\n*   **Relativistic Effects**: The particle's energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic.

Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem involves a high-energy particle, which means we must use the principles of Special Relativity.\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle is moving at a speed close to the speed of light. Its lifetime as observed in the laboratory (the Bubble Chamber) will be longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime). This is known as time dilation.\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** Due to time dilation, the particle will travel, on average, a longer distance in the lab before decaying. This average distance is called the mean decay length.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random, probabilistic process. The fraction of particles that travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law: $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n*   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track must be long enough to be resolved by the detector.

This involves several key concepts:\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle is moving at a high energy (27 GeV) compared to its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so its lifetime as observed in the laboratory (the Bubble Chamber) will be longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of particles is a random process. The probability that a particle travels a certain distance before decaying follows an exponential law.\n*   **Detector Resolution:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must leave a track of a certain minimum length before it decays. This minimum length is the detector's resolution. We need to find the resolution `d` such that at least 30% of the particles travel a distance greater than or equal to `d`.\n\n### **2.

Let's test the hypothesis that the intended fraction was 1/3 (≈ 33.3%), as this is very close to 30% and often yields a cleaner result that matches the options.\n\nSetting the probability to 1/3:\ne⁻ᵈ/ᴸ = 1/3\n\nTo solve for `d`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n-d/L = ln(1/3) = -ln(3)\nd = L ⋅ ln(3)\n\nNow, substitute the calculated value for L:\nd ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) ⋅ (1.0986)\nd ≈ 2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### **3. Conclusion and Comparison with Options**\n\nThe calculated resolution is approximately **2.07 × 10⁻⁶ m**. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n\nThe calculated value of 2.07 × 10⁻⁶ m is an excellent match for option B, 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m. The minor difference (less than 0.5%) is negligible and can be attributed to the precision of the physical constants used in the problem's creation. The other options differ by several orders of magnitude.\n\nTherefore, the most logical and well-supported answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Principles\nThe problem involves a high-energy particle decaying in a detector. This requires applying principles from special relativity and particle physics.\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle's energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. This means its lifetime as observed in the laboratory (the Bubble Chamber) will be significantly longer than its proper lifetime due to **time dilation**.\n*   **Decay Length:** Because of its high speed and dilated lifetime, the particle will travel a certain average distance in the lab before decaying. This is known as the **mean decay length**.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of particles is a random process. The probability that a particle travels a certain distance before decaying follows an **exponential decay law**.\n*   **Detector Resolution:** To \"observe\" a decay, the track left by the particle must be longer than the detector's resolution. The question asks for the minimum resolution needed to see at least 30% of the decays. This means we need to find the distance `d` such that the probability of the particle traveling farther than `d` is at least 30%.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor quantifies the relativistic effects. It's the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n*   $E = 27$ GeV\n*   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$) in the Laboratory Frame**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It can be calculated using the formula:\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime.\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $\\gamma \\approx 7.918$\n\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 7.854 \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution ($d$)**\nThe fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$. We need this fraction to be at least 30% (0.30) for a resolution of $d$.\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution\", which in this context means the largest possible (coarsest) resolution `d` that still satisfies the condition. We solve for the boundary case:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n$-d/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 4: Reconcile with Options and Refine the Condition**\nOur calculated value is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The closest option is $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The discrepancy is about 10%. In physics problems of this type, it is very common for a percentage like \"30%\" to be a rounded approximation of a simpler fraction, such as $1/3$. Let's test this hypothesis.\nIf the condition is to observe at least $1/3$ of the decays:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n$-d/\\lambda = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n$d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis refined calculation gives a result of $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is extremely close to the option $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The negligible difference (<0.5%) can be attributed to the precision of the physical constants used to create the problem.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculation based on the most likely intended condition (observing at least 1/3 of decays) provides a result that matches one of the options almost perfectly.\n\n*   Calculated resolution: $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n*   Option B: $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nThe other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Principles\nThe problem involves a relativistic particle decaying in a detector. To solve it, we need to apply concepts from special relativity and particle decay statistics.\n*   **Relativistic Effects**: The particle is moving at a high energy (27 GeV) compared to its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. This means its observed lifetime in the laboratory frame will be longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation.\n*   **Decay Length**: The distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is called the decay length. We need to calculate the mean (average) decay length.\n*   **Exponential Decay**: The decay of particles is a random process that follows an exponential probability law. The fraction of particles that travel a distance *x* or more before decaying is given by $P(x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length.\n*   **Detector Resolution**: To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track must be longer than the detector's resolution, *d*. The problem requires finding the resolution *d* such that at least 30% of decays are observed, meaning $P(x > d) \\ge 0.30$.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n*   $E = 27$ GeV\n*   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame. A precise formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c\\tau_0$, where *p* is the momentum and $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime.\n\nFirst, find the momentum term *pc* using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n*   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = 27^2 - 3.41^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719$ GeV²\n*   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\nNow, calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$:\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n*   $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 3: Determine the required resolution (d)**\nThe condition is that the fraction of observed decays must be at least 30%.\n*   $P(x > d) = e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nThis inequality sets an upper limit on the resolution *d*. To find this limit, we solve the boundary case:\n*   $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n*   $-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n*   $d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis means the resolution *d* must be less than or equal to $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### 3. Compare with Options and Refine Interpretation\nThe calculated maximum allowed resolution is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's examine the options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\nOnly option A is of the correct order of magnitude and satisfies the condition ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$).\n\nThe discrepancy between our calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the closest option ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is a common feature in physics problems. It often suggests that the given percentage (30%) is an approximation for a simple fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended condition was to observe at least 1/3 of the decays (since $1/3 \\approx 33.3\\%$, which is \"at least 30%\").\n\n*   $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 1/3$\n*   $-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} \\ge \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n*   $d \\le \\lambda \\ln(3)$\n*   $d \\le (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis refined calculation gives a maximum resolution of $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is an excellent match for option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The tiny remaining difference (<0.5%) is negligible and likely due to the rounding of the initial values provided in the problem.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculation, especially when refined with the common assumption that \"30%\" is an approximation for \"1/3\", points directly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
