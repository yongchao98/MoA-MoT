It suggests a disproportionation reaction. A classic example that fits this description is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride.\n    Let's test the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂): `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This reaction produces solid elemental sulfur (`A`).\n    *   It produces hydrochloric acid (`F`), which is a strong acid.\n    *   It produces sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid (`G`).\n    *   This perfectly matches the clue. So, we can hypothesize: **A = S**, **C = SCl₂**, **F = HCl**, **G = H₂SO₃**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    Let's test our hypothesis with this clue.\n    *   `A` is sulfur. The most stable allotrope of sulfur at standard conditions is a solid crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   `C` is sulfur dichloride, **SCl₂**, which is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   The reaction requires a source of chlorine, so gas **B = Cl₂**.\n    *   Now, let's check the stoichiometry: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This balanced equation shows that 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (Cl₂). This is a perfect fit.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 4: `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`**\n    *   We know gas `B` is chlorine, **Cl₂**.\n    *   So, gas `D` reacts with `Cl₂` in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent `H`.\n    *   A very common industrial reaction that fits this is the addition of chlorine to ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   The product, 1,2-dichloroethane (`H`), is a widely used solvent.\n    *   This allows us to identify: **D = C₂H₄** (ethene) and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2: `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`**\n    *   We have identified `C = SCl₂` and `D = C₂H₄`.\n    *   The reaction is: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of **bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide**, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   This product is commonly known as **Mustard Gas**, an infamous chemical warfare agent that is extremely hazardous.\n    *   This confirms our identification: **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E (Mustard Gas)**\n    *   The molecule is `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`. It has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups, with a bent geometry at the sulfur.\n    *   The molecule is flexible due to rotation around the single bonds. We need to find the symmetry of its most stable conformation.\n    *   The molecule is not linear (ruling out D∞h) and does not have high symmetry like a square planar molecule (ruling out D4h).\n    *   For the molecule to have C2v symmetry, it would need to be planar, which would cause high steric strain, making that conformation unstable.\n    *   The most stable conformation of mustard gas possesses a single symmetry element (besides identity): a two-fold axis of rotation (**C₂**) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    *   Since the only symmetry element is a C₂ axis, the molecular symmetry group is **C₂**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe extremely hazardous product E is mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, which has a molecular symmetry group of C₂. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances, particularly the hazardous product E, and then determine its molecular symmetry.\n\nHere is a systematic analysis of the clues:\n\n**1. Analysis of Clue 3: The Hydrolysis Reaction**\n*   **Clue:** `C + H₂O → A (solid) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`\n*   **Reasoning:** This is the most chemically specific clue. A single compound `C` hydrolyzes to regenerate the starting solid `A` and produce two different acids. This suggests a disproportionation reaction. A classic example that fits this description is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride.\n*   **Hypothesis:** Let's test the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂): `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This reaction produces solid elemental sulfur. Let **A = Sulfur (S)**.\n    *   It produces hydrochloric acid (**F = HCl**), which is a strong acid.\n    *   It produces sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (**G = H₂SO₃**), a weak acid.\n    *   This hypothesis perfectly matches the clue. Therefore, we can tentatively identify **C = SCl₂**.\n\n**2. Analysis of Clue 1: The Formation of C**\n*   **Clue:** `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`\n*   **Reasoning:** We test our hypothesis with these identities.\n    *   A = Sulfur. The most stable allotrope of sulfur at standard conditions is a solid crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   C = SCl₂. Sulfur dichloride is a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   B must be the source of chlorine, so **B = Cl₂ (Chlorine gas)**.\n*   **Stoichiometry Check:** Let's write the balanced equation: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This equation shows that 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (Cl₂). This is a perfect and compelling match for the clue.\n\n**3. Analysis of Clue 4: The Formation of H**\n*   **Clue:** `D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Reasoning:** We know B is chlorine (Cl₂). We need a gas `D` that reacts 1:1 with chlorine to form a solvent `H`.\n*   **Hypothesis:** A common industrial reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethene (ethylene).\n    *   `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    *   This reaction fits the 1:1 stoichiometry. The product, 1,2-dichloroethane, is a widely used solvent.\n    *   Therefore, we can identify **D = C₂H₄ (Ethene)** and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**.\n\n**4. Analysis of Clue 2: The Formation of E**\n*   **Clue:** `C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n*   **Reasoning:** We substitute our identified compounds:\n    *   C = SCl₂\n    *   D = C₂H₄\n    *   The reaction is: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n*   **Identification:** This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2CH₂=CH₂ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The product, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, is commonly known as **mustard gas**, a chemical warfare agent that is extremely hazardous. This confirms our identification.\n    *   **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas)**.\n\n**5. Determination of the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n*   **Molecule:** E is mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent due to its two lone pairs. The molecule is flexible due to rotation around the single bonds.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** We must consider the molecule's most stable, low-energy conformation.\n    *   The molecule is not linear (ruling out D∞h).\n    *   It does not have a high-symmetry shape like a square plane (ruling out D4h).\n    *   For the molecule to have C2v symmetry, it would require two mirror planes. This would force the molecule into a planar, high-energy, sterically hindered conformation.\n    *   The most stable conformation of mustard gas possesses a single two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged. It does not possess any other symmetry elements (besides identity).\n*   **Conclusion:** A molecule whose only symmetry element is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\nA) C2\nB) D∞h\nC) C2v\nD) D4h\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires identifying a series of unknown substances to determine the molecular symmetry of the final product, E. I will solve this by systematically deducing the identity of each compound.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 3:** These are the most specific clues. Clue 3 states that the hydrolysis of C regenerates solid A and produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). Clue 1 gives a unique 1:8 stoichiometric ratio for the reaction between solid A and gas B to form C.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that A is sulfur. The most stable solid allotrope of sulfur is a crown-shaped ring, **S₈**. So, let's assume **A = S₈**.\n    *   Let's assume gas B is chlorine, **Cl₂**.\n    *   The reaction from Clue 1 would be: **S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)**.\n    *   This reaction perfectly matches the 1:8 stoichiometry between solid A (1 mole of S₈) and gas B (8 moles of Cl₂). The product, sulfur dichloride (**C = SCl₂**), is a cherry-red liquid, which fits the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   Now, let's verify this with Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A + F + G`. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride is: `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This reaction regenerates elemental sulfur (**A**), produces hydrochloric acid (**F = HCl**, a strong acid), and sulfur dioxide, which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (**G = H₂SO₃**, a weak acid). This is a perfect fit.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 4:** This clue states that gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent, H.\n    *   We have identified gas B as chlorine (Cl₂). So, `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`.\n    *   A very common 1:1 addition reaction that fits this description is the reaction of ethene (ethylene) with chlorine: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   The product, 1,2-dichloroethane, is a common solvent.\n    *   Therefore, we can identify **D = C₂H₄** and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 2:** This clue states that C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce the extremely hazardous product E.\n    *   We have identified C = SCl₂ and D = C₂H₄.\n    *   The reaction is: **SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E**.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The product, **S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**, is commonly known as **mustard gas**, a potent chemical warfare agent that is extremely hazardous. This confirms our identification of **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**.\n\n**Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E (Mustard Gas):**\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule E is mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂. It has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent due to its two lone pairs.\n2.  **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is flexible due to rotation around its single bonds. We must consider its most stable, low-energy conformation.\n    *   The molecule is not linear, so it cannot be D∞h.\n    *   It does not have a square planar shape or the high degree of symmetry required for D4h.\n    *   For the molecule to have C2v symmetry, it would need two mirror planes in addition to a C₂ axis. This would require the molecule to be planar, which is a high-energy, sterically hindered conformation.\n    *   The most stable conformation of mustard gas is a twisted, non-planar structure. This structure possesses a single symmetry element (besides the identity element): a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n3.  **Conclusion:** A molecule whose only symmetry element is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

Analysis of the Clues**\n\nThe problem provides four clues about a series of chemical reactions. The goal is to identify the \"extremely hazardous product E\" and determine its molecular symmetry group.\n\n*   **Clue 1:** `solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → bright red product C`\n*   **Clue 2:** `C + 2 equivalents of gas D → extremely hazardous product E`\n*   **Clue 3:** `C + H₂O → A + acid F (strong) + acid G (weak)`\n*   **Clue 4:** `D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Deduction of Chemical Identities**\n\nThe most logical approach is to start with the most specific clues and build a consistent set of identities for all the unknown compounds.\n\n*   **Start with Clues 1 and 3:** These two clues are highly constraining. Clue 3 describes a hydrolysis reaction that regenerates the starting material A, suggesting A is an element. The reaction also produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). This points towards a disproportionation reaction of a non-metal halide. Clue 1 provides a very specific 1:8 stoichiometry.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that **A is Sulfur** and **B is Chlorine (Cl₂) **.\n    *   The most stable allotrope of solid sulfur is the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**. So, **A = S₈**.\n    *   The reaction in Clue 1 would be: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This reaction perfectly matches the 1:8 stoichiometry between solid A (S₈) and gas B (Cl₂).\n    *   The product, **C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)**, is a cherry-red liquid, which fits the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   Now, let's check this against Clue 3: the hydrolysis of SCl₂. The reaction is `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This reaction regenerates elemental sulfur (A).\n    *   It produces **HCl (Hydrochloric acid)**, which is a strong acid (**F**).\n    *   It produces SO₂, which dissolves in water to form **H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)**, a weak acid (**G**).\n    *   This set of identities is perfectly consistent with Clues 1 and 3.\n\n*   **Identify D and H using Clue 4:**\n    *   We have identified gas B as Cl₂. The clue states `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   A very common reaction that fits this description is the addition of chlorine to ethene (ethylene).\n    *   `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This reaction is 1:1. The product, **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**, is a common solvent. Gas **D = C₂H₄ (Ethene)**.\n    *   This is a very strong fit.\n\n*   **Identify E using Clue 2:**\n    *   The final clue is `C + 2D → E`.\n    *   Substituting our identified compounds: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2CH₂=CH₂ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The product, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**, is commonly known as **Mustard Gas**. Mustard gas is an infamous chemical warfare agent and is certainly an \"extremely hazardous product\". The 1:2 stoichiometry also matches the clue.\n\n**3. Summary of Identified Compounds**\n*   A = S₈ (Sulfur)\n*   B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n*   C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n*   D = C₂H₄ (Ethene)\n*   E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas)\n*   F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n*   G = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)\n*   H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\nThis set of compounds satisfies all clues in the puzzle.\n\n**4. Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\nThe final task is to find the point group for E, mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂.\n\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent due to its two lone pairs of electrons.\n*   **Conformation and Symmetry:** The molecule is flexible due to rotation around the single bonds. We must consider its most stable, low-energy conformation.\n    *   The molecule is not linear, so **D∞h** is incorrect.\n    *   The molecule does not have a square planar or other high-symmetry shape, so **D4h** is incorrect.\n    *   For the molecule to have **C2v** symmetry, it would need a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes. This would require the molecule to be planar, which would lead to high steric strain and is not the most stable conformation.\n    *   The most stable conformation of mustard gas (and similar molecules like diethyl ether) possesses a single symmetry element (other than identity): a **C₂ (two-fold) rotational axis**. This axis passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged. The molecule is chiral and lacks any mirror planes or a center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion:** A molecule whose only symmetry element is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C₂. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) D4h\nB) C2\nC) D∞h\nD) C2v\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires identifying a series of unknown substances to determine the molecular symmetry of the final product, E. The most logical approach is to use the most specific clues to build a consistent set of identities for all compounds.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`**\n    This hydrolysis reaction is the most revealing clue. The regeneration of solid A suggests it's an element, and the formation of two different acids (one strong, one weak) from a single compound C is characteristic of the hydrolysis of a sulfur halide.\n    Let's test the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    This reaction fits the clue perfectly:\n    *   **A = S** (Sulfur), a solid.\n    *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid), a strong acid.\n    *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid), a weak acid formed when SO₂ dissolves in water.\n    *   This implies **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride).\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1: `A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red)`**\n    Let's verify our identities with this clue.\n    *   A = Sulfur. The stable allotrope of sulfur at standard conditions is a crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   B must be chlorine gas, **Cl₂**.\n    *   C = SCl₂. Sulfur dichloride is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   Now, let's check the stoichiometry: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This balanced equation shows that 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (Cl₂). This is a perfect match for the clue and strongly validates our hypothesis.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 4: `D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent) [1:1 ratio]`**\n    We have identified B as chlorine gas (Cl₂).\n    *   `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`\n    *   A common 1:1 addition reaction that fits this is the chlorination of ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   The product, 1,2-dichloroethane, is a common industrial solvent.\n    *   This identifies: **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene) and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane).\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2: `C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous)`**\n    We can now identify the final product, E.\n    *   C = SCl₂\n    *   D = C₂H₄\n    *   The reaction is: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing **bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide**, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   This product is commonly known as **Mustard Gas**, an infamous chemical warfare agent, which perfectly fits the description \"extremely hazardous\".\n    *   Therefore, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas)**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E (Mustard Gas)**\n    The final step is to determine the point group of mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups, with a bent geometry at the sulfur.\n    *   The molecule is not linear (ruling out D∞h) or square planar (ruling out D4h).\n    *   The choice is between C₂ and C₂v. A C₂v point group would require the molecule to have two mirror planes, which would force it into a high-energy, sterically hindered conformation.\n    *   The most stable, low-energy conformation of mustard gas lacks mirror planes but possesses a single two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n    *   A molecule whose only symmetry element (besides identity) is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) C₂\nB) C₂v\nC) D∞h\nD) D₄h\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances, ultimately leading to the molecular structure and symmetry of product E.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Clues:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    This hydrolysis reaction is the most chemically specific clue. The regeneration of solid A suggests it's an element, and C is a compound of that element. The formation of two different acids, one strong and one weak, points towards the hydrolysis of a non-metal halide. A classic example is the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    This reaction fits the description perfectly:\n    *   **A** is elemental **Sulfur (S)**, a solid.\n    *   **F** is **Hydrochloric acid (HCl)**, a strong acid.\n    *   **G** is **Sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃)**, a weak acid formed when the gaseous product SO₂ dissolves in water.\n    *   This implies that **C** is **Sulfur dichloride (SCl₂)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    Let's test our assignments from Step 1.\n    *   A = Sulfur. The most stable allotrope of sulfur at standard conditions is a crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   B must be Chlorine gas, **Cl₂**.\n    *   C is Sulfur dichloride, **SCl₂**, which is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   Now, let's check the stoichiometry:\n        `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`\n    *   This balanced equation shows that one mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (Cl₂).

There are two primary interpretations presented in the candidate answers, one leading to mustard gas and the other to phosgene.\n\n**Path 1: The Mustard Gas Hypothesis**\n\nThis path provides the most consistent explanation for all clues.\n\n*   **Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    *   This is well-explained by the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride: `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This identifies:\n        *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride)\n        *   **A = S** (Sulfur, a solid)\n        *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid)\n        *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid, a weak acid formed from SO₂ in water)\n\n*   **Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    *   This clue strongly supports the sulfur-based identity. The stable allotrope of solid sulfur is a crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   The reaction is: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This perfectly matches the 1:8 stoichiometry.\n    *   It identifies **A = S₈** and **B = Cl₂**.\n    *   Sulfur dichloride (C) is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n\n*   **Clue 4: `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`**\n    *   With B = Cl₂, a common 1:1 reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethene.\n    *   `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This identifies **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene) and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane), a common solvent.\n\n*   **Clue 2: `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`**\n    *   Substituting the identified compounds: `SCl₂ (C) + 2C₂H₄ (D) → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing **mustard gas**: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   Mustard gas is an infamous chemical warfare agent, fitting the description \"extremely hazardous\".\n    *   This confirms **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas)**.\n\nThis path is internally consistent and satisfies every clue precisely.\n\n**Path 2: The Phosgene Hypothesis**\n\nThis path, while plausible, has more inconsistencies. For example, several different starting materials (Iodine, Gold, C₆₀) are proposed for A, and none of the proposed reactions perfectly match the 1:8 stoichiometry given in Clue 1, which is a very specific detail. The mustard gas path provides a perfect explanation for this clue.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E\n\nHaving confidently identified **E as mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**, the next step is to determine its molecular symmetry (point group).\n\n1.  **Molecular Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent due to its two lone pairs of electrons.\n2.  **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is flexible due to rotation around its single bonds. We must consider its most stable, low-energy conformation.\n    *   The molecule is not linear, so it cannot be **D∞h**.\n    *   The molecule does not have a square planar structure, so it cannot be **D4h**.\n    *   For the molecule to have **C2v** symmetry, it would require two mirror planes.

The regeneration of the starting solid `A` suggests `A` is an element, and `C` is a compound of that element which disproportionates in water. The production of a strong acid and a weak acid points towards the hydrolysis of a non-metal halide. A classic example that fits perfectly is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride.\n    *   Let's test the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂): `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This reaction regenerates elemental sulfur (`A`), which is a solid.\n    *   It produces hydrochloric acid (`F`), which is a strong acid.\n    *   It produces sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid, H₂SO₃ (`G`), a weak acid.\n    *   This hypothesis fits perfectly. Thus: **A = S (Sulfur)**, **C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)**, **F = HCl**, and **G = H₂SO₃**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    We can now test our hypothesis with this clue.\n    *   `A` is sulfur. In its stable solid form at standard conditions, sulfur exists as the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   `C` is sulfur dichloride, SCl₂. This compound is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   The reaction requires a source of chlorine, so gas `B` must be **Cl₂**.\n    *   Let's check the stoichiometry: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This balanced equation shows that one mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (Cl₂). This provides very strong confirmation for our identities of A, B, and C.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 4: `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`**\n    We have identified gas `B` as Cl₂.\n    *   The reaction is `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   A very common industrial reaction that fits this description is the chlorination of ethene (ethylene).\n    *   `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This reaction is 1:1, and the product, 1,2-dichloroethane, is a widely used solvent.\n    *   This allows us to identify: **D = C₂H₄ (Ethene)** and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2: `C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`**\n    We can now determine the identity of the final product, E.\n    *   The reaction is `C + 2D → E`.\n    *   Substituting our identified compounds: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2CH₂=CH₂ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The product, **S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**, is the chemical warfare agent commonly known as **mustard gas**. It is infamous for being an \"extremely hazardous product\".\n    *   Therefore, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas)**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n    The final step is to determine the point group (molecular symmetry group) of mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂.\n    *   The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur is bent due to its two lone pairs.\n    *   The molecule is not linear (ruling out D∞h) or highly symmetric like a square planar molecule (ruling out D4h).\n    *   For the molecule to have C2v symmetry, it would require two mirror planes. This would force the molecule into a planar, high-energy, eclipsed conformation, which is not its stable state.\n    *   The most stable, low-energy conformation of mustard gas possesses only one symmetry element besides the identity element: a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n    *   A molecule whose only symmetry element is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) C2\nB) D4h\nC) C2v\nD) D∞h\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Chemical Puzzle**\n\nThe core of the task is to identify the \"extremely hazardous product E\" by solving a chemical puzzle. The most logical approach is to use the most specific clues first to identify some of the compounds, and then use those identities to solve the rest of the puzzle.\n\n*   **Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    This hydrolysis reaction is the most revealing clue. The regeneration of the starting solid `A` and the production of two distinct acids (one strong, one weak) points towards a specific type of disproportionation reaction. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) is a classic example that fits this description perfectly:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    Let's map this to the clue:\n    *   `C` is **`SCl₂`** (Sulfur dichloride).\n    *   `A` is elemental **`S`** (Sulfur), a solid.\n    *   `F` is **`HCl`** (Hydrochloric acid), a strong acid.\n    *   `G` is **`H₂SO₃`** (Sulfurous acid), a weak acid formed when `SO₂` dissolves in water.\n\n*   **Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    This clue provides a powerful confirmation of our hypothesis.\n    *   We identified `A` as Sulfur. The most stable solid allotrope of sulfur at standard conditions is the crown-shaped ring, **`S₈`**.\n    *   We identified `C` as `SCl₂`, which is described as a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   The gas `B` must therefore be **`Cl₂`** (Chlorine).\n    *   Now, let's check the stoichiometry: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This balanced equation shows that 1 mole of solid `A` (`S₈`) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas `B` (`Cl₂`). This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Clue 4: `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`**\n    We can now use our known identities to solve this.\n    *   `B` is `Cl₂`. So, gas `D` reacts with `Cl₂` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   A very common industrial reaction that fits this is the addition of chlorine to ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This reaction is 1:1, and the product, 1,2-dichloroethane (`C₂H₄Cl₂`), is a widely used solvent.\n    *   This allows us to identify: `D` = **`C₂H₄`** (Ethene) and `H` = **`C₂H₄Cl₂`**.\n\n*   **Clue 2: `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`**\n    This is the final step to identify `E`.\n    *   `C` is `SCl₂`.\n    *   `D` is `C₂H₄`.\n    *   The reaction is: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of **bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide**, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   This product is commonly known as **Mustard Gas**, a potent and infamous chemical warfare agent, which perfectly fits the description \"extremely hazardous product\".\n    *   Therefore, **`E` is Mustard Gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`**.\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\nNow that we have confidently identified `E` as mustard gas, we must determine its molecular symmetry group (point group).\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent due to its two lone pairs of electrons.

We consider its most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n    *   **Rotational Axis (Cₙ):** The molecule possesses a two-fold rotational axis (`C₂`) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n    *   **Mirror Planes (σ):** The molecule lacks any mirror planes in its stable conformation. For a mirror plane to exist, the molecule would have to adopt a much higher-energy, sterically hindered shape.\n    *   **Inversion Center (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule whose only symmetry element (other than the identity element E) is a single `C₂` axis belongs to the **`C₂`** point group.\n\n**3.

The most effective approach is to find the most specific clue and build a consistent hypothesis.\n\n*   **Clue 1:** `solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → bright red product C`\n*   **Clue 2:** `C + 2 equivalents of gas D → extremely hazardous product E`\n*   **Clue 3:** `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`\n*   **Clue 4:** `D + B → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio`\n\n**2. Identifying the Core Chemicals**\n\nThe combination of Clues 1 and 3 is the most powerful starting point.\n*   Clue 3 describes a hydrolysis reaction where C reacts with water to regenerate the starting solid A, while also producing a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). This suggests a disproportionation reaction where the central element of C is both reduced (back to element A) and oxidized (to form the precursor of weak acid G).\n*   A well-known reaction that fits this pattern is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride: `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This identifies the strong acid **F** as **HCl** (hydrochloric acid).\n    *   The gas SO₂ dissolves in water to form the weak acid **G**, **H₂SO₃** (sulfurous acid).\n    *   The regenerated solid **A** is elemental **Sulfur (S)**.\n    *   The reactant **C** is **SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride).\n\n*   Now, let's verify this with Clue 1.\n    *   We have A = Sulfur, B must be Chlorine (Cl₂), and C = SCl₂.\n    *   Sulfur's most stable allotrope at standard conditions is a solid, crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   The reaction is: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This reaction shows that 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with exactly **8 equivalents** of gas B (Cl₂). This perfectly matches the stoichiometry given in the clue.\n    *   Furthermore, SCl₂ is a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red product\" description.\n\n*   Next, let's use Clue 4 to identify D and H.\n    *   We know B = Cl₂. The reaction is `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   A very common industrial reaction that fits this is the addition of chlorine to ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This identifies gas **D** as **C₂H₄** (ethene/ethylene) and the solvent **H** as **C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane).\n\n*   Finally, we use Clue 2 to identify the hazardous product E.\n    *   The reaction is `C + 2D → E`.\n    *   Substituting our identified compounds: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing **bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide**, `(ClCH₂CH₂)₂S`.\n    *   This product is commonly known as **Mustard Gas**, an infamous chemical warfare agent, which perfectly fits the description \"extremely hazardous product\".\n    *   Therefore, **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n\n**3.

Let's verify it against each clue:\n    *   **Identities**:\n        *   A = **S₈** (the stable allotrope of solid sulfur)\n        *   B = **Cl₂** (chlorine gas)\n        *   C = **SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride)\n        *   D = **C₂H₄** (ethene/ethylene gas)\n        *   E = **(ClCH₂CH₂)₂S** (mustard gas)\n        *   F = **HCl** (hydrochloric acid)\n        *   G = **H₂SO₃** (sulfurous acid)\n        *   H = **C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane)\n    *   **Clue 3 Check**: `C + H₂O → A + F + G`. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (`2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`) produces elemental sulfur (A), hydrochloric acid (F, a strong acid), and sulfurous acid (G, a weak acid from SO₂ dissolving in water). This is a perfect fit.\n    *   **Clue 1 Check**: `solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → bright red product C`. The reaction `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)` perfectly matches the 1:8 stoichiometry. Sulfur dichloride (C) is also known to be a cherry-red liquid, fitting the \"bright red\" description. This is a very strong piece of evidence for this pathway.\n    *   **Clue 4 Check**: `D + B → H (1:1 ratio)`. The reaction `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)` is a 1:1 reaction between two gases (D and B) to form a common solvent (H). This is also a perfect fit.\n    *   **Clue 2 Check**: `C + 2 equivalents of gas D → extremely hazardous product E`. The reaction `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S` is the Levinstein process for synthesizing mustard gas (E), a notoriously hazardous chemical warfare agent. The 1:2 stoichiometry is correct. This is a perfect fit.\n\n3.  **The \"Phosgene/Carbonyl Halide\" Pathway (e.g., Answers 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11)**\n    This pathway identifies E as `COCl₂`, `COF₂`, or `ClF₃`. While these are all hazardous substances, this pathway struggles to satisfy all the clues simultaneously. Its primary weakness is **Clue 1**, the 1:8 stoichiometry. None of the proposed identities for A and B in this pathway (`C₆₀/Cl₂`, `I₂/Cl₂`, `Au/BrCl`, etc.) have a simple, known reaction that fits the 1:8 ratio. Proponents of this path must assume the stoichiometry is an error, which is a less rigorous approach than finding a solution that fits all data.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Identity**: The \"Mustard Gas\" pathway provides a consistent and elegant solution that fits every single clue, including the specific stoichiometry. Therefore, we can confidently identify **E as mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E\n\n*   **Molecule**: E = Mustard Gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n*   **Structure**: The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. The C-S-C linkage is bent due to the two lone pairs on the sulfur atom. The molecule is not planar.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   The molecule is not linear, so **D∞h** is incorrect.\n    *   The molecule does not have a square planar shape or the high symmetry required for **D4h**, so it is incorrect.\n    *   For the molecule to have **C₂v** symmetry, it would need a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes. The presence of mirror planes would require the molecule to adopt a very high-energy, sterically hindered conformation. In its stable, low-energy conformations, it lacks mirror planes.\n    *   The most stable conformations of mustard gas possess a single symmetry element (other than identity): a **C₂** (two-fold) rotational axis. This axis passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n\n*   **Final Point Group**: The molecular symmetry group for mustard gas is **C₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Match with Options\n\nThe determined molecular symmetry group is **C₂**. This corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n*   A) D∞h\n*   B) D4h\n*   **C) C₂**\n*   D) C₂v\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances and ultimately determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Clues and Formulate a Hypothesis**\n\nThe most informative clues are often the most specific ones.\n*   **Clue 3:** \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\" This describes a hydrolysis reaction where the starting material, A, is an element that is regenerated. This suggests a disproportionation reaction of a compound of element A.\n*   **Clue 1:** \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\" The 1:8 stoichiometry is a very strong hint.\n\nLet's build a hypothesis around these clues. A well-known chemical reaction that fits Clue 3 is the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n`2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n\nLet's see if this fits the description:\n*   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride). It is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches \"bright red product\".\n*   **A = S** (Sulfur). It is a solid, and it is reformed in the reaction.\n*   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid). This is a strong acid.\n*   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid). This is a weak acid, formed when the gaseous product SO₂ dissolves in water.\nThis hypothesis is a perfect match for Clue 3.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Hypothesis with Other Clues**\n\nNow, let's check this hypothesis against the other clues.\n\n*   **Verifying with Clue 1:** \"solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"\n    *   We have A = Sulfur and C = SCl₂. The reaction requires chlorine gas, so **B = Cl₂**.\n    *   The stable form of solid sulfur at standard conditions is the crown-shaped octasulfur ring, **S₈**.\n    *   Let's write the balanced equation: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This equation shows that 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (Cl₂). This perfectly matches the stoichiometry given in the clue.\n\n*   **Verifying with Clue 4:** \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\n    *   We know B = Cl₂. So, a gas D reacts with Cl₂ in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent H.\n    *   A very common industrial reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This is a 1:1 reaction, and the product, 1,2-dichloroethane, is a widely used solvent.\n    *   This allows us to identify: **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene) and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane).\n\n*   **Verifying with Clue 2:** \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n    *   We have C = SCl₂ and D = C₂H₄.\n    *   The reaction is: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S`.\n    *   The product, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S, is commonly known as **Mustard Gas**, a chemical warfare agent that is extremely hazardous.\n    *   This confirms our identification: **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\nThe final task is to determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E, which is mustard gas.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent due to its two lone pairs of electrons.\n*   **Conformation:** The molecule is flexible due to rotation around the single bonds. We must consider its most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   The molecule is not linear (ruling out D∞h).\n    *   It does not have the high symmetry of a square planar molecule (ruling out D4h).\n    *   For the molecule to have C₂v symmetry, it would need a C₂ axis and two mirror planes. The presence of mirror planes would require the molecule to adopt a sterically unfavorable eclipsed conformation. In its staggered, low-energy state, it lacks mirror planes.\n    *   The most stable conformation of mustard gas possesses a single two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable from its original state.\n*   **Conclusion:** A molecule that possesses only an identity element (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying the unknown substances. There are two primary plausible interpretations of the clues, but one provides a more complete and elegant solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Clues and Identify Key Reactions**\n\n*   **Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    This hydrolysis reaction, which regenerates the starting solid `A`, is a powerful clue. It suggests a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Clue 1: `solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → bright red product C`**\n    The 1:8 stoichiometry is a very specific detail and likely crucial for solving the puzzle correctly.\n*   **Clue 4: `D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent)`**\n    This is a simple 1:1 addition reaction to form a solvent.\n*   **Clue 2: `C + 2 equivalents of gas D → extremely hazardous product E`**\n    This reaction forms the target molecule, E.\n\n**Step 2: Follow the Most Consistent Interpretation**\n\nThe most consistent interpretation hinges on solving the 1:8 stoichiometry in Clue 1.\n\n1.  Let's start with the hydrolysis in **Clue 3**. A well-known reaction that fits the description is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    This fits perfectly:\n    *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride)\n    *   **A = S** (Elemental sulfur, a solid)\n    *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid)\n    *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid, a weak acid formed when SO₂ dissolves in water)\n\n2.  Now, let's test this against **Clue 1**. We need to form `C` (SCl₂) from `A` (Sulfur) and a gas `B` with a 1:8 ratio.\n    *   The stable form of solid sulfur at standard conditions is the crown-shaped octasulfur ring, **S₈**.\n    *   The gas `B` must therefore be chlorine, **Cl₂**.\n    *   The balanced reaction is: **S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)**\n    *   This reaction shows that 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (Cl₂). This perfectly explains the stoichiometry. Additionally, sulfur dichloride (C) is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n\n3.  Next, we use **Clue 4** to identify `D` and `H`. We know `B` is Cl₂.\n    *   `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`\n    *   A common 1:1 addition reaction is the chlorination of ethene: **C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)**\n    *   The product, 1,2-dichloroethane, is a common solvent. This fits the clue perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene) and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane).\n\n4.  Finally, we use **Clue 2** to identify the hazardous product `E`.\n    *   `C (SCl₂) + 2D (C₂H₄) → E`\n    *   The reaction is: **SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing **bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide**, more commonly known as **Mustard Gas**. Mustard gas is an infamous chemical warfare agent and is extremely hazardous.\n    *   Thus, **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S (Mustard Gas)**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\nThe final task is to determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E, mustard gas.\n\n*   The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups, with a bent geometry at the sulfur atom.\n*   The molecule is not linear, ruling out **D∞h**.\n*   It does not have the high symmetry of a square planar molecule, ruling out **D4h**.\n*   For the molecule to have **C2v** symmetry, it would need to possess two mirror planes in addition to a C₂ axis. This would require the molecule to be planar, which is a high-energy, unstable conformation due to steric hindrance.\n*   The most stable, low-energy conformation of mustard gas possesses only one symmetry element (besides the identity element): a two-fold rotational axis (**C₂**) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n*   A molecule whose only symmetry element is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) D4h\nB) C2v\nC) D∞h\nD) C2\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is C₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances and ultimately determine the molecular symmetry of product E. The most logical approach is to find a single, consistent set of chemical identities that satisfies all the given clues.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Clues to Find the Most Consistent Chemical Pathway**\n\nThere are two main interpretations presented by the candidate answers, but one is significantly more consistent and chemically sound.\n\n*   **Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    This hydrolysis reaction is a powerful clue. The regeneration of solid A suggests it's an element, and the formation of two different acids points towards a disproportionation reaction. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) fits this perfectly:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    This allows us to hypothesize:\n    *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride). It is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   **A = S** (Sulfur), a solid element.\n    *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid), a strong acid.\n    *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid), a weak acid formed when `SO₂` dissolves in water.\n\n*   **Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    Let's test our hypothesis with this clue. The stable allotrope of solid sulfur (A) at standard conditions is the crown-shaped `S₈` ring. The gas B would be chlorine (`Cl₂`).\n    The balanced chemical equation is:\n    `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`\n    This reaction shows that 1 mole of solid A (`S₈`) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (`Cl₂`). This perfect stoichiometric match strongly supports our initial hypothesis.\n\n*   **Clue 4: `D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio**\n    We have identified B as chlorine (`Cl₂`). We need a gas D that reacts 1:1 with chlorine to form a solvent. A very common industrial reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethene:\n    `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    This fits perfectly:\n    *   **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene/Ethylene).\n    *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane), a widely used solvent.\n\n*   **Clue 2: `C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`**\n    Now we use our identified compounds to find E:\n    `C (SCl₂) + 2D (2C₂H₄) → E`\n    This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide:\n    `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`\n    The product, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`, is commonly known as **mustard gas**, a potent and infamous chemical warfare agent. This fits the description of an \"extremely hazardous product\" perfectly.\n    *   **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas)**\n\nThis pathway provides a consistent identity for every compound that fits every clue, including the specific stoichiometry.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E (Mustard Gas)**\n\nThe final task is to determine the point group (molecular symmetry group) for mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent due to its two lone pairs of electrons.\n2.  **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is not linear, so **D∞h** is incorrect.\n    *   The molecule does not have a square planar shape or the high degree of symmetry required for the **D4h** point group.\n    *   For the molecule to have **C₂v** symmetry, it would need a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes. This would require the molecule to be planar, which is a high-energy, sterically hindered conformation. Therefore, C₂v is incorrect for the stable structure.\n    *   The most stable, low-energy conformation of mustard gas possesses a single symmetry element (besides the identity element): a two-fold rotational axis (**C₂**) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable from its starting position.\n\nA molecule whose only symmetry element is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical puzzle consistently leads to the identification of E as mustard gas.

Analysis of Clue 3: The Hydrolysis Reaction**\n*   **Clue:** `C + H₂O → A (solid) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`\n*   **Reasoning:** This is the most chemically specific clue. A single compound `C` hydrolyzes to regenerate the starting solid `A` and produce two different acids. This suggests a disproportionation reaction. A classic example that fits this description is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride.\n*   **Hypothesis:** Let's test the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂): `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This reaction produces solid elemental sulfur. Let **A = Sulfur (S)**.\n    *   It produces hydrochloric acid (**F = HCl**), which is a strong acid.\n    *   It produces sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (**G = H₂SO₃**), a weak acid.\n    *   This hypothesis perfectly matches the clue. Therefore, we can tentatively identify **C = SCl₂**.\n\n**2. Analysis of Clue 1: The Formation of C**\n*   **Clue:** `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`\n*   **Reasoning:** We test our hypothesis with these identities.\n    *   A = Sulfur. The most stable allotrope of sulfur at standard conditions is a solid crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   C = SCl₂. Sulfur dichloride is a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   B must be the source of chlorine, so **B = Cl₂ (Chlorine gas)**.\n*   **Stoichiometry Check:** Let's write the balanced equation: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This equation shows that 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (Cl₂). This is a perfect and compelling match for the clue.\n\n**3. Analysis of Clue 4: The Formation of H**\n*   **Clue:** `D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Reasoning:** We know B is chlorine (Cl₂). We need a gas `D` that reacts 1:1 with chlorine to form a solvent `H`.\n*   **Hypothesis:** A common industrial reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethene (ethylene).\n    *   `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    *   This reaction fits the 1:1 stoichiometry. The product, 1,2-dichloroethane, is a widely used solvent.\n    *   Therefore, we can identify **D = C₂H₄ (Ethene)** and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**.\n\n**4. Analysis of Clue 2: The Formation of E**\n*   **Clue:** `C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n*   **Reasoning:** We substitute our identified compounds:\n    *   C = SCl₂\n    *   D = C₂H₄\n    *   The reaction is: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n*   **Identification:** This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2CH₂=CH₂ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The product, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, is commonly known as **mustard gas**, a chemical warfare agent that is extremely hazardous. This confirms our identification.\n    *   **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas)**.\n\n**5. Determination of the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n*   **Molecule:** E is mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent due to its two lone pairs. The molecule is flexible due to rotation around the single bonds.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** We must consider the molecule's most stable, low-energy conformation.\n    *   The molecule is not linear (ruling out D∞h).\n    *   It does not have a high-symmetry shape like a square plane (ruling out D4h).\n    *   For the molecule to have C2v symmetry, it would require two mirror planes. This would force the molecule into a planar, high-energy, sterically hindered conformation.\n    *   The most stable conformation of mustard gas possesses a single two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged. It does not possess any other symmetry elements (besides identity).\n*   **Conclusion:** A molecule whose only symmetry element is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\nA) C2\nB) D∞h\nC) C2v\nD) D4h\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires identifying a series of unknown substances to determine the molecular symmetry of the final product, E. I will solve this by systematically deducing the identity of each compound.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 3:** These are the most specific clues. Clue 3 states that the hydrolysis of C regenerates solid A and produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). Clue 1 gives a unique 1:8 stoichiometric ratio for the reaction between solid A and gas B to form C.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that A is sulfur. The most stable solid allotrope of sulfur is a crown-shaped ring, **S₈**. So, let's assume **A = S₈**.\n    *   Let's assume gas B is chlorine, **Cl₂**.\n    *   The reaction from Clue 1 would be: **S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)**.\n    *   This reaction perfectly matches the 1:8 stoichiometry between solid A (1 mole of S₈) and gas B (8 moles of Cl₂). The product, sulfur dichloride (**C = SCl₂**), is a cherry-red liquid, which fits the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   Now, let's verify this with Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A + F + G`. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride is: `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This reaction regenerates elemental sulfur (**A**), produces hydrochloric acid (**F = HCl**, a strong acid), and sulfur dioxide, which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (**G = H₂SO₃**, a weak acid). This is a perfect fit.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 4:** This clue states that gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent, H.\n    *   We have identified gas B as chlorine (Cl₂). So, `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`.\n    *   A very common 1:1 addition reaction that fits this description is the reaction of ethene (ethylene) with chlorine: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   The product, 1,2-dichloroethane, is a common solvent.\n    *   Therefore, we can identify **D = C₂H₄** and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 2:** This clue states that C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce the extremely hazardous product E.\n    *   We have identified C = SCl₂ and D = C₂H₄.\n    *   The reaction is: **SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E**.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The product, **S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**, is commonly known as **mustard gas**, a potent chemical warfare agent that is extremely hazardous. This confirms our identification of **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**.\n\n**Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E (Mustard Gas):**\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule E is mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂. It has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent due to its two lone pairs.\n2.  **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is flexible due to rotation around its single bonds. We must consider its most stable, low-energy conformation.\n    *   The molecule is not linear, so it cannot be D∞h.\n    *   It does not have a square planar shape or the high degree of symmetry required for D4h.\n    *   For the molecule to have C2v symmetry, it would need two mirror planes in addition to a C₂ axis. This would require the molecule to be planar, which is a high-energy, sterically hindered conformation.\n    *   The most stable conformation of mustard gas is a twisted, non-planar structure. This structure possesses a single symmetry element (besides the identity element): a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n3.  **Conclusion:** A molecule whose only symmetry element is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

Analysis of the Clues**\n\nThe problem provides four clues about a series of chemical reactions. The goal is to identify the \"extremely hazardous product E\" and determine its molecular symmetry group.\n\n*   **Clue 1:** `solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → bright red product C`\n*   **Clue 2:** `C + 2 equivalents of gas D → extremely hazardous product E`\n*   **Clue 3:** `C + H₂O → A + acid F (strong) + acid G (weak)`\n*   **Clue 4:** `D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Deduction of Chemical Identities**\n\nThe most logical approach is to start with the most specific clues and build a consistent set of identities for all the unknown compounds.\n\n*   **Start with Clues 1 and 3:** These two clues are highly constraining. Clue 3 describes a hydrolysis reaction that regenerates the starting material A, suggesting A is an element. The reaction also produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). This points towards a disproportionation reaction of a non-metal halide. Clue 1 provides a very specific 1:8 stoichiometry.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that **A is Sulfur** and **B is Chlorine (Cl₂) **.\n    *   The most stable allotrope of solid sulfur is the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**. So, **A = S₈**.\n    *   The reaction in Clue 1 would be: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This reaction perfectly matches the 1:8 stoichiometry between solid A (S₈) and gas B (Cl₂).\n    *   The product, **C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)**, is a cherry-red liquid, which fits the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   Now, let's check this against Clue 3: the hydrolysis of SCl₂. The reaction is `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This reaction regenerates elemental sulfur (A).\n    *   It produces **HCl (Hydrochloric acid)**, which is a strong acid (**F**).\n    *   It produces SO₂, which dissolves in water to form **H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)**, a weak acid (**G**).\n    *   This set of identities is perfectly consistent with Clues 1 and 3.\n\n*   **Identify D and H using Clue 4:**\n    *   We have identified gas B as Cl₂. The clue states `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   A very common reaction that fits this description is the addition of chlorine to ethene (ethylene).\n    *   `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This reaction is 1:1. The product, **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**, is a common solvent. Gas **D = C₂H₄ (Ethene)**.\n    *   This is a very strong fit.\n\n*   **Identify E using Clue 2:**\n    *   The final clue is `C + 2D → E`.\n    *   Substituting our identified compounds: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2CH₂=CH₂ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The product, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**, is commonly known as **Mustard Gas**. Mustard gas is an infamous chemical warfare agent and is certainly an \"extremely hazardous product\". The 1:2 stoichiometry also matches the clue.\n\n**3. Summary of Identified Compounds**\n*   A = S₈ (Sulfur)\n*   B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n*   C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n*   D = C₂H₄ (Ethene)\n*   E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas)\n*   F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n*   G = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)\n*   H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\nThis set of compounds satisfies all clues in the puzzle.\n\n**4. Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\nThe final task is to find the point group for E, mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂.\n\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent due to its two lone pairs of electrons.\n*   **Conformation and Symmetry:** The molecule is flexible due to rotation around the single bonds. We must consider its most stable, low-energy conformation.\n    *   The molecule is not linear, so **D∞h** is incorrect.\n    *   The molecule does not have a square planar or other high-symmetry shape, so **D4h** is incorrect.\n    *   For the molecule to have **C2v** symmetry, it would need a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes. This would require the molecule to be planar, which would lead to high steric strain and is not the most stable conformation.\n    *   The most stable conformation of mustard gas (and similar molecules like diethyl ether) possesses a single symmetry element (other than identity): a **C₂ (two-fold) rotational axis**. This axis passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged. The molecule is chiral and lacks any mirror planes or a center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion:** A molecule whose only symmetry element is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**5.

The regeneration of solid A suggests it's an element, and the formation of two different acids (one strong, one weak) from a single compound C is characteristic of the hydrolysis of a sulfur halide.\n    Let's test the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    This reaction fits the clue perfectly:\n    *   **A = S** (Sulfur), a solid.\n    *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid), a strong acid.\n    *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid), a weak acid formed when SO₂ dissolves in water.\n    *   This implies **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride).\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1: `A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red)`**\n    Let's verify our identities with this clue.\n    *   A = Sulfur.

This is a perfect match for the clue.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 4: `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`**\n    We have identified B as Chlorine (Cl₂).

There are two primary interpretations presented in the candidate answers, one leading to mustard gas and the other to phosgene.\n\n**Path 1: The Mustard Gas Hypothesis**\n\nThis path provides the most consistent explanation for all clues.\n\n*   **Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    *   This is well-explained by the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride: `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This identifies:\n        *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride)\n        *   **A = S** (Sulfur, a solid)\n        *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid)\n        *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid, a weak acid formed from SO₂ in water)\n\n*   **Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    *   This clue strongly supports the sulfur-based identity. The stable allotrope of solid sulfur is a crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   The reaction is: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This perfectly matches the 1:8 stoichiometry.\n    *   It identifies **A = S₈** and **B = Cl₂**.\n    *   Sulfur dichloride (C) is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n\n*   **Clue 4: `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`**\n    *   With B = Cl₂, a common 1:1 reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethene.\n    *   `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This identifies **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene) and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane), a common solvent.\n\n*   **Clue 2: `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`**\n    *   Substituting the identified compounds: `SCl₂ (C) + 2C₂H₄ (D) → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing **mustard gas**: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   Mustard gas is an infamous chemical warfare agent, fitting the description \"extremely hazardous\".\n    *   This confirms **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas)**.\n\nThis path is internally consistent and satisfies every clue precisely.\n\n**Path 2: The Phosgene Hypothesis**\n\nThis path, while plausible, has more inconsistencies. For example, several different starting materials (Iodine, Gold, C₆₀) are proposed for A, and none of the proposed reactions perfectly match the 1:8 stoichiometry given in Clue 1, which is a very specific detail. The mustard gas path provides a perfect explanation for this clue.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E\n\nHaving confidently identified **E as mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**, the next step is to determine its molecular symmetry (point group).\n\n1.  **Molecular Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent due to its two lone pairs of electrons.\n2.  **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is flexible due to rotation around its single bonds. We must consider its most stable, low-energy conformation.\n    *   The molecule is not linear, so it cannot be **D∞h**.\n    *   The molecule does not have a square planar structure, so it cannot be **D4h**.\n    *   For the molecule to have **C2v** symmetry, it would require two mirror planes. This would force the molecule into a planar, high-energy conformation with significant steric hindrance. Therefore, C2v is incorrect for the stable structure.\n    *   The most stable conformation of mustard gas (and similar molecules like diethyl ether) possesses a single symmetry element: a two-fold rotational axis (**C₂**) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** A molecule that possesses only an identity element (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n### Step 3: Select the Final Answer\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is **C₂**. Matching this result with the provided options:\nA) D∞h\nB) C2v\nC) D4h\nD) C2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires identifying a series of unknown substances (A-H) based on their reactions to ultimately determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the clues:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    This hydrolysis reaction is a powerful clue. The regeneration of the starting solid `A` suggests `A` is an element, and `C` is a compound of that element which disproportionates in water. The production of a strong acid and a weak acid points towards the hydrolysis of a non-metal halide. A classic example that fits perfectly is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride.\n    *   Let's test the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂): `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This reaction regenerates elemental sulfur (`A`), which is a solid.\n    *   It produces hydrochloric acid (`F`), which is a strong acid.\n    *   It produces sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid, H₂SO₃ (`G`), a weak acid.\n    *   This hypothesis fits perfectly. Thus: **A = S (Sulfur)**, **C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)**, **F = HCl**, and **G = H₂SO₃**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    We can now test our hypothesis with this clue.\n    *   `A` is sulfur. In its stable solid form at standard conditions, sulfur exists as the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   `C` is sulfur dichloride, SCl₂. This compound is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   The reaction requires a source of chlorine, so gas `B` must be **Cl₂**.\n    *   Let's check the stoichiometry: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This balanced equation shows that one mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (Cl₂). This provides very strong confirmation for our identities of A, B, and C.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 4: `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`**\n    We have identified gas `B` as Cl₂.\n    *   The reaction is `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   A very common industrial reaction that fits this description is the chlorination of ethene (ethylene).\n    *   `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This reaction is 1:1, and the product, 1,2-dichloroethane, is a widely used solvent.\n    *   This allows us to identify: **D = C₂H₄ (Ethene)** and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2: `C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`**\n    We can now determine the identity of the final product, E.\n    *   The reaction is `C + 2D → E`.\n    *   Substituting our identified compounds: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2CH₂=CH₂ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The product, **S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**, is the chemical warfare agent commonly known as **mustard gas**. It is infamous for being an \"extremely hazardous product\".\n    *   Therefore, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas)**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n    The final step is to determine the point group (molecular symmetry group) of mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂.\n    *   The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur is bent due to its two lone pairs.\n    *   The molecule is not linear (ruling out D∞h) or highly symmetric like a square planar molecule (ruling out D4h).\n    *   For the molecule to have C2v symmetry, it would require two mirror planes. This would force the molecule into a planar, high-energy, eclipsed conformation, which is not its stable state.\n    *   The most stable, low-energy conformation of mustard gas possesses only one symmetry element besides the identity element: a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n    *   A molecule whose only symmetry element is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) C2\nB) D4h\nC) C2v\nD) D∞h\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Chemical Puzzle**\n\nThe core of the task is to identify the \"extremely hazardous product E\" by solving a chemical puzzle. The most logical approach is to use the most specific clues first to identify some of the compounds, and then use those identities to solve the rest of the puzzle.\n\n*   **Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    This hydrolysis reaction is the most revealing clue. The regeneration of the starting solid `A` and the production of two distinct acids (one strong, one weak) points towards a specific type of disproportionation reaction. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) is a classic example that fits this description perfectly:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    Let's map this to the clue:\n    *   `C` is **`SCl₂`** (Sulfur dichloride).\n    *   `A` is elemental **`S`** (Sulfur), a solid.\n    *   `F` is **`HCl`** (Hydrochloric acid), a strong acid.\n    *   `G` is **`H₂SO₃`** (Sulfurous acid), a weak acid formed when `SO₂` dissolves in water.\n\n*   **Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    This clue provides a powerful confirmation of our hypothesis.\n    *   We identified `A` as Sulfur. The most stable solid allotrope of sulfur at standard conditions is the crown-shaped ring, **`S₈`**.\n    *   We identified `C` as `SCl₂`, which is described as a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   The gas `B` must therefore be **`Cl₂`** (Chlorine).\n    *   Now, let's check the stoichiometry: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This balanced equation shows that 1 mole of solid `A` (`S₈`) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas `B` (`Cl₂`). This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Clue 4: `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`**\n    We can now use our known identities to solve this.\n    *   `B` is `Cl₂`. So, gas `D` reacts with `Cl₂` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   A very common industrial reaction that fits this is the addition of chlorine to ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This reaction is 1:1, and the product, 1,2-dichloroethane (`C₂H₄Cl₂`), is a widely used solvent.\n    *   This allows us to identify: `D` = **`C₂H₄`** (Ethene) and `H` = **`C₂H₄Cl₂`**.\n\n*   **Clue 2: `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`**\n    This is the final step to identify `E`.\n    *   `C` is `SCl₂`.\n    *   `D` is `C₂H₄`.\n    *   The reaction is: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of **bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide**, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   This product is commonly known as **Mustard Gas**, a potent and infamous chemical warfare agent, which perfectly fits the description \"extremely hazardous product\".\n    *   Therefore, **`E` is Mustard Gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`**.\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\nNow that we have confidently identified `E` as mustard gas, we must determine its molecular symmetry group (point group).\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent due to its two lone pairs of electrons. The molecule is not planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** The molecule is flexible due to rotation around its single bonds. We consider its most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n    *   **Rotational Axis (Cₙ):** The molecule possesses a two-fold rotational axis (`C₂`) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n    *   **Mirror Planes (σ):** The molecule lacks any mirror planes in its stable conformation. For a mirror plane to exist, the molecule would have to adopt a much higher-energy, sterically hindered shape.\n    *   **Inversion Center (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule whose only symmetry element (other than the identity element E) is a single `C₂` axis belongs to the **`C₂`** point group.\n\n**3. Match with the Options**\n\nThe determined molecular symmetry group for E (mustard gas) is `C₂`. We now match this with the given options:\nA) C2v\nB) D∞h\nC) D4h\nD) C2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruction and Analysis of the Clues**\n\nThe problem is a chemical puzzle that requires identifying a series of unknown compounds (A-H) to ultimately determine the molecular symmetry of compound E. The most effective approach is to find the most specific clue and build a consistent hypothesis.\n\n*   **Clue 1:** `solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → bright red product C`\n*   **Clue 2:** `C + 2 equivalents of gas D → extremely hazardous product E`\n*   **Clue 3:** `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`\n*   **Clue 4:** `D + B → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio`\n\n**2. Identifying the Core Chemicals**\n\nThe combination of Clues 1 and 3 is the most powerful starting point.\n*   Clue 3 describes a hydrolysis reaction where C reacts with water to regenerate the starting solid A, while also producing a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). This suggests a disproportionation reaction where the central element of C is both reduced (back to element A) and oxidized (to form the precursor of weak acid G).\n*   A well-known reaction that fits this pattern is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride: `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This identifies the strong acid **F** as **HCl** (hydrochloric acid).\n    *   The gas SO₂ dissolves in water to form the weak acid **G**, **H₂SO₃** (sulfurous acid).\n    *   The regenerated solid **A** is elemental **Sulfur (S)**.\n    *   The reactant **C** is **SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride).\n\n*   Now, let's verify this with Clue 1.\n    *   We have A = Sulfur, B must be Chlorine (Cl₂), and C = SCl₂.\n    *   Sulfur's most stable allotrope at standard conditions is a solid, crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   The reaction is: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This reaction shows that 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with exactly **8 equivalents** of gas B (Cl₂). This perfectly matches the stoichiometry given in the clue.\n    *   Furthermore, SCl₂ is a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red product\" description.\n\n*   Next, let's use Clue 4 to identify D and H.\n    *   We know B = Cl₂. The reaction is `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   A very common industrial reaction that fits this is the addition of chlorine to ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This identifies gas **D** as **C₂H₄** (ethene/ethylene) and the solvent **H** as **C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane).\n\n*   Finally, we use Clue 2 to identify the hazardous product E.\n    *   The reaction is `C + 2D → E`.\n    *   Substituting our identified compounds: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing **bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide**, `(ClCH₂CH₂)₂S`.\n    *   This product is commonly known as **Mustard Gas**, an infamous chemical warfare agent, which perfectly fits the description \"extremely hazardous product\".\n    *   Therefore, **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n\n**3. Determining the Molecular Symmetry of E (Mustard Gas)**\n\nThe final step is to determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of mustard gas, `(ClCH₂CH₂)₂S`.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent due to its two lone pairs of electrons.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** The molecule is flexible due to rotation around its single bonds. We must consider its most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n    *   The molecule is not linear, so **D∞h** is incorrect.\n    *   The molecule does not have a square planar shape or the high degree of symmetry required for **D4h**, so this is incorrect.\n    *   For the molecule to have **C2v** symmetry, it would require a C₂ axis and two mirror planes. The presence of a mirror plane would force the molecule into a planar or eclipsed conformation, which is energetically unfavorable due to steric hindrance. Therefore, the stable conformer lacks mirror planes.\n    *   The most stable conformation of mustard gas possesses a single two-fold axis of rotation (**C₂**) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** A molecule whose only symmetry element (other than the identity element) is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**4. Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe identified product E is mustard gas, and its molecular symmetry group is C₂. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds, ultimately leading to the molecular structure and symmetry of product E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Clues to Identify the Compounds**\n\nThe most effective strategy is to start with the most chemically specific clues and build a consistent set of identities for all compounds.\n\n*   **Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    This hydrolysis reaction is the most revealing. The regeneration of the starting solid (A) suggests A is an element, and C is a compound of that element that undergoes disproportionation in water. A classic reaction that fits this pattern is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    This hypothesis fits perfectly:\n    *   **A** = **S** (Sulfur), a solid.\n    *   **C** = **SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride).\n    *   **F** = **HCl** (Hydrochloric acid), a strong acid.\n    *   **G** = **H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid), a weak acid formed when SO₂ dissolves in water.\n\n*   **Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    Let's verify our hypothesis.\n    *   If A is sulfur, its most stable solid allotrope is the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   If C is SCl₂, then gas B must be **Cl₂** (chlorine).\n    *   The product C, sulfur dichloride, is a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   Now, we check the stoichiometry: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This balanced equation shows that 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (Cl₂). This provides very strong confirmation for our identifications.\n\n*   **Clue 4: `D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.**\n    *   We have identified B as Cl₂. The reaction is `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`.\n    *   A common industrial reaction fitting this description is the addition of chlorine to ethene (ethylene): `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This is a 1:1 reaction, and the product, 1,2-dichloroethane, is a common solvent.\n    *   This allows us to identify: **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene) and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane).\n\n*   **Clue 2: `C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`**\n    *   We have C = SCl₂ and D = C₂H₄.\n    *   The reaction is `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing **bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide**, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   This product is commonly known as **Mustard Gas**, a potent chemical warfare agent, which perfectly fits the description \"extremely hazardous product\".\n    *   Therefore, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\nNow that we have confidently identified E as mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`, we must determine its molecular symmetry group.\n\n1.  **Molecular Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. Due to the two lone pairs on the sulfur, the C-S-C bond is bent. The molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the single bonds. We must consider the symmetry of the most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n\n2.  **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is not linear, so it cannot belong to the **D∞h** point group.\n    *   It lacks the high degree of symmetry (like a 4-fold axis) required for the **D4h** point group.\n    *   For the molecule to be **C2v**, it would need a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes. The presence of mirror planes would force the molecule into a high-energy, sterically hindered (eclipsed) conformation. The stable ground-state conformation is staggered and lacks mirror planes.\n    *   The most stable conformation of mustard gas possesses a single two-fold axis of rotation (**C₂**) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** A molecule whose only symmetry element (besides the identity element) is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nComparing this result to the given options, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem is a chemical puzzle that requires identifying a series of unknown compounds (A-H) based on their reactions to ultimately determine the molecular symmetry of compound E.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Clues\n\n1.  **Initial Assessment**: There are two main logical pathways presented in the candidate answers. One identifies E as mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`. The other identifies E as phosgene (`COCl₂`) or a related compound like carbonyl fluoride (`COF₂`) or chlorine trifluoride (`ClF₃`). To decide which path is correct, we must evaluate how well each one fits all the given clues.\n\n2.  **The \"Mustard Gas\" Pathway (e.g., Answers 1, 3, 10, 12)**\n    This pathway is the most consistent and robust. Let's verify it against each clue:\n    *   **Identities**:\n        *   A = **S₈** (the stable allotrope of solid sulfur)\n        *   B = **Cl₂** (chlorine gas)\n        *   C = **SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride)\n        *   D = **C₂H₄** (ethene/ethylene gas)\n        *   E = **(ClCH₂CH₂)₂S** (mustard gas)\n        *   F = **HCl** (hydrochloric acid)\n        *   G = **H₂SO₃** (sulfurous acid)\n        *   H = **C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane)\n    *   **Clue 3 Check**: `C + H₂O → A + F + G`. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (`2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`) produces elemental sulfur (A), hydrochloric acid (F, a strong acid), and sulfurous acid (G, a weak acid from SO₂ dissolving in water). This is a perfect fit.\n    *   **Clue 1 Check**: `solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → bright red product C`. The reaction `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)` perfectly matches the 1:8 stoichiometry. Sulfur dichloride (C) is also known to be a cherry-red liquid, fitting the \"bright red\" description. This is a very strong piece of evidence for this pathway.\n    *   **Clue 4 Check**: `D + B → H (1:1 ratio)`. The reaction `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)` is a 1:1 reaction between two gases (D and B) to form a common solvent (H). This is also a perfect fit.\n    *   **Clue 2 Check**: `C + 2 equivalents of gas D → extremely hazardous product E`. The reaction `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S` is the Levinstein process for synthesizing mustard gas (E), a notoriously hazardous chemical warfare agent. The 1:2 stoichiometry is correct. This is a perfect fit.\n\n3.  **The \"Phosgene/Carbonyl Halide\" Pathway (e.g., Answers 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11)**\n    This pathway identifies E as `COCl₂`, `COF₂`, or `ClF₃`. While these are all hazardous substances, this pathway struggles to satisfy all the clues simultaneously. Its primary weakness is **Clue 1**, the 1:8 stoichiometry. None of the proposed identities for A and B in this pathway (`C₆₀/Cl₂`, `I₂/Cl₂`, `Au/BrCl`, etc.) have a simple, known reaction that fits the 1:8 ratio. Proponents of this path must assume the stoichiometry is an error, which is a less rigorous approach than finding a solution that fits all data.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Identity**: The \"Mustard Gas\" pathway provides a consistent and elegant solution that fits every single clue, including the specific stoichiometry. Therefore, we can confidently identify **E as mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E\n\n*   **Molecule**: E = Mustard Gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n*   **Structure**: The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. The C-S-C linkage is bent due to the two lone pairs on the sulfur atom. The molecule is not planar.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   The molecule is not linear, so **D∞h** is incorrect.\n    *   The molecule does not have a square planar shape or the high symmetry required for **D4h**, so it is incorrect.\n    *   For the molecule to have **C₂v** symmetry, it would need a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes. The presence of mirror planes would require the molecule to adopt a very high-energy, sterically hindered conformation. In its stable, low-energy conformations, it lacks mirror planes.\n    *   The most stable conformations of mustard gas possess a single symmetry element (other than identity): a **C₂** (two-fold) rotational axis. This axis passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n\n*   **Final Point Group**: The molecular symmetry group for mustard gas is **C₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Match with Options\n\nThe determined molecular symmetry group is **C₂**. This corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n*   A) D∞h\n*   B) D4h\n*   **C) C₂**\n*   D) C₂v\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances and ultimately determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Clues and Formulate a Hypothesis**\n\nThe most informative clues are often the most specific ones.\n*   **Clue 3:** \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\" This describes a hydrolysis reaction where the starting material, A, is an element that is regenerated. This suggests a disproportionation reaction of a compound of element A.\n*   **Clue 1:** \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\" The 1:8 stoichiometry is a very strong hint.\n\nLet's build a hypothesis around these clues. A well-known chemical reaction that fits Clue 3 is the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n`2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n\nLet's see if this fits the description:\n*   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride). It is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches \"bright red product\".\n*   **A = S** (Sulfur). It is a solid, and it is reformed in the reaction.\n*   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid). This is a strong acid.\n*   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid). This is a weak acid, formed when the gaseous product SO₂ dissolves in water.\nThis hypothesis is a perfect match for Clue 3.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Hypothesis with Other Clues**\n\nNow, let's check this hypothesis against the other clues.\n\n*   **Verifying with Clue 1:** \"solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"\n    *   We have A = Sulfur and C = SCl₂. The reaction requires chlorine gas, so **B = Cl₂**.\n    *   The stable form of solid sulfur at standard conditions is the crown-shaped octasulfur ring, **S₈**.\n    *   Let's write the balanced equation: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This equation shows that 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (Cl₂). This perfectly matches the stoichiometry given in the clue.\n\n*   **Verifying with Clue 4:** \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\n    *   We know B = Cl₂. So, a gas D reacts with Cl₂ in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent H.\n    *   A very common industrial reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This is a 1:1 reaction, and the product, 1,2-dichloroethane, is a widely used solvent.\n    *   This allows us to identify: **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene) and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane).\n\n*   **Verifying with Clue 2:** \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n    *   We have C = SCl₂ and D = C₂H₄.\n    *   The reaction is: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S`.\n    *   The product, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S, is commonly known as **Mustard Gas**, a chemical warfare agent that is extremely hazardous.\n    *   This confirms our identification: **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\nThe final task is to determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E, which is mustard gas.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent due to its two lone pairs of electrons.\n*   **Conformation:** The molecule is flexible due to rotation around the single bonds. We must consider its most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   The molecule is not linear (ruling out D∞h).\n    *   It does not have the high symmetry of a square planar molecule (ruling out D4h).\n    *   For the molecule to have C₂v symmetry, it would need a C₂ axis and two mirror planes. The presence of mirror planes would require the molecule to adopt a sterically unfavorable eclipsed conformation. In its staggered, low-energy state, it lacks mirror planes.\n    *   The most stable conformation of mustard gas possesses a single two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable from its original state.\n*   **Conclusion:** A molecule that possesses only an identity element (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying the unknown substances. There are two primary plausible interpretations of the clues, but one provides a more complete and elegant solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Clues and Identify Key Reactions**\n\n*   **Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    This hydrolysis reaction, which regenerates the starting solid `A`, is a powerful clue. It suggests a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Clue 1: `solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → bright red product C`**\n    The 1:8 stoichiometry is a very specific detail and likely crucial for solving the puzzle correctly.\n*   **Clue 4: `D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent)`**\n    This is a simple 1:1 addition reaction to form a solvent.\n*   **Clue 2: `C + 2 equivalents of gas D → extremely hazardous product E`**\n    This reaction forms the target molecule, E.\n\n**Step 2: Follow the Most Consistent Interpretation**\n\nThe most consistent interpretation hinges on solving the 1:8 stoichiometry in Clue 1.\n\n1.  Let's start with the hydrolysis in **Clue 3**. A well-known reaction that fits the description is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    This fits perfectly:\n    *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride)\n    *   **A = S** (Elemental sulfur, a solid)\n    *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid)\n    *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid, a weak acid formed when SO₂ dissolves in water)\n\n2.  Now, let's test this against **Clue 1**. We need to form `C` (SCl₂) from `A` (Sulfur) and a gas `B` with a 1:8 ratio.\n    *   The stable form of solid sulfur at standard conditions is the crown-shaped octasulfur ring, **S₈**.\n    *   The gas `B` must therefore be chlorine, **Cl₂**.\n    *   The balanced reaction is: **S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)**\n    *   This reaction shows that 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (Cl₂). This perfectly explains the stoichiometry. Additionally, sulfur dichloride (C) is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n\n3.  Next, we use **Clue 4** to identify `D` and `H`. We know `B` is Cl₂.\n    *   `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`\n    *   A common 1:1 addition reaction is the chlorination of ethene: **C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)**\n    *   The product, 1,2-dichloroethane, is a common solvent. This fits the clue perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene) and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane).\n\n4.  Finally, we use **Clue 2** to identify the hazardous product `E`.\n    *   `C (SCl₂) + 2D (C₂H₄) → E`\n    *   The reaction is: **SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing **bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide**, more commonly known as **Mustard Gas**. Mustard gas is an infamous chemical warfare agent and is extremely hazardous.\n    *   Thus, **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S (Mustard Gas)**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\nThe final task is to determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E, mustard gas.\n\n*   The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups, with a bent geometry at the sulfur atom.\n*   The molecule is not linear, ruling out **D∞h**.\n*   It does not have the high symmetry of a square planar molecule, ruling out **D4h**.\n*   For the molecule to have **C2v** symmetry, it would need to possess two mirror planes in addition to a C₂ axis. This would require the molecule to be planar, which is a high-energy, unstable conformation due to steric hindrance.\n*   The most stable, low-energy conformation of mustard gas possesses only one symmetry element (besides the identity element): a two-fold rotational axis (**C₂**) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n*   A molecule whose only symmetry element is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) D4h\nB) C2v\nC) D∞h\nD) C2\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is C₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances and ultimately determine the molecular symmetry of product E. The most logical approach is to find a single, consistent set of chemical identities that satisfies all the given clues.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Clues to Find the Most Consistent Chemical Pathway**\n\nThere are two main interpretations presented by the candidate answers, but one is significantly more consistent and chemically sound.\n\n*   **Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    This hydrolysis reaction is a powerful clue. The regeneration of solid A suggests it's an element, and the formation of two different acids points towards a disproportionation reaction. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) fits this perfectly:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    This allows us to hypothesize:\n    *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride). It is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   **A = S** (Sulfur), a solid element.\n    *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid), a strong acid.\n    *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid), a weak acid formed when `SO₂` dissolves in water.\n\n*   **Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    Let's test our hypothesis with this clue. The stable allotrope of solid sulfur (A) at standard conditions is the crown-shaped `S₈` ring. The gas B would be chlorine (`Cl₂`).\n    The balanced chemical equation is:\n    `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`\n    This reaction shows that 1 mole of solid A (`S₈`) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (`Cl₂`). This perfect stoichiometric match strongly supports our initial hypothesis.\n\n*   **Clue 4: `D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio**\n    We have identified B as chlorine (`Cl₂`). We need a gas D that reacts 1:1 with chlorine to form a solvent. A very common industrial reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethene:\n    `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    This fits perfectly:\n    *   **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene/Ethylene).\n    *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane), a widely used solvent.\n\n*   **Clue 2: `C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`**\n    Now we use our identified compounds to find E:\n    `C (SCl₂) + 2D (2C₂H₄) → E`\n    This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide:\n    `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`\n    The product, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`, is commonly known as **mustard gas**, a potent and infamous chemical warfare agent. This fits the description of an \"extremely hazardous product\" perfectly.\n    *   **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas)**\n\nThis pathway provides a consistent identity for every compound that fits every clue, including the specific stoichiometry.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E (Mustard Gas)**\n\nThe final task is to determine the point group (molecular symmetry group) for mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two 2-chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent due to its two lone pairs of electrons.\n2.  **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is not linear, so **D∞h** is incorrect.\n    *   The molecule does not have a square planar shape or the high degree of symmetry required for the **D4h** point group.\n    *   For the molecule to have **C₂v** symmetry, it would need a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes. This would require the molecule to be planar, which is a high-energy, sterically hindered conformation. Therefore, C₂v is incorrect for the stable structure.\n    *   The most stable, low-energy conformation of mustard gas possesses a single symmetry element (besides the identity element): a two-fold rotational axis (**C₂**) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable from its starting position.\n\nA molecule whose only symmetry element is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical puzzle consistently leads to the identification of E as mustard gas. The molecular symmetry group for mustard gas is C₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
