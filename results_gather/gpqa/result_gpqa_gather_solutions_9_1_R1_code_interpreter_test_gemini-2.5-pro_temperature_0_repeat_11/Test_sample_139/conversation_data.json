Let's examine some common simple gases (using the most common isotopes):\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons.\n    *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Match)\n    *   O₂: 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (Match)\n    *   CO: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Match)\n    *   HF: 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (Match)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Match)\n    The first clue mentions a \"heavier isotope,\" which makes D₂ a very strong candidate for gas W.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance B:** The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction:** Since heating G produces D₂O (B), G must be a compound that contains D₂O (like a deuterated hydrate) or can decompose to form it (like a metal deuteroxide). The overall reaction is:\n    X + Y (liquid) → W (gas) + G (precipitate)\n    If W is D₂ and the reaction involves D₂O, a plausible reaction is a strong reducing agent reacting with heavy water (D₂O). Let's assume Y is D₂O.\n    X + D₂O → D₂ + G\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   The clue \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\" points to X being a strong reducing agent. A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has at least three oxygen atoms. A reduction that produces a product with two oxygens would be the conversion of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to alcohol groups (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This is characteristic of strong reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   The clue \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" fits perfectly. LiAlH₄ is a powerful and common reagent, and its \"very close analog\" is Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), another extremely common reagent.\n    *   The first clue states X incorporates a \"heavier isotope.\" The deuterated version of LiAlH₄ is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**. This is a common reagent for introducing deuterium into molecules.\n\n5.  **Verify the entire reaction sequence with X = LiAlD₄:**\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄. It contains the heavier isotope Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Liquid Y:** D₂O (heavy water).\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is known to be violent, consistent with the clue.\n    *   **Gas W:** D₂. As determined in step 1, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide). This is the deuterated analog of Al(OH)₃, which is a precipitate. This fits.\n    *   **Heating G:** 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O.\n    *   **Substance B:** D₂O. Its melting point is ~277 K. This fits.\n    All clues are consistent with **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes.\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The mass numbers of the specific isotopes are: D = 2, Li = 7 (most common isotope), Al = 27 (only stable isotope).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as D, mass number 2).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (mass number 27).\n    *   The instruction states, \"...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we must account for all four deuterium atoms.\n    *   Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 atom × 27 = 27.\n    *   Total cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the information provided:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C), while the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). Given the clue about a heavier isotope, B is identified as **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released in a reaction and its molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's consider the reaction that produces B (D₂O). Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide. The violent reaction of X with liquid Y produces gas W and precipitate G. If the final products involve deuterium, it is highly likely that the reactants do as well. A plausible candidate for gas W is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify Liquid Y:** For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, the deuterated substance X must react with a deuterium source. This makes liquid Y **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is consistent with the identification of substance B.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** Substance X contains a heavy isotope, is a reagent in organic chemistry, and reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. A prime candidate for X is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is violent.\n    *   **Gas W:** D₂ is produced, which matches our earlier deduction.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, would form a precipitate.\n    *   **Heating G:** When heated, aluminum hydroxide (and by extension, deuteroxide) decomposes to form aluminum oxide and water (or in this case, D₂O, which is substance B).\n    *   **Organic Reagent:** LiAlD₄ and its common analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), are powerful and widely used reducing agents in organic chemistry.\n    *   **Reaction with Keto Acid:** A keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) when reduced by a strong agent like LiAlH₄ (or LiAlD₄) yields a diol (containing 2 oxygen atoms), which matches the description.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (present as 4 atoms of the Deuterium isotope).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (present as 1 atom).\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   We will use the mass numbers for this calculation, as the options are integers.\n    *   Mass number of Deuterium (D) is 2.\n    *   Mass number of Aluminum (Al) is 27.\n\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Deuterium):** 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Total Cumulative Mass:** 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Chemical Riddle:** I will analyze the clues provided to identify the unknown substances, particularly Substance X.\n    *   **Clue 1: Melting point of B.** The melting point of B is ~277 K, which is approximately 4°C. This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O). So, B is D₂O.\n    *   **Clue 2: Formation of B.** B (D₂O) is released when precipitate G is heated. This implies G is a deuterated hydrate or hydroxide, like a metal deuteroxide, which decomposes upon heating.\n    *   **Clue 3: The Reaction.** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. This is a classic pattern for a reactive metal hydride/deuteride reacting with water/heavy water.\n    *   **Clue 4: Gas W.** Gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. If the reaction involves deuterated compounds, a likely candidate for W is deuterium gas, D₂ (2 protons, 2 neutrons).\n    *   **Clue 5: Putting it together.** If X is a deuteride and it reacts with Y=D₂O, the reaction would be: `Metal-Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) -> Metal-Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`. This is consistent with all clues so far.\n    *   **Clue 6: Organic Chemistry Context.** X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its reaction with a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a strong reducing agent, capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol (which has 2 oxygens).\n    *   **Clue 7: Identifying X.** A very common strong reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits all the clues perfectly. It reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and precipitates of LiOD and Al(OD)₃. Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its heavier isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The problem asks for the cumulative atomic mass of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Mass of all Hydrogen atoms: There are 4 Deuterium (D) atoms. The mass of one D atom is ~2 amu. Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of all Aluminum atoms: There is 1 Aluminum (Al) atom. The mass of the stable isotope of Al is ~27 amu. Total mass = 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   The final sum is 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will define the counts and masses of the identified atoms and perform the final summation.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

We need a molecule with an equal number of protons (p) and neutrons (n).\n        *   H₂: 2p, 0n. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D has 1p and 1n. So D₂ has 2p and 2n. **This is a perfect match.**\n        *   CO₂: C(6p, 6n), O(8p, 8n). Total = 22p, 22n. **This is also a match.**\n        *   N₂O: N(7p, 7n), O(8p, 8n). Total = 22p, 22n. **This is also a match.**\n    *   However, the formation of D₂ gas strongly aligns with the \"heavier isotope\" clue. A violent reaction producing D₂ suggests a powerful deuteride reacting with a deuterium source.\n    *   The most common liquid deuterium source (Liquid Y) is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   So, we hypothesize: **X is a deuteride, Y is D₂O, and W is D₂.**\n\n*   **Clue 3:** \"...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   277 K is approximately 4 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is \"very close to 277 K\". So, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   G is a precipitate that releases D₂O upon heating. This means G is a deuterated hydroxide (a metal hydroxide containing D instead of H).\n    *   Let's test potential candidates for X (strong deuterides):\n        *   If X = NaBD₄ (Sodium borodeuteride): `NaBD₄ + 4 D₂O → NaB(OD)₄ + 4 D₂`. The product, sodium borate, is soluble. No precipitate G would form.\n        *   If X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium aluminum deuteride): `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4 D₂(g)`. Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate. This fits the description of G.\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause decomposition: `2 Al(OD)₃(s) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3 D₂O(g)`. This releases B (D₂O).\n    *   This confirms that **X = LiAlD₄**, **Y = D₂O**, **W = D₂**, **G = Al(OD)₃**, and **B = D₂O**.\n\n*   **Clue 4:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH).\n    *   X (LiAlD₄) is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   `R-CO-COOH + LiAlD₄ → (intermediate) → (after workup) → R-CD(OH)-CD₂OH`\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This clue is consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Clue 5:** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   X is LiAlD₄. Its \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄ (Lithium aluminum hydride), which is one of the most common and powerful reducing agents in synthetic organic chemistry. This strongly confirms our identification.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the required value.**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope, Deuterium, D).\n*   We identify the lightest and heaviest elements by their atomic number (number of protons).\n    *   Hydrogen (H/D): Atomic Number = 1  **(Lightest)**\n    *   Lithium (Li): Atomic Number = 3\n    *   Aluminum (Al): Atomic Number = 13 **(Heaviest)**\n*   The question specifies to sum the masses of all instances of these elements. We will use the mass number (protons + neutrons) for the calculation.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of Deuterium (D₄). The mass number of Deuterium (¹p + ¹n) is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum. The most stable and common isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** We sum the total masses from the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass from Hydrogen isotopes) + (Mass from Aluminum isotopes)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n**Step 3: Final Answer.**\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle to determine Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Identification\n\n1.  **Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is stated to be \"very close to 277 K\". The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K, which is approximately 3.82°C. This is remarkably close to 277 K, strongly suggesting that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0°C), which is not as close.\n\n2.  **Precipitate G**: Precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a deuterated hydroxide, which decomposes upon heating to form a metal oxide and heavy water. A plausible candidate for such a precipitate is aluminum hydroxide's deuterated analog, **Al(OD)₃**. Upon heating, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n\n3.  **Substance X and its Reaction**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W and precipitate G.\n    *   **Gas W**: The problem states that the molecules of gas W have an equal number of protons and neutrons. Deuterium gas (**D₂**) fits this description perfectly. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Substance X**: A reagent used in organic chemistry that contains a heavier isotope and reacts to form the products identified above is **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. It is a powerful reducing agent and a close analog of the very common Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Liquid Y**: For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, LiAlD₄ would need to react with a source of deuterium, making **heavy water (D₂O)** the logical identity for liquid Y.\n    *   **The Reaction**: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4D₂ (gas W). This reaction is known to be violent, similar to the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water.\n\n4.  **Confirmation with Keto Acid Reaction**: The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, totaling 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (-CD₂(OH)). The resulting product, a diol, would contain 2 oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the clue.\n\n### Calculation\n\nHaving confidently identified Substance X as **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, we can proceed with the calculation.\n\n1.  **Elements in Substance X**: The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its heavier isotope, Deuterium, D).\n\n2.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**:\n    *   Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Z=13).\n\n3.  **Sum of Atomic Masses**: The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule, summing all isotopes of each. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation as implied by the answer choices.\n    *   **Mass of the Lightest Element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms of the Deuterium (²H) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass of the Heaviest Element (Aluminum)**: There is one atom of Aluminum. The most common and stable isotope is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n\n4.  **Cumulative Sum**:\n    *   Sum = (Mass of all Deuterium atoms) + (Mass of all Aluminum atoms)\n    *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses.\n\n### Identification of the Substances\n\n1.  **Substance B**: The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K. This is approximately 3.85°C or 38.9°F. This value is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O).\n\n2.  **Substance X and its Isotope**: The presence of heavy water (D₂O) as a product strongly suggests that the heavier isotope in Substance X is deuterium (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n3.  **Organic Chemistry Context**: The problem states that Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. It also mentions that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group. A powerful reducing agent would reduce both groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of Substance X.\n\n4.  **Reaction with Liquid Y**: LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic solvents like water. Let's test the reaction with heavy water (D₂O) as Liquid Y.\n    *   **Reaction**: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n    *   **Gas W**: The gas released is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium molecule (D₂) consists of two deuterons, each having 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, the molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the description that the number of protons and neutrons are equal.\n    *   **Precipitate G**: The products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). While LiOD is soluble, Al(OD)₃ is insoluble and would form a precipitate.\n    *   **Heating G**: When aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) is heated, it decomposes to aluminium oxide and water. Similarly, heating aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) would release heavy water (B, D₂O).\n\nAll clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄). The phrasing \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" is a key instruction.\n\n1.  **Elements in LiAlD₄**: The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n\n2.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**:\n    *   Based on atomic number and mass, Hydrogen is the lightest element, and Aluminium is the heaviest element.\n\n3.  **Summing the Masses**:\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms of the lightest element, all of which are the deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of deuterium is 2. Therefore, the total mass contributed by the lightest element is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium)**: There is one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminium (Al). The mass number of the most common isotope of aluminium is 27.\n\n4.  **Cumulative Mass**: The cumulative mass is the sum of the total masses of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass of Hydrogen isotopes) + (Total mass of Aluminium isotopes)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThus, the cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the clues provided:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is close to 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This strongly suggests that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G:** Precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a deuterated hydroxide. Given the subsequent reactions, **G is aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**. Heating Al(OD)₃ causes it to decompose into aluminum oxide and heavy water (2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O).\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) and a gas W. The clue that \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common reducing agents. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful and widely used reducing agent. Its close analog containing a heavier isotope of hydrogen would be **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits the description of substance X.\n\n4.  **Identify Gas W and Confirm the Reaction:** If X is LiAlD₄, it would react with a deuterated solvent to produce the precipitate Al(OD)₃. Let's assume liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O). The reaction would be:\n    LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n\n    Now, let's check if gas W (D₂) fits the description \"its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   A deuterium (D) atom contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A D₂ molecule, therefore, contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    This matches the description perfectly. Thus, the identified substances and the reaction are consistent with all the clues.\n\n5.  **Verify the Keto Acid Reaction:** The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. A keto acid contains both a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. The reduction of both of these functional groups would result in a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains two oxygen atoms. This confirms the identity of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n    *   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1). In LiAlD₄, it is present as 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13). In LiAlD₄, it is present as 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the stable isotope of aluminum is 27.\n    *   **Intermediate Element:** Lithium (Atomic Number 3). The most common isotope has a mass number of 7.\n\n    The question asks for the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n\n    *   **Total mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium):** There are 4 deuterium atoms. Mass = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 aluminum atom. Mass = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n    **Cumulative Atomic Mass** = (Total mass of Deuterium) + (Total mass of Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is very close to the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   Therefore, substance B is D₂O.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G and Gas W:**\n    *   Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a compound that contains deuterium and oxygen and decomposes upon heating to release D₂O. A metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, is a likely candidate, as it would decompose to a metal oxide and D₂O (e.g., Ca(OD)₂ → CaO + D₂O).\n    *   Gas W is released during the reaction and its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple molecules:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely in this context)\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely)\n    *   Given that D₂O is involved, the most plausible identity for gas W is D₂.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Substances X and Y:**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ).\n    *   The reaction produces both D₂ and M(OD)ₓ. To form D₂, the reactants must supply deuterium. To form the deuteroxide, the reactants must supply the metal (M), oxygen (O), and deuterium (D).\n    *   The problem states that X incorporates a \"heavier isotope,\" which we've identified as deuterium (D). So, X must be a deuterated compound.\n    *   Let's propose a general reaction: A deuteride (from X) reacts with an oxygen source (Y). If the gas produced is D₂, a plausible reaction is the reaction of a deuteride with D₂O.\n    *   Let X be a metal deuteride and Y be D₂O. The reaction would be: `Metal Deuteride + D₂O → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`.\n    *   This reaction type is known for being violent, especially with reactive metal hydrides/deuterides.\n\n4.  **Use the Organic Chemistry Clues to Pinpoint X:**\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards a common reagent.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid has the general formula R-C(=O)-COOH, which contains 3 oxygen atoms. The reaction with X reduces the number of oxygen atoms to 2. This means X is a reducing agent.\n    *   Common hydride reducing agents in organic chemistry include sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄. LiAlH₄ is an \"especially\" common and powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n        *   **Analog:** LiAlH₄ is a very common reagent. This fits perfectly.\n        *   **Reaction with Y=D₂O:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n        *   **Violent?** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent.\n        *   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂ gas. This fits.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** The reaction produces LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (aluminium deuteroxide), which is a gelatinous precipitate analogous to Al(OH)₃. This fits.\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause decomposition: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases D₂O (Substance B). This fits.\n        *   **Reaction with keto acid:** LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group of a keto acid (R-C(=O)-COOH) to alcohols, forming a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). The starting keto acid has 3 oxygen atoms, and the final diol product has 2 oxygen atoms. This fits perfectly.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues point to Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄. The elements are Li, Al, and D (Deuterium, ²H).\n    *   We need the atomic masses (we can use integer mass numbers as the answers are integers):\n        *   Mass of Deuterium (D): 2\n        *   Mass of Lithium (Li): 7 (using the most common isotope, ⁷Li)\n        *   Mass of Aluminium (Al): 27 (only one stable isotope, ²⁷Al)\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (D), with a mass of 2.\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (Al), with a mass of 27.\n    *   The phrase \"cumulative atomic masses\" and the instruction \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" means we must sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in the formula.\n    *   Mass of all lightest element atoms (D): There are 4 D atoms in LiAlD₄. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of all heaviest element atoms (Al): There is 1 Al atom in LiAlD₄. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative sum = (Mass of all D atoms) + (Mass of all Al atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance B:**\n    *   The problem states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is the well-known melting point of heavy water, or deuterium oxide (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   The initial clue mentions that Substance X incorporates a \"heavier isotope,\" which strongly supports the presence of deuterium (D), the heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Gas W:**\n    *   The problem states that gas W is released in a reaction and its molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   Let's examine some simple gas molecules:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.

The molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. (Yes)\n    *   Given that we've already identified D₂O in the problem, the most logical candidate for gas W is **D₂**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n    *   **Clue 1:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope.\" This fits with a deuterated compound.\n    *   **Clue 2:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. A reduction reaction is required to lower the oxygen count to 2 (by converting both the ketone and carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). This means **X is a strong reducing agent**.\n    *   **Clue 3:** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common pair of reagents where one is the deuterated version of the other. The most famous strong reducing agent pairs are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Clue 4:** X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W (D₂) and form precipitate G. Let's test the hypothesis that **X is LiAlD₄**.\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent, fitting Clue 2.\n        *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent, fitting Clue 3.\n        *   It contains deuterium, fitting Clue 1.\n        *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with a deuterium source like heavy water (Y = D₂O) would be violent and produce D₂ gas. The reaction is:\n            LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)\n        *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W), which matches our deduction.\n        *   It also produces Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate, matching the description of G.\n    *   **Clue 5:** \"precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"\n        *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) causes decomposition:\n            2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O (B)\n        *   This reaction releases D₂O (B), which perfectly matches our first deduction.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The formula for Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   We identify the lightest and heaviest elements by their atomic number (Z):\n        *   Hydrogen (Z=1) -> **Lightest element**\n        *   Lithium (Z=3)\n        *   Aluminum (Z=13) -> **Heaviest element**\n    *   The question specifies to sum the masses of *all* instances of these elements in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved:\n        *   The isotope of the lightest element (Hydrogen) is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**.\n        *   The isotope of the heaviest element (Aluminum) is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**.\n    *   Now, we calculate the cumulative mass:\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (H): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Al): There is 1 atom of Aluminum. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from H) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a multi-step chemical puzzle. Let's break down the clues systematically to identify the unknown substances and arrive at the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The most specific clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   To convert Kelvin to Celsius, we use the formula: °C = K - 273.15.\n    *   277 K is approximately 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The problem states that gas W's molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Since we know Deuterium is involved, let's examine Deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A single Deuterium atom (symbol D or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A molecule of Deuterium gas (D₂) therefore contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   The number of protons equals the number of neutrons, so **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Identify X, Y, and G:**\n    *   The overall reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → Precipitate G + Gas W (D₂).\n    *   We are told the reaction is \"violent\".\n    *   We also know that precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is a characteristic decomposition of a metal deuteroxide, which breaks down into a metal oxide and heavy water. So, **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n    *   For the reaction to produce a metal deuteroxide (G) and deuterium gas (D₂), substance X must be a metal deuteride, and liquid Y must be D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is: X (Metal Deuteride) + Y (D₂O) → G (Metal Deuteroxide) + W (D₂).\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** We have two final, crucial clues about X:\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This strongly suggests a common hydride reducing agent. The most well-known are Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs, NaBD₄ and **LiAlD₄**, fit the description perfectly.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid contains two oxygen-bearing functional groups: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH). LiAlH₄ (and by extension, LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both of these groups to alcohols (-OH). The resulting product, a diol, would have exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms that X is a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄. (NaBD₄ is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids).\n\n    Therefore, we can confidently identify **Substance X as LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄). We will use the integer mass numbers for the relevant isotopes.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its most common isotope is 27.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (D):** There are four atoms of the isotope Deuterium. The mass number of Deuterium is 2. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** (Mass of Al) + (Total mass of D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Substance B**\n\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\nThis temperature is very close to the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\nThis, combined with the initial clue that Substance X contains a \"heavier isotope,\" strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n**2. Identify Precipitate G and the Reaction that Forms B**\n\nSubstance G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of the thermal decomposition of a metal hydroxide (or in this case, a metal deuteroxide). For example, a metal hydroxide decomposes into a metal oxide and water upon heating:\nM(OH)ₓ --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + H₂O\nTherefore, G must be a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes as follows:\nM(OD)ₓ --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + D₂O (Substance B)\n\n**3. Identify Gas W**\n\nGas W is released during the reaction of X and Y. The key property of W is that its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple gases:\n*   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. **(Protons = Neutrons)**. This is a strong candidate, especially since we've already identified D₂O in the reaction pathway.\n*   **¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas):** A ¹⁴N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. An N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. **(Protons = Neutrons)**. This is a possibility.\n*   **¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide):** A ¹²C atom has 6p, 6n. A ¹⁶O atom has 8p, 8n. A CO molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. **(Protons = Neutrons)**. This is also a possibility.\n*   **HD (Hydrogen deuteride):** 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p ≠ n).\n\nGiven that deuterium is clearly involved in the reaction (forming D₂O), D₂ is the most likely candidate for gas W.\n\n**4. Identify Substance X**\n\nWe have several clues about X:\n*   It contains a heavy isotope (Deuterium).\n*   It's a reagent used in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is especially common.\n*   It reacts with a liquid Y to produce a gas W (likely D₂), and a precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide).\n*   The product of its reaction with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. A reaction that reduces it to a product with 2 oxygens would be the reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to form a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which has 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a powerful reducing agent.\n\nA very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its analog containing a heavy isotope is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Let's see if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues.\n\n**5. Verify the Reaction Chemistry with X = LiAlD₄**\n\nLet's assume X is LiAlD₄. It is known to react violently with water. If liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction would be:\nLiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n\nLet's check the products against our deductions:\n*   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂ gas. As established, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (p=n). This fits.\n*   **Precipitate G:** The reaction produces Lithium Deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble in D₂O, and Aluminum Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Aluminum hydroxide is a well-known precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would be the precipitate G. This fits.\n*   **Heating G:** As determined earlier, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would produce an oxide and B (D₂O). This fits.\n*   **Organic Reagent:** LiAlH₄ is a staple in organic synthesis, and LiAlD₄ is its common deuterated analog. This fits.\n*   **Keto Acid Reaction:** LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is strong enough to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols, turning a keto acid into a diol, which has two oxygen atoms. This fits.\n\nAll clues point consistently to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The phrasing \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" indicates we need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Lightest Element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number):** Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   We will use integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes in the molecule: D (²H) has a mass of 2. The most common isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, with a mass of 27.\n\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D).\n    Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al).\n    Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K.\n2.  **Identify Substance G**: Precipitate G releases substance B (D₂O) upon heating. This indicates that G is a deuterated hydrate (a compound containing D₂O in its structure).\n3.  **Identify Gas W**: The gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. A simple molecule that fits this description is deuterium gas (D₂). Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n4.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G. The problem states that X contains a heavier isotope (which we know is deuterium, D) and that it and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of substance X perfectly. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water. For the reaction to produce deuterium gas (D₂), the other reactant must also be a source of deuterium. Therefore, liquid Y must be **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n5.  **Confirm the Reaction**: The reaction between Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (X) and heavy water (Y) is:\n    LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    This reaction produces deuterium gas (W) and aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a precipitate (G). Heating Al(OD)₃ yields aluminum oxide and heavy water (B). This confirms the identities of all substances.\n6.  **Confirm the Final Clue**: The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid into alcohol groups. The resulting product is a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. This final clue is consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n7.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass**: The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The molecule contains four atoms of the lightest element, in the form of Deuterium (²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu. The total mass from the lightest element is 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   The molecule contains one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminium. Aluminium's only stable isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass of approximately 27 amu. The total mass from the heaviest element is 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   The cumulative mass is the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided clues, the substances involved have been identified as follows:\n\n*   **Substance X**: Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). This is deduced from its nature as a powerful reducing agent (a close analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent in organic chemistry), its reaction to form the other identified products, and its role in the reduction of a keto acid. The reaction of a keto acid (containing a ketone and a carboxylic acid) with a strong reducing agent like LiAlH₄ (or its deuterated analog LiAlD₄) reduces both functional groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol which contains two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Liquid Y**: Heavy Water (D₂O). Its reaction with a deuteride source like LiAlD₄ is violent and produces the identified gas and precipitate.\n*   **Gas W**: Deuterium gas (D₂).

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Clues and Identification of Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B:** The clue states its melting point is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is an excellent match, especially given the clue about a \"heavier isotope\".\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The clue states its molecule has an \"equal number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Since we've identified the involvement of deuterium (D), the heavy isotope of hydrogen, let's examine deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Precipitate G:** G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of the thermal decomposition of a metal deuteroxide, which breaks down into a metal oxide and heavy water.\n    *   `M(OD)ₓ --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + D₂O`\n    *   Therefore, **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n\n*   **Substance X:** This is the central unknown.\n    *   **Clue A:** It contains a heavier isotope (which we know is Deuterium).\n    *   **Clue B:** It reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide). This points to X being a metal deuteride and Y being heavy water (D₂O). The reaction is `Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`.\n    *   **Clue C:** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common reducing agent. The pair Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, are a perfect fit.\n    *   **Clue D:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. A strong reducing agent like LiAlH₄ (or LiAlD₄) reduces both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which has 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms X is a strong reducing agent.\n    *   **Confirmation:** If X is LiAlD₄, the reaction with Y (D₂O) is `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. This produces a precipitate, Aluminum Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), which is G. This is consistent with all clues.\n\n**2. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number):** Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the molecule, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n    *   Mass number of Deuterium (D) = 2.\n    *   Mass number of Aluminum (Al) = 27.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Aluminum. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.**\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option A.

Let's examine some common simple gases (using the most common isotopes):\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons.\n    *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Match)\n    *   O₂: 16 protons, 16 neutrons.

(Match)\n    The first clue mentions a \"heavier isotope,\" which makes D₂ a very strong candidate for gas W.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance B:** The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction:** Since heating G produces D₂O (B), G must be a compound that contains D₂O (like a deuterated hydrate) or can decompose to form it (like a metal deuteroxide). The overall reaction is:\n    X + Y (liquid) → W (gas) + G (precipitate)\n    If W is D₂ and the reaction involves D₂O, a plausible reaction is a strong reducing agent reacting with heavy water (D₂O). Let's assume Y is D₂O.\n    X + D₂O → D₂ + G\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   The clue \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\" points to X being a strong reducing agent. A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has at least three oxygen atoms. A reduction that produces a product with two oxygens would be the conversion of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to alcohol groups (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This is characteristic of strong reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   The clue \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" fits perfectly. LiAlH₄ is a powerful and common reagent, and its \"very close analog\" is Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), another extremely common reagent.\n    *   The first clue states X incorporates a \"heavier isotope.\" The deuterated version of LiAlH₄ is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**. This is a common reagent for introducing deuterium into molecules.\n\n5.  **Verify the entire reaction sequence with X = LiAlD₄:**\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄. It contains the heavier isotope Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Liquid Y:** D₂O (heavy water).\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is known to be violent, consistent with the clue.\n    *   **Gas W:** D₂. As determined in step 1, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide). This is the deuterated analog of Al(OH)₃, which is a precipitate. This fits.\n    *   **Heating G:** 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O.\n    *   **Substance B:** D₂O. Its melting point is ~277 K. This fits.\n    All clues are consistent with **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".

The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C), while the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). Given the clue about a heavier isotope, B is identified as **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released in a reaction and its molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's consider the reaction that produces B (D₂O). Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide. The violent reaction of X with liquid Y produces gas W and precipitate G. If the final products involve deuterium, it is highly likely that the reactants do as well. A plausible candidate for gas W is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify Liquid Y:** For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, the deuterated substance X must react with a deuterium source. This makes liquid Y **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is consistent with the identification of substance B.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** Substance X contains a heavy isotope, is a reagent in organic chemistry, and reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. A prime candidate for X is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is violent.\n    *   **Gas W:** D₂ is produced, which matches our earlier deduction.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, would form a precipitate.\n    *   **Heating G:** When heated, aluminum hydroxide (and by extension, deuteroxide) decomposes to form aluminum oxide and water (or in this case, D₂O, which is substance B).\n    *   **Organic Reagent:** LiAlD₄ and its common analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), are powerful and widely used reducing agents in organic chemistry.\n    *   **Reaction with Keto Acid:** A keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) when reduced by a strong agent like LiAlH₄ (or LiAlD₄) yields a diol (containing 2 oxygen atoms), which matches the description.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (present as 4 atoms of the Deuterium isotope).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (present as 1 atom).\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   We will use the mass numbers for this calculation, as the options are integers.\n    *   Mass number of Deuterium (D) is 2.\n    *   Mass number of Aluminum (Al) is 27.\n\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Deuterium):** 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Total Cumulative Mass:** 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Chemical Riddle:** I will analyze the clues provided to identify the unknown substances, particularly Substance X.\n    *   **Clue 1: Melting point of B.** The melting point of B is ~277 K, which is approximately 4°C. This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O). So, B is D₂O.\n    *   **Clue 2: Formation of B.** B (D₂O) is released when precipitate G is heated. This implies G is a deuterated hydrate or hydroxide, like a metal deuteroxide, which decomposes upon heating.\n    *   **Clue 3: The Reaction.** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. This is a classic pattern for a reactive metal hydride/deuteride reacting with water/heavy water.\n    *   **Clue 4: Gas W.** Gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. If the reaction involves deuterated compounds, a likely candidate for W is deuterium gas, D₂ (2 protons, 2 neutrons).\n    *   **Clue 5: Putting it together.** If X is a deuteride and it reacts with Y=D₂O, the reaction would be: `Metal-Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) -> Metal-Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`. This is consistent with all clues so far.\n    *   **Clue 6: Organic Chemistry Context.** X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its reaction with a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a strong reducing agent, capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol (which has 2 oxygens).\n    *   **Clue 7: Identifying X.** A very common strong reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits all the clues perfectly. It reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and precipitates of LiOD and Al(OD)₃. Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its heavier isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The problem asks for the cumulative atomic mass of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Mass of all Hydrogen atoms: There are 4 Deuterium (D) atoms. The mass of one D atom is ~2 amu. Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of all Aluminum atoms: There is 1 Aluminum (Al) atom. The mass of the stable isotope of Al is ~27 amu. Total mass = 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   The final sum is 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will define the counts and masses of the identified atoms and perform the final summation.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

We need a molecule with an equal number of protons (p) and neutrons (n).\n        *   H₂: 2p, 0n. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D has 1p and 1n. So D₂ has 2p and 2n. **This is a perfect match.**\n        *   CO₂: C(6p, 6n), O(8p, 8n). Total = 22p, 22n. **This is also a match.**\n        *   N₂O: N(7p, 7n), O(8p, 8n). Total = 22p, 22n. **This is also a match.**\n    *   However, the formation of D₂ gas strongly aligns with the \"heavier isotope\" clue. A violent reaction producing D₂ suggests a powerful deuteride reacting with a deuterium source.\n    *   The most common liquid deuterium source (Liquid Y) is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   So, we hypothesize: **X is a deuteride, Y is D₂O, and W is D₂.**\n\n*   **Clue 3:** \"...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   277 K is approximately 4 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is \"very close to 277 K\". So, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   G is a precipitate that releases D₂O upon heating. This means G is a deuterated hydroxide (a metal hydroxide containing D instead of H).\n    *   Let's test potential candidates for X (strong deuterides):\n        *   If X = NaBD₄ (Sodium borodeuteride): `NaBD₄ + 4 D₂O → NaB(OD)₄ + 4 D₂`. The product, sodium borate, is soluble. No precipitate G would form.\n        *   If X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium aluminum deuteride): `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4 D₂(g)`. Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate. This fits the description of G.\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause decomposition: `2 Al(OD)₃(s) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3 D₂O(g)`. This releases B (D₂O).\n    *   This confirms that **X = LiAlD₄**, **Y = D₂O**, **W = D₂**, **G = Al(OD)₃**, and **B = D₂O**.\n\n*   **Clue 4:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH).\n    *   X (LiAlD₄) is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   `R-CO-COOH + LiAlD₄ → (intermediate) → (after workup) → R-CD(OH)-CD₂OH`\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This clue is consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Clue 5:** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   X is LiAlD₄. Its \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄ (Lithium aluminum hydride), which is one of the most common and powerful reducing agents in synthetic organic chemistry.

The most stable and common isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** We sum the total masses from the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass from Hydrogen isotopes) + (Mass from Aluminum isotopes)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n**Step 3: Final Answer.**\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle to determine Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Identification\n\n1.  **Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is stated to be \"very close to 277 K\". The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K, which is approximately 3.82°C. This is remarkably close to 277 K, strongly suggesting that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0°C), which is not as close.\n\n2.  **Precipitate G**: Precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a deuterated hydroxide, which decomposes upon heating to form a metal oxide and heavy water. A plausible candidate for such a precipitate is aluminum hydroxide's deuterated analog, **Al(OD)₃**. Upon heating, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n\n3.  **Substance X and its Reaction**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W and precipitate G.\n    *   **Gas W**: The problem states that the molecules of gas W have an equal number of protons and neutrons. Deuterium gas (**D₂**) fits this description perfectly. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Substance X**: A reagent used in organic chemistry that contains a heavier isotope and reacts to form the products identified above is **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. It is a powerful reducing agent and a close analog of the very common Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Liquid Y**: For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, LiAlD₄ would need to react with a source of deuterium, making **heavy water (D₂O)** the logical identity for liquid Y.\n    *   **The Reaction**: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4D₂ (gas W). This reaction is known to be violent, similar to the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water.\n\n4.  **Confirmation with Keto Acid Reaction**: The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, totaling 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (-CD₂(OH)). The resulting product, a diol, would contain 2 oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the clue.\n\n### Calculation\n\nHaving confidently identified Substance X as **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, we can proceed with the calculation.\n\n1.  **Elements in Substance X**: The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its heavier isotope, Deuterium, D).\n\n2.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**:\n    *   Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Z=13).\n\n3.  **Sum of Atomic Masses**: The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule, summing all isotopes of each. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation as implied by the answer choices.\n    *   **Mass of the Lightest Element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms of the Deuterium (²H) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass of the Heaviest Element (Aluminum)**: There is one atom of Aluminum. The most common and stable isotope is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n\n4.  **Cumulative Sum**:\n    *   Sum = (Mass of all Deuterium atoms) + (Mass of all Aluminum atoms)\n    *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses.\n\n### Identification of the Substances\n\n1.  **Substance B**: The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K. This is approximately 3.85°C or 38.9°F. This value is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O).\n\n2.  **Substance X and its Isotope**: The presence of heavy water (D₂O) as a product strongly suggests that the heavier isotope in Substance X is deuterium (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n3.  **Organic Chemistry Context**: The problem states that Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. It also mentions that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group. A powerful reducing agent would reduce both groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of Substance X.\n\n4.  **Reaction with Liquid Y**: LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic solvents like water. Let's test the reaction with heavy water (D₂O) as Liquid Y.\n    *   **Reaction**: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n    *   **Gas W**: The gas released is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium molecule (D₂) consists of two deuterons, each having 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, the molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the description that the number of protons and neutrons are equal.\n    *   **Precipitate G**: The products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). While LiOD is soluble, Al(OD)₃ is insoluble and would form a precipitate.\n    *   **Heating G**: When aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) is heated, it decomposes to aluminium oxide and water. Similarly, heating aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) would release heavy water (B, D₂O).\n\nAll clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄). The phrasing \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" is a key instruction.\n\n1.  **Elements in LiAlD₄**: The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n\n2.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**:\n    *   Based on atomic number and mass, Hydrogen is the lightest element, and Aluminium is the heaviest element.\n\n3.  **Summing the Masses**:\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms of the lightest element, all of which are the deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of deuterium is 2. Therefore, the total mass contributed by the lightest element is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium)**: There is one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminium (Al). The mass number of the most common isotope of aluminium is 27.\n\n4.  **Cumulative Mass**: The cumulative mass is the sum of the total masses of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass of Hydrogen isotopes) + (Total mass of Aluminium isotopes)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThus, the cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the clues provided:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is close to 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This strongly suggests that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G:** Precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a deuterated hydroxide. Given the subsequent reactions, **G is aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**. Heating Al(OD)₃ causes it to decompose into aluminum oxide and heavy water (2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O).\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) and a gas W. The clue that \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common reducing agents. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful and widely used reducing agent. Its close analog containing a heavier isotope of hydrogen would be **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits the description of substance X.\n\n4.  **Identify Gas W and Confirm the Reaction:** If X is LiAlD₄, it would react with a deuterated solvent to produce the precipitate Al(OD)₃. Let's assume liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O). The reaction would be:\n    LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n\n    Now, let's check if gas W (D₂) fits the description \"its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   A deuterium (D) atom contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A D₂ molecule, therefore, contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    This matches the description perfectly. Thus, the identified substances and the reaction are consistent with all the clues.\n\n5.  **Verify the Keto Acid Reaction:** The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. A keto acid contains both a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. The reduction of both of these functional groups would result in a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains two oxygen atoms. This confirms the identity of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n    *   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1). In LiAlD₄, it is present as 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13). In LiAlD₄, it is present as 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the stable isotope of aluminum is 27.\n    *   **Intermediate Element:** Lithium (Atomic Number 3). The most common isotope has a mass number of 7.\n\n    The question asks for the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n\n    *   **Total mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium):** There are 4 deuterium atoms. Mass = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 aluminum atom. Mass = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n    **Cumulative Atomic Mass** = (Total mass of Deuterium) + (Total mass of Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is very close to the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   Therefore, substance B is D₂O.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G and Gas W:**\n    *   Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a compound that contains deuterium and oxygen and decomposes upon heating to release D₂O. A metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, is a likely candidate, as it would decompose to a metal oxide and D₂O (e.g., Ca(OD)₂ → CaO + D₂O).\n    *   Gas W is released during the reaction and its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple molecules:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely in this context)\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely)\n    *   Given that D₂O is involved, the most plausible identity for gas W is D₂.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Substances X and Y:**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ).\n    *   The reaction produces both D₂ and M(OD)ₓ. To form D₂, the reactants must supply deuterium. To form the deuteroxide, the reactants must supply the metal (M), oxygen (O), and deuterium (D).\n    *   The problem states that X incorporates a \"heavier isotope,\" which we've identified as deuterium (D). So, X must be a deuterated compound.\n    *   Let's propose a general reaction: A deuteride (from X) reacts with an oxygen source (Y). If the gas produced is D₂, a plausible reaction is the reaction of a deuteride with D₂O.\n    *   Let X be a metal deuteride and Y be D₂O. The reaction would be: `Metal Deuteride + D₂O → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`.\n    *   This reaction type is known for being violent, especially with reactive metal hydrides/deuterides.\n\n4.  **Use the Organic Chemistry Clues to Pinpoint X:**\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards a common reagent.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid has the general formula R-C(=O)-COOH, which contains 3 oxygen atoms. The reaction with X reduces the number of oxygen atoms to 2. This means X is a reducing agent.\n    *   Common hydride reducing agents in organic chemistry include sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄. LiAlH₄ is an \"especially\" common and powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n        *   **Analog:** LiAlH₄ is a very common reagent. This fits perfectly.\n        *   **Reaction with Y=D₂O:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n        *   **Violent?** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent.\n        *   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂ gas. This fits.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** The reaction produces LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (aluminium deuteroxide), which is a gelatinous precipitate analogous to Al(OH)₃. This fits.\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause decomposition: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases D₂O (Substance B). This fits.\n        *   **Reaction with keto acid:** LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group of a keto acid (R-C(=O)-COOH) to alcohols, forming a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). The starting keto acid has 3 oxygen atoms, and the final diol product has 2 oxygen atoms. This fits perfectly.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues point to Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.

Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of all heaviest element atoms (Al): There is 1 Al atom in LiAlD₄. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative sum = (Mass of all D atoms) + (Mass of all Al atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance B:**\n    *   The problem states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is the well-known melting point of heavy water, or deuterium oxide (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   The initial clue mentions that Substance X incorporates a \"heavier isotope,\" which strongly supports the presence of deuterium (D), the heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Gas W:**\n    *   The problem states that gas W is released in a reaction and its molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   Let's examine some simple gas molecules:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.

A reduction reaction is required to lower the oxygen count to 2 (by converting both the ketone and carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). This means **X is a strong reducing agent**.\n    *   **Clue 3:** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common pair of reagents where one is the deuterated version of the other. The most famous strong reducing agent pairs are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Clue 4:** X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W (D₂) and form precipitate G.

Let's break down the clues systematically to identify the unknown substances and arrive at the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The most specific clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   To convert Kelvin to Celsius, we use the formula: °C = K - 273.15.\n    *   277 K is approximately 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The problem states that gas W's molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Since we know Deuterium is involved, let's examine Deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A single Deuterium atom (symbol D or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A molecule of Deuterium gas (D₂) therefore contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   The number of protons equals the number of neutrons, so **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Identify X, Y, and G:**\n    *   The overall reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → Precipitate G + Gas W (D₂).\n    *   We are told the reaction is \"violent\".\n    *   We also know that precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is a characteristic decomposition of a metal deuteroxide, which breaks down into a metal oxide and heavy water. So, **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n    *   For the reaction to produce a metal deuteroxide (G) and deuterium gas (D₂), substance X must be a metal deuteride, and liquid Y must be D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is: X (Metal Deuteride) + Y (D₂O) → G (Metal Deuteroxide) + W (D₂).\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** We have two final, crucial clues about X:\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This strongly suggests a common hydride reducing agent. The most well-known are Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs, NaBD₄ and **LiAlD₄**, fit the description perfectly.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid contains two oxygen-bearing functional groups: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH). LiAlH₄ (and by extension, LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both of these groups to alcohols (-OH). The resulting product, a diol, would have exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms that X is a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄. (NaBD₄ is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids).\n\n    Therefore, we can confidently identify **Substance X as LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄). We will use the integer mass numbers for the relevant isotopes.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its most common isotope is 27.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (D):** There are four atoms of the isotope Deuterium. The mass number of Deuterium is 2. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** (Mass of Al) + (Total mass of D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Substance B**\n\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\nThis temperature is very close to the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\nThis, combined with the initial clue that Substance X contains a \"heavier isotope,\" strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n**2. Identify Precipitate G and the Reaction that Forms B**\n\nSubstance G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of the thermal decomposition of a metal hydroxide (or in this case, a metal deuteroxide). For example, a metal hydroxide decomposes into a metal oxide and water upon heating:\nM(OH)ₓ --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + H₂O\nTherefore, G must be a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes as follows:\nM(OD)ₓ --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + D₂O (Substance B)\n\n**3. Identify Gas W**\n\nGas W is released during the reaction of X and Y. The key property of W is that its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple gases:\n*   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. **(Protons = Neutrons)**. This is a strong candidate, especially since we've already identified D₂O in the reaction pathway.\n*   **¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas):** A ¹⁴N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. An N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. **(Protons = Neutrons)**. This is a possibility.\n*   **¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide):** A ¹²C atom has 6p, 6n. A ¹⁶O atom has 8p, 8n. A CO molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. **(Protons = Neutrons)**. This is also a possibility.\n*   **HD (Hydrogen deuteride):** 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p ≠ n).\n\nGiven that deuterium is clearly involved in the reaction (forming D₂O), D₂ is the most likely candidate for gas W.\n\n**4. Identify Substance X**\n\nWe have several clues about X:\n*   It contains a heavy isotope (Deuterium).\n*   It's a reagent used in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is especially common.\n*   It reacts with a liquid Y to produce a gas W (likely D₂), and a precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide).\n*   The product of its reaction with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. A reaction that reduces it to a product with 2 oxygens would be the reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to form a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which has 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a powerful reducing agent.\n\nA very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its analog containing a heavy isotope is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Let's see if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues.\n\n**5. Verify the Reaction Chemistry with X = LiAlD₄**\n\nLet's assume X is LiAlD₄. It is known to react violently with water. If liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction would be:\nLiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n\nLet's check the products against our deductions:\n*   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂ gas. As established, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (p=n). This fits.\n*   **Precipitate G:** The reaction produces Lithium Deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble in D₂O, and Aluminum Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Aluminum hydroxide is a well-known precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would be the precipitate G. This fits.\n*   **Heating G:** As determined earlier, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would produce an oxide and B (D₂O). This fits.\n*   **Organic Reagent:** LiAlH₄ is a staple in organic synthesis, and LiAlD₄ is its common deuterated analog. This fits.\n*   **Keto Acid Reaction:** LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is strong enough to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols, turning a keto acid into a diol, which has two oxygen atoms. This fits.\n\nAll clues point consistently to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The phrasing \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" indicates we need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Lightest Element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number):** Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   We will use integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes in the molecule: D (²H) has a mass of 2. The most common isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, with a mass of 27.\n\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D).\n    Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al).\n    Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K.\n2.  **Identify Substance G**: Precipitate G releases substance B (D₂O) upon heating. This indicates that G is a deuterated hydrate (a compound containing D₂O in its structure).\n3.  **Identify Gas W**: The gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. A simple molecule that fits this description is deuterium gas (D₂). Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n4.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G. The problem states that X contains a heavier isotope (which we know is deuterium, D) and that it and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of substance X perfectly. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water. For the reaction to produce deuterium gas (D₂), the other reactant must also be a source of deuterium. Therefore, liquid Y must be **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n5.  **Confirm the Reaction**: The reaction between Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (X) and heavy water (Y) is:\n    LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    This reaction produces deuterium gas (W) and aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a precipitate (G). Heating Al(OD)₃ yields aluminum oxide and heavy water (B). This confirms the identities of all substances.\n6.  **Confirm the Final Clue**: The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid into alcohol groups. The resulting product is a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. This final clue is consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n7.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass**: The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The molecule contains four atoms of the lightest element, in the form of Deuterium (²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu. The total mass from the lightest element is 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   The molecule contains one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminium. Aluminium's only stable isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass of approximately 27 amu. The total mass from the heaviest element is 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   The cumulative mass is the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided clues, the substances involved have been identified as follows:\n\n*   **Substance X**: Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). This is deduced from its nature as a powerful reducing agent (a close analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent in organic chemistry), its reaction to form the other identified products, and its role in the reduction of a keto acid. The reaction of a keto acid (containing a ketone and a carboxylic acid) with a strong reducing agent like LiAlH₄ (or its deuterated analog LiAlD₄) reduces both functional groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol which contains two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Liquid Y**: Heavy Water (D₂O). Its reaction with a deuteride source like LiAlD₄ is violent and produces the identified gas and precipitate.\n*   **Gas W**: Deuterium gas (D₂). A molecule of D₂ contains one proton and one neutron in each of its two atoms, for a total of two protons and two neutrons, fitting the description of having an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n*   **Precipitate G**: Aluminium Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). This is formed from the reaction of LiAlD₄ and D₂O.\n*   **Substance B**: Heavy Water (D₂O). When precipitate G, Al(OD)₃, is heated, it decomposes and releases heavy water. The melting point of heavy water is 276.97 K (3.82 °C), which is very close to the stated 277 K.\n\nThe core reaction is:\nLiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD\n\nWith Substance X identified as LiAlD₄, the final calculation can be performed. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within LiAlD₄.\n\n1.  **Elements in LiAlD₄**: Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n2.  **Atomic Masses (using mass numbers for isotopes)**:\n    *   Deuterium (²H or D): Mass number = 2\n    *   Lithium (assumed to be the most common isotope, ⁷Li): Mass number = 7\n    *   Aluminium (only stable isotope is ²⁷Al): Mass number = 27\n3.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**:\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (mass ≈ 2 u).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (mass ≈ 27 u).\n4.  **Cumulative Mass Calculation**: The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   There are four atoms of the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   There is one atom of the heaviest element (Aluminium): 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative mass is the sum of these values: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on the chemical puzzle provided, the following substances have been identified:\n\n*   **Substance X:** Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). This is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, analogous to the very common lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). It contains deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Liquid Y:** Heavy water (D₂O).\n*   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas (D₂). A molecule of D₂ contains one proton and one neutron in each atom, for a total of two protons and two neutrons, matching the description of having an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n*   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Lithium aluminum deuteride reacts violently with water (or heavy water) to produce a precipitate of aluminum hydroxide (or deuteroxide).\n*   **Substance B:** Heavy water (D₂O). The thermal decomposition of aluminum hydroxide yields alumina and water. Similarly, aluminum deuteroxide yields alumina and heavy water. The melting point of heavy water is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K. This is extremely close to the given 277 K. For comparison, normal water freezes at 273.15 K.\n\nThe reaction of a keto acid with LiAlD₄ (Substance X) would reduce the ketone group to an alcohol, resulting in a hydroxy acid which still contains two oxygen atoms, consistent with the clue.\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H) (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n2.  **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n3.  **Calculate the mass of the lightest element's atoms:** Substance X contains four atoms of the hydrogen isotope deuterium (²H).
