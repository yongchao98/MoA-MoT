Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\n\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light. The maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n    *   For system 1, Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ.\n    *   For system 2, Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that the star masses are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planet masses are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). For a unique solution to exist, we must make the standard assumption that the orbital inclinations are also similar (`sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`). Under these conditions, all terms in the formula are constant for both systems except for K and P. This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n    *   `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Periods (P₂ / P₁):**\n    From the proportionality, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    To solve for the desired ratio `P₂ / P₁`, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute the known ratio of the velocity amplitudes (`K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`) into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Physical Intuition:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ vs 5 mÅ), which means its star is moving faster. A faster stellar wobble is generally caused by a planet in a closer, shorter-period orbit. Therefore, we should expect the period of planet #2 to be shorter than that of planet #1, meaning the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. This immediately eliminates options A, B, and C.\n*   **Correct Proportionality:** The relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` is crucial. A common mistake is to get the exponent or the sign wrong.\n*   **Correct Ratio:** The final calculation requires cubing the ratio of the velocities. It is important to use the correct ratio, `K₁ / K₂`, to find `P₂ / P₁`. Using the inverse (`K₂ / K₁`) would lead to an incorrect answer of `(7/5)³ ≈ 2.74`.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** Almost all candidate answers (13 out of 15) correctly derive the physics and arrive at the numerical result of ~0.36. The discrepancies are primarily in matching this value to the correct lettered option, as the option lists seem to vary between agents.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a value of approximately 0.36. Based on the options provided in the question:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.40\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light. The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift (Δλ_max), given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    Therefore: `K ∝ Δλ_max`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of the RV Amplitudes:**\n    We are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n3.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n    `K ∝ (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))`\n    where `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, `P` is the orbital period, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n4.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that the stars have identical masses (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). For a unique solution to exist, we must also make the standard assumption that the orbital inclinations are comparable (`sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`). Under these conditions, all terms in the proportionality are constant for both systems except for K and P.\n\n5.  **Establish the Key Proportionality:**\n    The relationship simplifies to:\n    `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n    This means the RV amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    We can write a ratio for the two systems based on the proportionality:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    We want to find the ratio `P₂ / P₁`. To do this, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value:**\n    Substitute the ratio of the RV amplitudes (`K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`) into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.36. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the length of the orbital period of planet #1. Comparing this result to the provided options, it matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proportionality:** The core of the problem is understanding the chain of proportionality: the observed wavelength shift `Δλ` is proportional to the star's velocity amplitude `K`, which in turn is proportional to `P^(-1/3)`.\n*   **The Key Formula:** The relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` is crucial. It is derived by combining the definition of the star's velocity due to its planet with Kepler's Third Law, assuming constant stellar and planetary masses.\n*   **Algebraic Accuracy:** It is easy to make a mistake with the exponents. The final ratio of the periods is `(K₁/K₂)^3`, not `(K₂/K₁)^3` or a different power.\n*   **Physical Intuition:** A larger wavelength shift (planet #2) implies a larger stellar velocity. A larger velocity is caused by a stronger gravitational interaction, which typically means the planet is closer to the star. A closer orbit corresponds to a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we should expect the period of planet #2 to be shorter than that of planet #1, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` to be less than 1, which it is.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the stated conditions (equal star and planet masses) and the implicit, but standard, assumption that the orbital inclinations (`i`) are the same for both systems.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the relationship between the observable quantity (wavelength shift) and the physical parameters of the exoplanet system (orbital period). I will then use the information given in the problem to establish a mathematical relationship and solve for the required ratio.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The Radial Velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light. The magnitude of the wavelength shift, Δλ, is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift, given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K. Therefore, `K ∝ Δλ`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n    `K ∝ (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))`\n    where `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, `P` is the orbital period, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply Problem Conditions:** The problem states that the stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). For a unique solution, we must also assume the orbital inclinations are the same (`sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`), which is a standard assumption in such problems. Under these conditions, all terms in the proportionality are constant for both systems except for K and P. The relationship simplifies to `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n\n4.  **Combine and Solve:** We have two relationships for K: `K ∝ Δλ` and `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. Combining them, we get `Δλ ∝ P^(-1/3)`. We can write this as a ratio for the two systems:\n    `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** We can now solve for the ratio of the periods, `P₂ / P₁`, by cubing both sides of the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3`\n    Plugging in the given values (`Δλ₁ = 5` and `Δλ₂ = 7`), we can calculate the final answer.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that the unstated orbital inclinations (`i`) are similar for both systems.\n*   **Proportionality:** The core of the solution is understanding the two key proportionalities: `K ∝ Δλ` and `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n*   **Algebraic Manipulation:** It is crucial to handle the exponents correctly. The final ratio of periods `P₂ / P₁` is proportional to the cube of the ratio of wavelength shifts `(Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3`.\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 vs 5 mÅ), which means its star is moving faster. A faster stellar wobble is typically caused by a planet in a closer, shorter-period orbit. Therefore, we should expect the period of planet #2 to be shorter than that of planet #1, meaning the ratio `P₂ / P₁` should be less than 1.

In this method, the periodic shift in a star's spectral line wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight (the radial velocity). The maximum value of this periodic shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, which is denoted as K.\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n    *   For planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)\n    (This is the standard formula assuming the planet's mass, mₚ, is much smaller than the star's mass, M_star).\n    Here, P is the orbital period, G is the gravitational constant, mₚ is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and i is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Conditions to Simplify the Relationship:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (M_star₁ = M_star₂).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂).\n    *   For a unique solution to exist from the given information, we must assume the viewing conditions are comparable, meaning the orbital inclinations are the same (sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)).\n    *   G and 2π are constants.\n\n    With all other factors being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct proportionality between K and P:\n    *   K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio of the Periods:**\n    From the relationship K ∝ P^(-1/3), we can write a ratio for the two systems:\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Solve for the Desired Ratio (P₂ / P₁):**\n    We want to find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. To solve for this, we cube both sides of the equation from the previous step:\n    *   (K₁ / K₂)³ = P₂ / P₁\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute the ratio of the velocity amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts) into the equation:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n### Careful Points and Sanity Check\n\n*   **Proportionality:** The core of the problem is understanding that K ∝ Δλ and K ∝ P^(-1/3).\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the stated conditions (equal star and planet masses) and the standard implicit assumption that the orbital inclinations are the same.\n*   **Inverse Relationship:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ vs 5 mÅ), which means its star has a higher velocity amplitude (K₂ > K₁). A higher velocity is generally caused by a stronger gravitational pull from a closer planet. A closer planet has a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we should expect P₂ to be shorter than P₁, meaning the ratio P₂ / P₁ should be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this check.\n*   **Exponents:** It is crucial to handle the exponents correctly. The final ratio of the periods is the cube of the ratio of the velocities, `(K₁/K₂)^3`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio P₂ / P₁ is approximately 0.36.

The correct approach involves a step-by-step derivation using the principles of the radial velocity (RV) method.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The RV method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light. The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. Therefore, the maximum velocity, or semi-amplitude (K), is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n    *   This allows us to establish the ratio of the velocity amplitudes for the two stars:\n        K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude is:\n    K ∝ (mₚ * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))\n    where mₚ is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, P is the orbital period, and *i* is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:** The problem states that the star masses are identical (M_star₁ = M_star₂) and the planet masses are similar (mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂). For a solvable problem of this type, it is a standard assumption that the unknown inclinations are also similar, meaning the entire `mₚ * sin(i)` term is constant for both systems. With these factors and the star's mass being constant, the relationship simplifies to a direct proportionality between K and P:\n    *   K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:** We can now create an equation from the proportionality for the two systems:\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the required ratio, P₂ / P₁, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n5.  **Substitute Values and Find the Final Answer:** We substitute the known ratio of the velocity amplitudes (K₁ / K₂ = 5/7) into the equation:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proportionality:** It is crucial to correctly identify that the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the velocity amplitude (K), but K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period (P).\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the given conditions (equal star and planet masses) and the standard implicit assumption that the orbital inclinations are comparable.\n*   **Algebra:** The final step involves cubing the ratio, not taking the cube root or inverting it incorrectly. A quick check confirms the result: Planet #2 causes a larger velocity shift (K₂ > K₁), which implies it has a stronger gravitational influence (likely due to a closer orbit), and therefore a shorter period (P₂ < P₁). The resulting ratio of ~0.36 is less than 1, which is consistent with this physical intuition.\n*   **Option Matching:** The candidate answers are nearly unanimous in calculating the value ~0.36 but show significant confusion in matching this to the correct letter.

The maximum periodic shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted as K.\n\n*   **Relationship:** `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n*   **Given Data:**\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n*   **Ratio of Velocities:** The ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\n    `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`\n\n### Step 2: Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (P)\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is:\n`K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\nwhere `P` is the orbital period, `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Problem's Conditions\nThe problem states that several key parameters are the same for both systems:\n*   The stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n*   The planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n*   A standard assumption in such problems is that the unknown orbital inclinations are comparable, so `sin(i₁)` ≈ `sin(i₂)`.\n\nWith these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct relationship between K and P:\n`K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\nWe can now set up an equation using the ratios from Step 1 and Step 3:\n`K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nWe know that `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`. Substituting this into the equation:\n`5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nTo find the ratio of the periods (`P₂ / P₁`), we cube both sides of the equation:\n`P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n`P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343`\n`P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n*   **Physical Intuition:** Planet #2 causes a larger velocity shift (7 mÅ vs 5 mÅ). A larger stellar velocity is typically caused by a planet that is either more massive or in a closer orbit. Since the planet masses are similar, the larger velocity implies a closer orbit, which means a shorter orbital period. Therefore, the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1, which our result confirms.\n*   **Algebra:** The most common mistake is inverting the ratio or misplacing the exponent. The final relationship is `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)³`.\n*   **Matching the Answer:** The calculated value is approximately 0.36. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) ~ 1.40\n    *   B) ~ 0.36\n    *   C) ~ 0.85\n    *   D) ~ 1.96\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)\nThe Radial Velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light. The magnitude of the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift, given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted as K.\n\n*   **Relationship:** `K ∝ Δλ`\n*   **Given values:**\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n*   **Ratio of amplitudes:** The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\n    `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`\n\n### Step 2: Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K for a planet in a circular orbit is derived from Kepler's and Newton's laws. It is given by:\n`K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n(This is the standard formula where the planet's mass `m_p` is much smaller than the star's mass `M_star`).\n\nThe problem provides key information that simplifies this relationship:\n*   The stars have the same mass: `M_star₁ = M_star₂`.\n*   The planets have similar masses: `m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂`.\n*   For a unique solution, we must assume the viewing conditions are comparable, meaning the orbital inclinations are the same: `sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`.\n\nWith these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct proportionality between K and the orbital period P:\n`K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n### Step 3: Combine the Relationships and Solve for the Period Ratio\nWe now have two ways to express the ratio of the K values. We can set them equal to each other.\n\nFrom Step 2, we have:\n`K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nFrom Step 1, we know `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation:\n`5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nTo find the ratio of the periods (`P₂ / P₁`), we must cube both sides of the equation:\n`P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Value\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the ratio:\n`P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343`\n`P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n1.  **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ > 5 mÅ), which means its star is moving faster (K₂ > K₁). A faster stellar wobble is typically caused by a planet in a closer, shorter-period orbit. Therefore, we should expect the period of planet #2 to be shorter than that of planet #1, meaning the ratio `P₂ / P₁` should be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 confirms this.\n2.  **Algebra:** The most common mistake is mishandling the exponents. It is crucial to recognize that `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` leads to `P ∝ K⁻³`, so the ratio of periods is the cube of the inverse ratio of the velocities.\n3.  **Matching to Options:** The calculated value is approximately 0.36.

The observed shift in a star's spectral line wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift (Δλ_max), given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted as K.\n    Therefore: `K ∝ Δλ_max`.\n    This allows us to establish the ratio of the velocity amplitudes from the given wavelength shifts:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that several key parameters are the same for both systems:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   A standard and necessary assumption for this type of problem is that the orbital inclinations are also similar (`i₁ ≈ i₂`).\n    Given these conditions, all terms in the formula for K are constant for both systems except for the orbital period, P. This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n    `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Combine and Solve for the Period Ratio (P₂ / P₁):**\n    We can now set up a ratio for the two systems using the proportionality from Step 3:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    We want to find the ratio `P₂ / P₁`. To do this, we can cube both sides of the equation:\n    `(K₁ / K₂)^3 = P₂ / P₁`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute the ratio of the velocity amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts) from Step 1 into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3 = (5 / 7)^3`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Proportionality:** The most common source of error is misremembering the relationship between K and P. It is `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n*   **Correct Ratio:** The question asks for the ratio of planet #2's period to planet #1's period (`P₂ / P₁`). A larger wavelength shift (planet #2) implies a larger stellar velocity, which is caused by a planet in a closer, shorter-period orbit. Therefore, the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. This provides a quick sanity check, confirming that the ratio should be `(5/7)^3` and not `(7/5)^3`.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that \"similar masses\" in an RV context implies that the measured quantity `m_p * sin(i)` is the same for both systems.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value is approximately 0.36.

A faster stellar wobble is generally caused by a planet that is either more massive or closer. Since the planet masses are similar, the planet must be in a closer, shorter-period orbit. Therefore, the ratio P₂/P₁ must be less than 1, which rules out options A and B.\n*   **Algebra:** The final step requires cubing the ratio of the velocities (or wavelength shifts). A common mistake is to invert the ratio or use the wrong exponent. The correct relationship is `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)³`.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value is ~0.36.

    "An analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a unanimous agreement on the underlying physics and the resulting calculation.

For a unique solution to be possible, it is a standard assumption in such problems that the orbital inclinations are also similar (`sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`). With all other factors being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a core proportionality:\n    *   **Simplified Relationship:** `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can establish a ratio for the two systems:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    The question asks for the ratio of planet #2's period to planet #1's period (`P₂ / P₁`).

For planets of similar mass, a faster stellar wobble is caused by a planet in a closer orbit. A closer orbit corresponds to a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we should expect the period of planet #2 to be shorter than that of planet #1, meaning the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. This check immediately eliminates options A, B, and C, leaving D as the only plausible answer.\n*   **Algebraic Manipulation:** It is crucial to handle the exponents correctly. The relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` leads to `P ∝ K⁻³`, so the final ratio of periods `P₂ / P₁` is equal to the cube of the ratio of velocities `(K₁ / K₂)³`.

The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift (Δλ_max), given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    Therefore: `K ∝ Δλ_max`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of the RV Amplitudes:**\n    We are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n3.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n    `K ∝ (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))`\n    where `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, `P` is the orbital period, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n4.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that the stars have identical masses (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).

It is derived by combining the definition of the star's velocity due to its planet with Kepler's Third Law, assuming constant stellar and planetary masses.\n*   **Algebraic Accuracy:** It is easy to make a mistake with the exponents. The final ratio of the periods is `(K₁/K₂)^3`, not `(K₂/K₁)^3` or a different power.\n*   **Physical Intuition:** A larger wavelength shift (planet #2) implies a larger stellar velocity. A larger velocity is caused by a stronger gravitational interaction, which typically means the planet is closer to the star. A closer orbit corresponds to a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we should expect the period of planet #2 to be shorter than that of planet #1, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` to be less than 1, which it is.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the stated conditions (equal star and planet masses) and the implicit, but standard, assumption that the orbital inclinations (`i`) are the same for both systems.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the relationship between the observable quantity (wavelength shift) and the physical parameters of the exoplanet system (orbital period).

The magnitude of the wavelength shift, Δλ, is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift, given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K. Therefore, `K ∝ Δλ`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n    `K ∝ (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))`\n    where `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, `P` is the orbital period, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply Problem Conditions:** The problem states that the stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). For a unique solution, we must also assume the orbital inclinations are the same (`sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`), which is a standard assumption in such problems. Under these conditions, all terms in the proportionality are constant for both systems except for K and P. The relationship simplifies to `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n\n4.  **Combine and Solve:** We have two relationships for K: `K ∝ Δλ` and `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. Combining them, we get `Δλ ∝ P^(-1/3)`. We can write this as a ratio for the two systems:\n    `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** We can now solve for the ratio of the periods, `P₂ / P₁`, by cubing both sides of the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3`\n    Plugging in the given values (`Δλ₁ = 5` and `Δλ₂ = 7`), we can calculate the final answer.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that the unstated orbital inclinations (`i`) are similar for both systems.\n*   **Proportionality:** The core of the solution is understanding the two key proportionalities: `K ∝ Δλ` and `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n*   **Algebraic Manipulation:** It is crucial to handle the exponents correctly. The final ratio of periods `P₂ / P₁` is proportional to the cube of the ratio of wavelength shifts `(Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3`.\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 vs 5 mÅ), which means its star is moving faster. A faster stellar wobble is typically caused by a planet in a closer, shorter-period orbit. Therefore, we should expect the period of planet #2 to be shorter than that of planet #1, meaning the ratio `P₂ / P₁` should be less than 1.

In this method, the periodic shift in a star's spectral line wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight (the radial velocity).

A higher velocity is generally caused by a stronger gravitational pull from a closer planet. A closer planet has a shorter orbital period.

The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. Therefore, the maximum velocity, or semi-amplitude (K), is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n    *   This allows us to establish the ratio of the velocity amplitudes for the two stars:\n        K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude is:\n    K ∝ (mₚ * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))\n    where mₚ is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, P is the orbital period, and *i* is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:** The problem states that the star masses are identical (M_star₁ = M_star₂) and the planet masses are similar (mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂). For a solvable problem of this type, it is a standard assumption that the unknown inclinations are also similar, meaning the entire `mₚ * sin(i)` term is constant for both systems. With these factors and the star's mass being constant, the relationship simplifies to a direct proportionality between K and P:\n    *   K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:** We can now create an equation from the proportionality for the two systems:\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the required ratio, P₂ / P₁, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n5.  **Substitute Values and Find the Final Answer:** We substitute the known ratio of the velocity amplitudes (K₁ / K₂ = 5/7) into the equation:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proportionality:** It is crucial to correctly identify that the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the velocity amplitude (K), but K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period (P).\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the given conditions (equal star and planet masses) and the standard implicit assumption that the orbital inclinations are comparable.\n*   **Algebra:** The final step involves cubing the ratio, not taking the cube root or inverting it incorrectly. A quick check confirms the result: Planet #2 causes a larger velocity shift (K₂ > K₁), which implies it has a stronger gravitational influence (likely due to a closer orbit), and therefore a shorter period (P₂ < P₁). The resulting ratio of ~0.36 is less than 1, which is consistent with this physical intuition.\n*   **Option Matching:** The candidate answers are nearly unanimous in calculating the value ~0.36 but show significant confusion in matching this to the correct letter.

Comparing this to the provided options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the relationship between the observed Doppler shift of a star's light and the orbital period of a planet causing that shift.\n\n**1. Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\n\nThe Radial Velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's spectral lines. The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight (v_r). The maximum periodic shift (Δλ_max) given in the problem corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted as K.\n\n*   **Relationship:** K ∝ Δλ_max\n*   For planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom.\n*   For planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n**2. Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\nThis formula is an excellent approximation when the planet's mass (mₚ) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), which is true for a Neptune-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star.\n\nThe problem states:\n*   The stars have the same mass: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n*   The planets have similar masses: mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂.\n*   A standard and necessary assumption for such problems is that the orbital inclinations are comparable, so sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂).\n\nWith these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct proportionality between K and the orbital period P:\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n**3. Combine and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n\nWe can now express the relationship between the two systems as a ratio:\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nWe want to find the ratio P₂ / P₁, which tells us how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1. To do this, we first solve for P₁ / P₂ by cubing both sides of the equation:\n(K₂ / K₁)³ = P₁ / P₂\n\nNow, we can find P₂ / P₁ by taking the reciprocal:\nP₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nSubstitute the known ratio of the velocity amplitudes (K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7) into the equation:\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n### Careful Points and Sanity Check\n\n*   **Proportionality:** It is crucial to correctly identify that K ∝ P^(-1/3). A common mistake is to miss the exponents, which would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** The question asks for P₂ / P₁. The calculation naturally leads to (K₂ / K₁)³ = P₁ / P₂, so a final inversion is necessary to get P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³.\n*   **Physical Intuition:** Planet #2 causes a larger velocity shift in its star (K₂ > K₁). A larger velocity shift implies a stronger gravitational interaction, which for a given mass usually means the planet is in a closer orbit. A closer orbit corresponds to a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we should expect P₂ to be shorter than P₁, meaning the ratio P₂ / P₁ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 confirms this intuition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.36. Comparing this to the provided options:\n\nA) ~ 1.96\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light. The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift given in the problem corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    Therefore, `K ∝ Δλ`.\n    We can establish the ratio of the velocity amplitudes for the two stars:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is:\n    `K ∝ (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))`\n    where `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, `P` is the orbital period, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that the stars have identical masses (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). For a solvable problem of this type, we assume the unknown inclinations are also similar (`sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`). With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct relationship between K and P:\n    `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:**\n    We can now write a ratio for the two systems using this proportionality:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). To solve for this, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    `(K₁ / K₂)^3 = P₂ / P₁`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute the ratio of the velocity amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts) into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proportionality:** It is crucial to correctly identify that the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the velocity amplitude (K), and that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period (P).\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** A common mistake is inverting the ratio. The final ratio for the periods (`P₂ / P₁`) is equal to the cube of the ratio of the velocities (`K₁ / K₂`), not (`K₂ / K₁`).\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ vs. 5 mÅ), which implies a larger stellar velocity (K₂ > K₁). A larger velocity is typically caused by a planet in a closer, and therefore shorter-period, orbit. This means we should expect P₂ to be less than P₁, so the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this check.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value of ~0.36 must be compared to the original list of options: A) ~ 1.40, B) ~ 1.96, C) ~ 0.36, D) ~ 0.85.

A faster stellar wobble is generally caused by a planet that is either more massive or closer. Since the planet masses are similar, the planet must be in a closer, shorter-period orbit. Therefore, the ratio P₂/P₁ must be less than 1, which rules out options A and B.\n*   **Algebra:** The final step requires cubing the ratio of the velocities (or wavelength shifts).
