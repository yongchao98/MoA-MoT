    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Model and Energy Levels:**\n    The problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). The energy levels for this model are given by the sum of vibrational and rotational energies:\n    E(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = (v + 1/2)ħω + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J+1)\n    where:\n    *   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...)\n    *   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...)\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration\n    *   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n\n2.  **Determine the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the state with the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both `v` and `J` are at their minimum values: v = 0 and J = 0.\n        So, the initial state is (v=0, J=0).\n    *   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" We must consider the selection rules for a photon absorption in a rovibrational transition:\n        *   Δv = +1 (for absorption)\n        *   ΔJ = ±1\n    *   Starting from the initial state (v=0, J=0), the only possible transition according to these rules is:\n        *   Δv = +1  =>  v_final = 1\n        *   ΔJ = +1  =>  J_final = 1 (since J cannot be negative, ΔJ = -1 is not possible from J=0).\n    *   Therefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n    *   *Note: Although a purely rotational transition (v=0, J=0 -> v=0, J=1) has a lower energy, the options provided do not match this small energy change. The wording of the question combined with the options points towards a rovibrational transition, which is a much more common and significant absorption feature.*\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of the Transition (ΔE):**\n    The energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    ΔE = E_final - E_initial = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0)\n\n    *   E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + (ħ² / I)\n    *   E(0, 0) = (0 + 1/2)ħω + (ħ² / 2I) * 0(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n\n    *   ΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + (ħ² / I) ] - [ (1/2)ħω ] = ħω + (ħ² / I)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Physical Parameters (I):**\n    To find ΔE, we need to calculate the moment of inertia `I`.\n    *   `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass and `R` is the bond length.\n    *   `R` = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n    *   The reduced mass `μ` is calculated as:\n        μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n        μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.81818 amu.\n    *   Convert `μ` to kilograms (1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg):\n        μ ≈ 1.81818 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.01916 x 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n    *   Now, calculate `I`:\n        I = (3.01916 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.20766 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m².\n\n5.  **Compute the Total Energy Change (ΔE):**\n    Now substitute the values into the equation for ΔE.\n    *   ΔE = ħω + (ħ² / I)\n    *   Vibrational part (ħω) = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.21828 x 10⁻²⁰ J.\n    *   Rotational part (ħ²/I) = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.20766 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.201 x 10⁻²³ J.\n    *   Total ΔE = (4.21828 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (0.009201 x 10⁻²⁰ J) = 4.22748 x 10⁻²⁰ J.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p):**\n    The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by `E = pc`, where `c` is the speed of light (≈ 2.9979 x 10⁸ m/s).\n    *   p = ΔE / c\n    *   p = (4.22748 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.9979 x 10⁸ m/s)\n    *   p ≈ 1.4101 x 10⁻²⁸ J·s/m (or N·s).\n\nTo ensure precision, the calculation is performed using a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\nc = 2.99792458e8         # Speed of light in m/s\namu_to_kg = 1.66053906660e-27 # amu to kg conversion factor\n\n# Given data\nMx_amu = 20.0\nMy_amu = 2.0\nR = 2.0e-10                # Bond length in m\nomega = 4.0e14             # Angular frequency in rad/s\n\n# 1. Calculate reduced mass (mu) in kg\nmu = (Mx_amu * My_amu) / (Mx_amu + My_amu) * amu_to_kg\n\n# 2. Calculate moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu * R**2\n\n# 3. Calculate the energy of the transition (delta_E)\n# Transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1)\n# delta_E = E(1,1) - E(0,0) = (hbar*omega) + (hbar^2 / I)\nE_vibrational = h_bar * omega\nE_rotational_term = h_bar**2 / I\ndelta_E = E_vibrational + E_rotational_term\n\n# 4. Calculate the photon's momentum (p)\np = delta_E / c\n\nprint(f\"{p:.3e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n1.410e-28\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated momentum is approximately 1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s. This value corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
