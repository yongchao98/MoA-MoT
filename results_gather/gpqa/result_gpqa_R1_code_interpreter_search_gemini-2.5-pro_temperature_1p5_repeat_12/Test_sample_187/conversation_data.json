    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the interplanar distance for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal, given its lattice parameters.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral. This is crucial as it determines the correct formula to use.\n    *   Lattice Parameter (`a`): The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. For a rhombohedral crystal where all axes and angles are equal, this is the lattice constant `a`. So, `a` = 10 Å.\n    *   Interaxial Angles (`α`, `β`, `γ`): It's given that `α = β = γ = 30°`.\n    *   Miller Indices (`h`, `k`, `l`): The plane is specified as (111), so `h`=1, `k`=1, and `l`=1.\n\n3.  **Select the Correct Formula:** For a rhombohedral crystal system, the formula for calculating the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk + kl + lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n4.  **Plan the Calculation:** The formula involves several terms. To avoid manual calculation errors, it's best to use a computational tool like Python. The plan is to substitute all the given values into the formula and solve for `d_hkl`.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation (using Python):**\n    *   Substitute `h=1`, `k=1`, `l=1`, `a=10`, and `α=30°` into the formula.\n    *   Calculate the required trigonometric values: `sin(30°)`, `cos(30°)`, `cos²(30°)`, and `cos³(30°)`. Note that standard math libraries in programming languages use radians, so a conversion from degrees to radians is necessary.\n    *   Calculate the combinations of Miller indices: `h²+k²+l²` and `hk+kl+lh`.\n    *   Compute the numerator and the denominator of the main formula separately for clarity.\n    *   Calculate the value of `1/d²`.\n    *   Finally, compute `d` by taking the square root of the reciprocal of the result (`d = 1 / sqrt(1/d²)`).\n\n    The provided Python code does exactly this:\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Given values\n    a = 10.0  # Angstrom\n    h, k, l = 1, 1, 1\n    alpha_deg = 30.0\n\n    # Convert angle to radians for math functions\n    alpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n    # Calculate trigonometric components\n    cos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n    sin_alpha = math.sin(alpha_rad)\n    cos2_alpha = cos_alpha**2\n    cos3_alpha = cos_alpha**3\n\n    # Calculate sums of Miller indices products\n    h2_k2_l2 = h**2 + k**2 + l**2  # 1+1+1 = 3\n    hk_kl_lh = h*k + k*l + l*h    # 1+1+1 = 3\n\n    # Calculate the numerator of the formula\n    numerator = h2_k2_l2 * sin_alpha**2 + 2 * hk_kl_lh * (cos2_alpha - cos_alpha)\n\n    # Calculate the denominator of the formula\n    denominator = a**2 * (1 - 3 * cos2_alpha + 2 * cos3_alpha)\n\n    # Calculate 1/d^2\n    inv_d_squared = numerator / denominator\n\n    # Calculate d\n    d = 1 / math.sqrt(inv_d_squared)\n\n    print(f\"The interplanar distance for the (111) plane is: {d:.2f} Angstrom\")\n    ```\n\n6.  **Interpret the Result:** The code execution provided the output: `The interplanar distance for the (111) plane is: 9.54 Angstrom`.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:** The calculated value is 9.54 Å. Comparing this with the given choices:\n    *   A) 9.54 Angstrom\n    *   B) 8.95 Angstrom\n    *   C) 9.08 Angstrom\n    *   D) 10.05 Angstrom\n\n    The calculated value matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
