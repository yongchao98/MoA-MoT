    "Annihilation Process Analysis: $p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\n**1. Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\nThe fundamental principle we'll use is the conservation of total energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n\n**2. Initial State Energy ($E_{initial}$):**\n*   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest before the annihilation.\n*   Therefore, the initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies.\n*   The mass of a proton is equal to the mass of an antiproton ($m_p = m_{\\bar{p}}$).\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938.3$ MeV.\n*   So, $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Final State Energy ($E_{final}$):**\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n*   All four particles have the same rest mass, given by $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n*   Due to the conservation of momentum (starting from a net momentum of zero), the four resulting particles will fly apart, and by symmetry, they will all have the same speed, $v$, and thus the same total energy, $E_A$.\n*   The total energy of a single relativistic particle A is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n*   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles: $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n*   Substituting the given mass of particle A: $E_{final} = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4. Equating Energies and Solving for Velocity:**\n*   According to the conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n*   $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   We can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$.\n*   Now, we solve for the velocity, $v$, using the definition of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n*   The velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.769c$.\n*   Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 0.96c\n    B) 0.91c\n    C) 0.77c\n    D) 0.86c\n*   The calculated value is closest to 0.77c.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a script for the computation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.272\n\n# Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate the initial energy (2 * proton rest mass energy)\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# From conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# We can find the Lorentz factor, gamma.\ngamma = E_initial / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Now, we find the velocity v from gamma.\n# The relationship is v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nv_over_c = math.sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma**2))\n\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {v_over_c:.3f}c\")\n```\n>>>\nThe velocity of particle A is 0.769c\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The core principle to solve this problem is the **conservation of total relativistic energy**. The total energy of the system before the annihilation must equal the total energy of the system after the annihilation.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial energy ($E_{initial}$):**\n    *   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This implies its kinetic energy is negligible. In the center-of-mass frame, for the initial momentum to be zero, both particles must be nearly at rest. Therefore, we can approximate their initial energy as just their rest mass energies.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton ($m_p = m_{\\bar{p}}$).\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton is a known value: $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton:\n        $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n        $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n3.  **Define the final energy ($E_{final}$):**\n    *   The final system consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n    *   We assume $m_{A^+} = m_{A^-} = m_A$. The rest mass energy for particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Due to the conservation of momentum (the initial momentum is zero), the four resulting particles must move away from the annihilation point in such a way that their total momentum is zero. By symmetry, it is reasonable to conclude that all four particles will have the same speed, $v$, and therefore the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The total relativistic energy of a single particle A is given by the formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n        $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n        $E_{final} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Apply energy conservation and solve for velocity ($v$):**\n    *   Equate the initial and final energies:\n        $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n        $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity, $v$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the formula to solve for $v/c$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n        $v/c \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\n5.  **Compare with the options:**\n    The calculated velocity is approximately $v \\approx 0.769c$. This value is closest to option C.\n\nThe python code output of `0.769c` confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
