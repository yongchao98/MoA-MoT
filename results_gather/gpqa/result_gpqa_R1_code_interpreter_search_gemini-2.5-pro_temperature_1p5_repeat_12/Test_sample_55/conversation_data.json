    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\n\nThe problem asks about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n, l, m> = |3, 0, 0> (the 3s state) to the final state |1, 0, 0> (the 1s ground state). The decay occurs via **two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions**. This means the atom decays from the initial state to an intermediate state, and then from that intermediate state to the final state. Each of these two steps involves the emission of one photon.\n\n### 2. Applying Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m:\n*   **Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly one unit.\n*   **Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or ±1. This corresponds to the polarization of the emitted photon (Δm = 0 for linear polarization along the z-axis, Δm = ±1 for circular polarization in the x-y plane).\n*   **Δn = n_final - n_initial**: The principal quantum number can change by any integer value, but for a decay (emission), n must decrease (Δn < 0).\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State\n\nLet the intermediate state be |n', l', m'>.\n\n*   **First transition: |3, 0, 0> → |n', l', m'>**\n    *   Applying the Δl = ±1 rule to the initial state l=0: l' must be 0 ± 1, so **l' = 1**. The intermediate state must be a p-orbital.\n    *   Applying the Δm = 0, ±1 rule to the initial state m=0: m' can be 0+0, 0+1, or 0-1. So, **m' can be 0, 1, or -1**.\n    *   For the principal quantum number n', since this is a decay, n' < 3. The most probable transition is to the lowest possible energy level that satisfies the other rules. The n=2 level is lower in energy than n=3. The options provided in the question all use n'=2 as the intermediate state, which is the intermediate step of the famous Balmer-alpha transition (3s → 2p). So, the intermediate state is of the form **|2, 1, m'>**.\n\n*   **Second transition: |n', l', m'> = |2, 1, m'> → |1, 0, 0>**\n    *   Let's check if this is allowed.\n    *   Applying the Δl = ±1 rule: The transition is from l'=1 to l_final=0. So Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is a valid transition.\n    *   Applying the Δm = 0, ±1 rule: The transition is from m' to m_final=0. So Δm = 0 - m'. This must be 0, ±1. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate m' values (0, 1, -1).\n\n### 4. Identifying Possible Transition Routes\n\nBased on the selection rules, there are three possible cascade routes from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> through the n=2 manifold:\n1.  `|3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>`\n2.  `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>`\n3.  `|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>`\n\nAll options A, B, C, and D present one of these valid routes. To find the correct answer, we must calculate the probability of each route.\n\n### 5. Calculating the \"Probability\" (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe \"probability\" in this context refers to the branching ratio: for all atoms starting in |3,0,0> that decay via this two-step cascade, what fraction will take a specific path?\n\n*   **Probability of the first step: |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>**\n    *   The initial state |3,0,0> is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space.\n    *   Due to this rotational symmetry, there is no preference for emitting a photon with Δm=+1, Δm=0, or Δm=-1. Therefore, the transitions to the three possible m' sublevels (|2,1,1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,-1>) are equally probable.\n    *   The decay from the 3s state to the 2p manifold is the dominant decay channel for the 3s state. We can assume the total probability of transitioning to *any* of the 2p states is 1.\n    *   Since the three m' states are equally likely, the probability (branching ratio) of transitioning into any *specific* m' state is **1/3**.\n        *   BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n        *   BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n        *   BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n\n*   **Probability of the second step: |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\n    *   Once the atom is in one of the intermediate states, say |2,1,0>, it must decay further.\n    *   The only state with n < 2 that is accessible via an E1 transition (Δl = ±1) from the |2,1,m'> (2p) state is the |1,0,0> (1s) state.\n    *   Therefore, the decay from the 2p state to the 1s state is the only available E1 decay path. This means the branching ratio for this step is **1**.\n        *   BR(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1 (for m' = -1, 0, or 1).\n\n*   **Total Probability of a Cascade Route**\n    *   The total probability of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   For the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>:\n        Probability = BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) × BR(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>) = (1/3) × 1 = **1/3**.\n    *   Similarly, the probability for the routes via |2,1,1> and |2,1,-1> is also 1/3 each.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nWe have determined that any of the three possible cascade paths has a probability of 1/3. Now we compare this with the given options:\n\n*   A) `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>` and probability `2/3`. (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) `|3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>` and probability `1/4`. (Incorrect probability)\n*   C) `|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>` and probability `1/4`. (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>` and probability `1/3`. (**Correct** route and probability)\n\nTherefore, option D correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<D>>>"
