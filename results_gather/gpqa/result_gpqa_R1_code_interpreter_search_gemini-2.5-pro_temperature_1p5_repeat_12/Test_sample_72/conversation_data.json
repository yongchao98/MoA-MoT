    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given two astronauts with different masses (2m and 3m) moving at different relativistic speeds (0.6c and 0.5c) in the same direction. We need to find:\na) The relative speed (v_rel) between them.\nb) The total energy (E) of the system as observed from a stationary frame of reference.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nFor objects moving at relativistic speeds, we cannot simply subtract their velocities. We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula. The relative speed v_rel between two objects with velocities v1 and v2 (as measured in a stationary frame) moving in the same direction is given by:\n\nv_rel = |v1 - v2| / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nGiven:\n*   v1 = 0.6 c\n*   v2 = 0.5 c\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3 * c^2 / c^2)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428 c\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**a) Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n*   Mass (m1) = 2m\n*   Speed (v1) = 0.6c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\nγ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\nγ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nγ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)\nγ1 = 1 / 0.8\nγ1 = 1.25\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E1):\nE1 = γ1 * m1 * c²\nE1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c²\nE1 = 2.5 mc²\n\n**b) Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n*   Mass (m2) = 3m\n*   Speed (v2) = 0.5c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\nγ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\nγ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)\nγ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)\nγ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866\nγ2 ≈ 1.1547\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E2):\nE2 = γ2 * m2 * c²\nE2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c²\nE2 ≈ 3.4641 mc²\n\n**c) Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\nThe total energy is the sum of E1 and E2.\nE_total = E1 + E2\nE_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²\nE_total = 5.9641 mc²\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **4. Python Code for Precise Calculation**\nTo verify the manual calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm = 1 # We can use a relative mass unit\nc = 1 # We can use a relative speed unit, the final answer will be in terms of c and mc^2\n\n# Astronaut 1\nm1 = 2 * m\nv1 = 0.6 * c\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2 = 3 * m\nv2 = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- Calculate Relative Speed ---\n# v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c**2)\nv_rel = abs(v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c**2)\nv_rel_in_c = v_rel / c # Express as a factor of c\n\n# --- Calculate Total Energy ---\n# E = gamma * m * c^2\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\n# Astronaut 1 Energy\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v1**2 / c**2))\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 * c**2\n\n# Astronaut 2 Energy\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v2**2 / c**2))\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 * c**2\n\n# Total Energy\nE_total = E1 + E2\nE_total_in_mc2 = E_total / (m * c**2) # Express as a factor of mc^2\n\nprint(f\"Relative speed (v_rel): {v_rel_in_c:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"Total energy (E_total): {E_total_in_mc2:.2f}mc^2\")\n```\n>>>\nRelative speed (v_rel): 0.14c\nTotal energy (E_total): 5.96mc^2\n>>>\n\n### **5.

    "The code output you've provided is correct and aligns perfectly with the detailed reasoning.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Relative Speed (v_rel):**\n    The classical way of subtracting speeds (`0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c`) is incorrect at relativistic speeds. The correct formula is the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n    *   `v_rel = |v1 - v2| / (1 - (v1*v2)/c^2)`\n    *   `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c^2)`\n    *   `v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c`\n    *   This rounds to **0.14c**.\n\n2.  **Total Energy (E_total):**\n    The total energy is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts, where `E = γmc^2` and the Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   **Astronaut 1 (m1=2m, v1=0.6c):**\n        *   `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.6²) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1.25`\n        *   `E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n    *   **Astronaut 2 (m2=3m, v2=0.5c):**\n        *   `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.5²) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n        *   `E2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2`\n    *   **Total Energy:**\n        *   `E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2`\n        *   This rounds to **5.96 mc²**.\n\nThe calculated values `v_rel ≈ 0.14c` and `E ≈ 5.96 mc^2` match the output from the code and correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
