    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\n    1.  **Definition**: Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a hydrogen atom (proton) from an alpha-carbon (a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group) to the carbonyl oxygen atom, with a corresponding shift of a pi bond. For this to occur, there must be at least one hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon.\n\n    2.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone)**: The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at positions 1 and 4, and two C=C bonds at positions 2-3 and 5-6. Its chemical formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n        *   The alpha-carbons are the carbons adjacent to the C=O groups, which are C-2, C-3, C-5, and C-6.\n        *   All these alpha-carbons are sp²-hybridized as they are part of a carbon-carbon double bond.\n        *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not show tautomerism**.\n\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Its chemical formula is C₆H₆O₃.\n        *   The alpha-carbons are at positions 2, 4, and 6.\n        *   These carbons are sp³-hybridized and are CH₂ groups. Each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It can tautomerize to form its enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic compound and thus very stable.\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does show tautomerism**.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\n    1.  **Definition**: Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Let's analyze its structure.\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  An ester group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since the central carbon is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and **will show optical isomerism**.\n\n    3.  **Dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid).\n        *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the double bond.\n        *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n        *   The molecule has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Molecules with a center of symmetry are achiral.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is benzoquinone.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
