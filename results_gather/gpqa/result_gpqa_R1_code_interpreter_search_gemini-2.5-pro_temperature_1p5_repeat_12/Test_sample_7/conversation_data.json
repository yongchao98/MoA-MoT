    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2.**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` has 0% resistance, meaning it is completely susceptible to the disease. The wild-type has 100% resistance. This indicates that the G2 gene product is absolutely essential for the resistance phenotype.\n    *   The double mutants `g1g2` and `g2g3` also exhibit 0% resistance. This means that the effect of the `g2` mutation masks the effects of the `g1` (which would have 75% resistance) and `g3` (which would have 50% resistance) mutations.\n    *   This phenomenon, where the phenotype of one mutation (in this case, `g2`) masks the phenotype of another, is called **epistasis**. Specifically, `g2` is epistatic to `g1` and `g3`.\n    *   In a genetic pathway, this often implies that G2 is a crucial component upon which the functions of G1 and G3 depend. Given the information that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, the most logical conclusion is that **G2 is a master transcription factor** that regulates the entire resistance pathway. If G2 is knocked out, the downstream genes (like G1 and G3, or genes they regulate) are not activated, leading to a complete loss of resistance. This eliminates option C, which states that G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between Genes G1 and G3.**\n    *   The single mutants `g1` and `g3` have resistance levels of 75% and 50%, respectively. This means both genes contribute to the overall resistance, but they are not individually essential like G2.\n    *   Now, let's look at the `g1g3` double mutant, which has 10% resistance. If the genes acted in completely independent, additive pathways, we might expect a resistance of roughly 100% - (100%-75%) - (100%-50%) = 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%.\n    *   However, the observed resistance (10%) is much lower than the resistance of either single mutant and lower than the expected additive effect. This is a classic example of a **synergistic interaction**, also known as synthetic enhancement. This type of interaction suggests that G1 and G3 have functions that are at least partially overlapping or compensatory.\n    *   Among the given options, this relationship is best described as **gene redundancy**. While they are not fully redundant (as single knockouts have a clear effect), they act in parallel or have overlapping functions, so losing both is far more detrimental than losing just one. This supports the \"gene redundancy\" claim in option A.\n    *   Option D suggests \"pleiotropy\". Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple distinct traits. The experiment only measures one trait (disease resistance), so there is no evidence for pleiotropy. This makes option D unlikely.\n    *   Option B suggests they have the \"same promoter\". While possible if they are both regulated by G2, this is a statement about the regulatory mechanism, not a description of the observed functional interaction (synergy). \"Gene redundancy\" is a better description of the functional relationship shown by the phenotypic data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final claim about epistasis between G1 and G3.**\n    *   Option A claims \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". For G1 to be epistatic to G3, the phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant should be the same as the `g1` single mutant. The `g1g3` phenotype is 10% resistance, while the `g1` phenotype is 75% resistance. These are not the same.\n    *   Similarly, for G3 to be epistatic to G1 (Option B), the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) should match the `g3` phenotype (50%), which it does not.\n    *   Therefore, based on the standard definition of epistasis, there is no simple epistatic relationship between G1 and G3; their interaction is synergistic.\n    *   However, we must choose the best overall option. Let's review the options again:\n        *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor (Correct), G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (Correct), G1 is epistatic towards G3 (Incorrect by standard definition).**\n        *   B) G2 is a transcription factor (Correct), G1 and G3 has the same promoter (Possible but not proven), G3 is epistatic towards G1 (Incorrect).\n        *   C) G1 is a transcription factor (Incorrect).\n        *   D) G2 is a transcription factor (Correct), G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (Incorrect), G1 is epistatic towards G3 (Incorrect).\n\n    *   Comparing the valid options (A, B, D), Option A contains two strongly supported conclusions (\"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\"). The other options contain definitively incorrect (\"pleiotropy\") or less descriptive (\"same promoter\") statements. Despite the flaw in its third clause regarding epistasis, Option A provides the most accurate overall description of the genetic interactions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evidence strongly supports G2 being a master transcription factor and G1 and G3 having redundant/synergistic functions. Option A is the only choice that captures these two key findings.\n\n<<<A>>>"
