    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physical System:**\n    *   The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with a \"symmetry axis along the z-axis\".\n    *   An oscillating charge distribution is a source of electromagnetic radiation.\n    *   The simplest and most common model for such a source, especially when the size of the source is much smaller than the wavelength of radiation (`d << λ`), is an oscillating electric dipole. The oscillation of charge along the symmetry axis (z-axis) creates an electric dipole moment `p` oscillating in time, `p(t) = p₀ cos(ωt) ẑ`, where `ẑ` is the unit vector along the z-axis.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Electric Dipole Radiation:**\n    *   The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) in the radiation zone (far-field) by an oscillating electric dipole oriented along the z-axis is given by the Larmor formula:\n        `dP/dΩ = C * ω⁴ * sin²(θ)`\n    *   In this formula:\n        *   `C` is a constant that depends on fundamental constants (like the permeability of free space `μ₀`, the speed of light `c`) and the amplitude of the dipole moment (`p₀`). Its exact value is `μ₀ p₀² / (32π²c)`.\n        *   `ω` is the angular frequency of the oscillation.\n        *   `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n\n3.  **Determine the Wavelength Dependence:**\n    *   The power radiated per unit solid angle, which the problem calls `f(λ, θ)`, is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n    *   The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the expression `ω = 2πv/λ`, where `v` is the wave speed (here, `c`, the speed of light).\n    *   Therefore, the power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴`, or `λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   This eliminates options B (`λ⁻⁶`) and C (`λ⁻³`). We are left with options A and D.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Angular Dependence to Find the Fraction:**\n    *   The angular dependence of the radiated power is given by the `sin²(θ)` term.\n    *   The maximum power, `A`, is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = π/2` (or 90°), perpendicular to the axis of oscillation.\n    *   So, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * ω⁴ * sin²(90°) = C * ω⁴ * (1)² = C * ω⁴`.\n    *   We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n        `(dP/dΩ) at 30° = C * ω⁴ * sin²(30°)`.\n    *   To find the fraction of the maximum power `A`, we calculate the ratio:\n        `Fraction = [(dP/dΩ) at 30°] / A = [C * ω⁴ * sin²(30°)] / [C * ω⁴] = sin²(30°)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value of the Fraction:**\n    *   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    *   Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    *   This means the power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4` of the maximum power `A`.\n\n6.  **Combine the Results and Select the Correct Option:**\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    *   The wavelength dependence of the function `f` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   Comparing these results with the given options:\n        *   A) 1/4, `λ⁻⁴`\n        *   B) 3/4, `λ⁻⁶`\n        *   C) 1/4, `λ⁻³`\n        *   D) 1/2, `λ⁻⁴`\n    *   Option A perfectly matches both of our derived results.\n\nTo be certain of the trigonometric calculation, we can use a python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Calculate sin^2(30 degrees)\ntheta_deg = 30\ntheta_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\nfraction = np.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\nprint(f\"The fraction is: {fraction}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe fraction is: 0.25\n\nThe python code confirms that `sin²(30°)` is 0.25, which is equal to 1/4.\n\nThus, the fraction of A radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` is 1/4, and a possible form for the wavelength dependence of `f` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An oscillating charge distribution with a defined symmetry axis (z-axis) can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) from such a dipole is not uniform in all directions.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle in the far-field (radiation zone) by an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\nThe maximum power, `A`, is radiated when this expression is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\nSo, `A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\nWe need to find the fraction of `A` radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. The power at this angle is:\n\n`(dP/dΩ) at 30° ∝ sin²(30°)`\n\nThe fraction is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power `A`:\n\n`Fraction = [(dP/dΩ) at 30°] / A = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = sin²(30°) / 1`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`. Therefore:\n\n`Fraction = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nThe Python code you executed confirmed this result, yielding `0.25` (within floating-point precision).\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n\nAccording to Larmor's formula for dipole radiation, the total power radiated is proportional to the square of the acceleration of the charge. For a sinusoidal oscillation, this leads to a power dependence on the fourth power of the angular frequency (`ω⁴`).\n\nThe power per unit solid angle, which the problem calls `f(λ, θ)`, is therefore proportional to `ω⁴`:\n\n`f(λ, θ) ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by `ω = 2πc/λ`. Substituting this into the proportionality:\n\n`f(λ, θ) ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of electric dipole radiation and is also famously seen in Rayleigh scattering.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCombining the two results:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n*   The form of the power function `f` has a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
