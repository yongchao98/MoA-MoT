    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the key assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere. The number of stars (`N`) in any given volume (`V`) is simply `N = ρ * V`.\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars to distance:** We want to find the number of stars (`dN`) in a small range of distances. A natural way to do this is to consider a thin spherical shell of space with the observer at the center. Let the inner radius of this shell be `d` and the outer radius be `d + dd`, where `dd` is a very small thickness.\n    *   The volume of this thin spherical shell (`dV`) is approximately the surface area of the sphere (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the density `ρ` times this volume:\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Introduce Parallax (plx):** Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance to a star. When distance (`d`) is measured in parsecs, the parallax (`plx`) is measured in arcseconds.\n    *   `plx = 1/d`\n    *   This also means that `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Connect the distance interval (`dd`) to the parallax interval (`d(plx)`):** We need to find how a small range of distances (`dd`) relates to a small range of parallax (`d(plx)`). We can do this by taking the derivative of the parallax equation with respect to distance `d`:\n    *   `d(plx)/dd = d(1/d)/dd = -1/d²`\n    *   Rearranging this, we get: `dd = -d² * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the *number* of stars, which is a positive quantity, we can consider the magnitude of the relationship: `|dd| = d² * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substitute to find the number of stars in a parallax interval:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`.\n    *   We started with: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = d² * d(plx)` (using the magnitude):\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4πd² * (d² * d(plx)) = ρ * 4πd⁴ * d(plx)`\n    *   Now, substitute `d = 1/plx`:\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)⁴ * d(plx)`\n    *   `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Determine the final relationship:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the final equation from the previous step:\n    *   `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   In this expression, `4`, `π`, and `ρ` (the uniform star density) are all constants. Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n    *   `dN / d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Match with the given options:** This result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
