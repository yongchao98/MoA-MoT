    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg's Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle.\n\n1.  **Understand the Principle:** The uncertainty principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the quantum state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\n    The uncertainty in energy, ΔE, can be interpreted as the \"width\" of the energy level. A shorter lifetime (small Δt) leads to a larger energy width (large ΔE), meaning the energy of that state is less precisely defined.\n\n2.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:** To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the energy widths of the levels. The state with the *shorter lifetime* will have the *larger energy width*, and this width is the main factor limiting our ability to resolve the two levels. If the energy separation is smaller than this width, the two energy levels will overlap too much to be seen as distinct.\n\n3.  **Identify the Limiting State:**\n    *   State 1 has a lifetime Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ s.\n    *   State 2 has a lifetime Δt2 = 10⁻⁸ s.\n    *   Since Δt1 < Δt2, State 1 has the shorter lifetime and therefore the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE1). This is the limiting factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Energy Separation:** We need to calculate the energy uncertainty (ΔE1) corresponding to the shorter lifetime (Δt1). We can approximate the minimum required energy separation as being on the order of this uncertainty.\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1\n\n    Let's perform the calculation.\n    *   Value of ħ (reduced Planck constant) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    *   Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n\n    ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    So, for the energy levels to be resolved, their energy difference must be significantly greater than ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (<< 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV   (>> 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV   (<< 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV   (< 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n    Only option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy separation that is substantially larger than the energy width of the broader state. This large separation ensures that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<B>>>"
