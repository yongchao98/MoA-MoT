    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze two aspects of oxygen's behavior in electrochemical reactions: its thermodynamic strength as an oxidant in basic solutions and its kinetic reaction rate in acidic solutions.\n\n**1. Thermodynamics: Is oxygen a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic solutions?**\n\nThe strength of an oxidizing agent is quantified by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher (more positive) E° value indicates a stronger oxidant because the reduction reaction is more spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable.\n\nLet's examine the standard reduction half-reactions for oxygen in both acidic and basic media.\n\n*   **In acidic solution:**\n    O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +1.23 V**.\n\n*   **In basic solution:**\n    O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +0.40 V**.\n\nComparing the two E° values: +1.23 V (acidic) > +0.40 V (basic).\n\nSince the standard reduction potential of oxygen is significantly higher in acidic solution than in basic solution, oxygen is a **stronger** oxidant in acidic solution. Conversely, this means oxygen is a thermodynamically **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic ones.\n\nThe first blank should be **weaker**.\n\n**2. Kinetics: Does oxygen react faster or slower in acidic solutions?**\n\nKinetics deals with the rate of a reaction. While thermodynamically favorable (as shown by the high E° of +1.23 V), the reduction of oxygen in acidic solutions is known to be kinetically slow.\n\nThe reaction O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l) involves breaking the strong double bond in the O₂ molecule and the transfer of four electrons. This multi-step process has a very high activation energy, making the reaction proceed very slowly at standard conditions without a catalyst. This is why many metals that are thermodynamically unstable in the presence of acidic water (like zinc or iron) do not corrode instantaneously; the reaction is limited by the slow kinetics of oxygen reduction.\n\nTherefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThe second blank should be **slower**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining our findings:\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThis corresponds to the combination \"weaker - slower\".\n\n<<<D>>>"
