    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure and substituent positions:\n*   The parent ring is benzene.\n*   At position C1, there is an ethoxy group (-OEt).\n*   At position C2, there is a tert-butyl group (-tBu).\n*   At position C3, there is a nitro group (-NO2).\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3-pattern. This is often synthetically challenging to achieve via direct electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of substituents typically favor 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns. This suggests that the synthesis will likely involve a multi-step sequence with blocking groups or functional group interconversions.\n\nLet's analyze the directing effects of the final substituents:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho, para-director (bulky, so para is preferred).\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nWe will now analyze each option to see if it can logically lead to the target molecule in high yield.\n\n**Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\nThis sequence is syntactically flawed (e.g., two step 'iv's') and chemically illogical. For example, step iv) is `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), which requires an aniline (an -NH2 group). The preceding steps do not produce an aniline. Step viii) `Fe/HCl` (reduction of a nitro group to an aniline) appears much too late in the sequence. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   **Step i & ii**: Benzene is nitrated to nitrobenzene, then reduced to aniline (`Fe/HCl`).\n*   **Step iii**: Aniline is reacted with `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The lone pair on the nitrogen of aniline coordinates strongly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This complexation deactivates the ring and converts the amino group into a meta-director. Thus, the major product would be **m-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   **Step iv**: Nitration of m-tert-butylaniline. The product has NH2 at C1 and tBu at C3. Under the strongly acidic nitrating conditions, the NH2 group is protonated to -NH3+, which is a meta-director (directs to C5). The tBu group at C3 is an ortho,para-director (directs to C2, C4, C6). The directing effects are conflicting, and the desired product (`2-nitro-3-tert-butylaniline`) would not be formed in high yield, if at all. Therefore, Option B is an incorrect pathway.\n\n**Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   **Step i**: Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **Step ii**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The t-butyl group is an ortho,para-director, but it is very bulky. This steric hindrance means the major product is overwhelmingly **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**, with the desired **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** being a minor product. A route that starts with a low-yield step cannot be a \"high-yield synthesis\".\n*   Even if we proceed with the minor ortho-isomer, the subsequent nitration of the corresponding aniline (step iv) would be regiochemically difficult, similar to the problem in Option B. Therefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\nThis sequence appears the most complex, which is often necessary for challenging substitution patterns. Let's analyze its strategy.\n*   **Step i**: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **Step ii**: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky t-butyl group directs the incoming sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`) to the sterically accessible para-position. This gives **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a classic example of using a **blocking group**.\n*   **Step iii**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Now the para-position is blocked. The t-butyl group (at C1) is an o,p-director, and the sulfonic acid group (at C4) is a meta-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions: C2 and C6. This forces nitration to occur ortho to the tert-butyl group. This is a high-yield method to produce **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This intermediate has the t-butyl group and the nitro group ortho to each other, a key feature of the target molecule.\n*   **The Problem**: The subsequent steps listed (iv to ix) seem to contain a perplexing or erroneous step (`vi) HNO3/H2SO4` applied to a diazonium salt) and if interpreted literally, do not lead to the final product. For instance, a plausible continuation would be to remove the blocking group (desulfonation with steam/dilute acid), which would yield o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. However, introducing the ethoxy group at the correct position from this intermediate is not straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion by Elimination**\n\nOptions B, C, and D are fundamentally flawed due to incorrect predictions of regioselectivity based on well-established principles of electrophilic substitution.\n*   B fails at the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline.\n*   C fails because the initial nitration step is not regioselective for the required isomer in high yield.\n*   D is in an illogical order.\n\nOption A employs a correct and sophisticated strategy (para-blocking with a sulfonic acid group) to achieve the difficult ortho-nitration in high yield. Although the rest of the sequence as written is confusing and likely contains an error, the initial strategy is the only one presented that can lead towards the desired 1,2-disubstituted pattern (ortho-nitro-tert-butyl) in a controlled, high-yield manner. In the context of a multiple-choice question where other options are clearly incorrect, Option A represents the best synthetic strategy, assuming a typo or a complex, non-obvious transformation in the later steps.\n\n<<<A>>>"
