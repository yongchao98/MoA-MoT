    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product and the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, acetic anhydride, heating.\n*   This set of reagents performs an alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction will substitute a bromine atom for a hydrogen atom on the carbon alpha to the carboxyl group.\n*   The alpha-carbon in acetic acid is the methyl (CH3) group.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, Br-CH2-COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with heating.\n*   This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   The cyanide ion (CN-) is a strong nucleophile, and the bromoacetate has a primary alkyl halide, which is an excellent substrate for an SN2 reaction. The cyanide ion will displace the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH), followed by 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   This is a two-step alkylation process.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes the most acidic proton. The protons on the carbon between the cyano group (-CN) and the ester group (-COOEt) are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because the resulting negative charge (carbanion) is stabilized by resonance with both groups. NaH deprotonates this carbon to form an enolate.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]- Na+ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the primary carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that *excess* NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the intermediate formed above. The remaining proton on the alpha-carbon is still acidic and will be removed by NaH.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]- Na+ + H2\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion on the alpha-carbon now attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo count the number of signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** A 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane with two different substituents is **achiral**. Although individual chair conformations are chiral, they rapidly interconvert into their mirror images at room temperature. The time-averaged structure is achiral and possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and the opposite carbon, C4.\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:**\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes carbon C2 equivalent to C6.\n    *   It also makes carbon C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   Carbons C1 and C4 are unique and lie on the plane of symmetry.\n\nNow, let's count the chemically distinct hydrogens based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **Ethoxy Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   **-CH2- protons:** The molecule is achiral. The two protons on this methylene group are enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. (1 signal)\n    *   **-CH3- protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. (1 signal)\n    *   Total from ethyl group = **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:** We have three distinct sets of methylene (-CH2-) groups to consider: the C2/C6 pair, the C3/C5 pair, and the unique C4.\n    *   **C2/C6 protons:** Let's look at the two protons on C2. In any chair conformation, one is axial and one is equatorial. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1 and are not interchangeable by the symmetry plane. Therefore, they are diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. This gives 2 distinct signals for the protons at the C2 and C6 positions. (2 signals)\n    *   **C3/C5 protons:** Similar to the C2/C6 protons, the two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic. They are chemically distinct. This gives another 2 distinct signals for the protons at the C3 and C5 positions. (2 signals)\n    *   **C4 protons:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons attached to it (one axial, one equatorial) are not interchanged by this plane. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the ring and the substituents on C1. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. (2 signals)\n    *   Total from the cyclohexane ring = 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **6 signals**.\n\n**Total Signals:**\n*   Adding the signals from the ethoxy group and the cyclohexane ring:\n*   Total = 2 (ethoxy) + 6 (ring) = **8 signals**.\n\nThe 8 distinct types of hydrogens are:\n1.  -O-C**H**2-CH3 (2H)\n2.  -O-CH2-C**H**3 (3H)\n3.  Axial-like H on C2/C6 (2H)\n4.  Equatorial-like H on C2/C6 (2H)\n5.  Axial-like H on C3/C5 (2H)\n6.  Equatorial-like H on C3/C5 (2H)\n7.  Axial-like H on C4 (1H)\n8.  Equatorial-like H on C4 (1H)\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
