    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are asked to compare the magnitude of two energy values:\n1.  **The paramagnetic coupling energy ($\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$)**: This is the energy shift of an atomic state due to the interaction of the electron's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. This is a manifestation of the Zeeman effect.\n2.  **The transition energy ($\\Delta E$)**: This is the energy difference between two atomic levels in a Hydrogen atom, corresponding to a specific spectral line with a given wavelength.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$)\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic interaction is given by:\n$$ H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B} $$\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic moment of the electron and $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$$ \\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} $$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the mass of the electron.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian, we get:\n$$ H = \\left(-\\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} $$\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$. The dot product simplifies to:\n$$ H = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} L_z $$\nwhere $L_z$ is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum operator.\n\nThe expectation value of this Hamiltonian, which represents the energy shift, is:\n$$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{eB}{2m_e} L_z \\right\\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} \\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle $$\nThe eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Thus, $\\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle = m\\hbar$.\n$$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} m\\hbar = m \\left( \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\right) B $$\nThe term in the parenthesis is the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$:\n$$ \\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T} $$\nSo, the paramagnetic coupling energy is:\n$$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B $$\nThe problem specifies \"small values of m\". Let's consider a typical small, non-zero value, $m=1$. The magnetic field is given as $B=1$ T.\n$$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV} $$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)\n\nThe transition energy $\\Delta E$ corresponds to the emission of a photon with a given wavelength $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$. This wavelength belongs to the Balmer series of the Hydrogen atom ($n_{final}=2$, $n_{initial}=4$), corresponding to the H-beta line.\n\nThe energy of a photon is given by the formula:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\nwhere:\n-   $h$ is the Planck constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J路s or $4.136 \\times 10^{-15}$ eV路s)\n-   $c$ is the speed of light ($3 \\times 10^8$ m/s)\n-   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength ($0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}$ m)\n\nFor easier calculation, we can use the value $hc \\approx 1240$ eV路nm.\n$$ \\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\text{ nm} $$\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV路nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.551 \\text{ eV} $$\n\n### 4. Comparing the Magnitudes\n\nNow we compare the two energy values:\n-   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n-   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.551 \\text{ eV}$\n\nTo compare their orders of magnitude, we can calculate their ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.551 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nThis ratio is very small, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is significantly smaller than the transition energy.\n$$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E $$\n\nThis result is expected, as the Zeeman splitting is a fine perturbation to the atomic energy levels, which are on the order of electron-volts (eV). The energy shifts due to typical laboratory magnetic fields (around 1 T) are in the range of micro-electron-volts ($\\mu$eV).\n\n<<<C>>>"
