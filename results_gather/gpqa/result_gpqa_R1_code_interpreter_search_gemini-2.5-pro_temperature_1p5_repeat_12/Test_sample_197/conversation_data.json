    "This problem requires calculating the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], in a solution with a given total cobalt concentration and thiocyanate concentration. The mole fraction (α₂) of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex represents the ratio of its concentration to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\nThe formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes can be described by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ; β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ; β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all the complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the definitions of the stability constants, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the free thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for total cobalt concentration gives:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, α₂, is given by:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nSubstituting the expressions from above:\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leaving:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe are given that the total thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, and the total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M (or 0.01 M). Since the thiocyanate concentration is in 10-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration, we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻] to be equal to its total concentration, 0.1 M.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values to calculate α₂:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe denominator is the sum of these terms:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)₂] complex:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow we can calculate α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_complex_percentage():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given stability constants\n    beta1 = 9\n    beta2 = 40\n    beta3 = 63\n    beta4 = 16\n\n    # Given thiocyanate concentration (assumed to be constant)\n    scn_conc = 0.1\n\n    # Calculate the denominator of the mole fraction equation.\n    # The sum of terms for all species: Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]-, [Co(SCN)4]2-\n    # The term for Co^2+ (beta_0) is 1.\n    denominator = 1 + beta1 * scn_conc**1 + beta2 * scn_conc**2 + beta3 * scn_conc**3 + beta4 * scn_conc**4\n\n    # Calculate the numerator for the [Co(SCN)2] complex\n    numerator_2 = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n    # Calculate the mole fraction (alpha_2)\n    alpha_2 = numerator_2 / denominator\n\n    # Convert the fraction to a percentage\n    percentage = alpha_2 * 100\n    \n    print(percentage)\n\ncalculate_complex_percentage()\n```\n\n16.916180326482278\n\nThe calculation shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires calculating the percentage of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or [Co(SCN)₂], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This percentage is equivalent to the mole fraction of the complex, α₂.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nIn the solution, free cobalt ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes: [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻. The formation of these complexes is governed by their overall stability constants (β):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ; β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ; β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = 16\n\n**2. Formulate the Mole Fraction Equation**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all the complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]`\n\nUsing the definitions of the stability constants, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the free ligand (thiocyanate) concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n`[Co(SCN)ₙ] = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n\nSubstituting these into the total concentration equation gives:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (α₂) is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the equation for the mole fraction:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Apply the Given Values and Assumptions**\n\nWe are given:\n*   [SCN⁻] (total) = 0.1 M\n*   c(Co) (total) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n*   β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n\nSince the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate consumed to form complexes is relatively small. Therefore, we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻], as being equal to its total concentration:\n`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nNow we can plug the values into the mole fraction equation:\n\n*   **Numerator**: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator**: `1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴`\n    *   `β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9`\n    *   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n    *   **Denominator Sum**: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂)**: `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe python code confirms this calculation. The output `16.916180326482287` rounds to 16.9%. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
