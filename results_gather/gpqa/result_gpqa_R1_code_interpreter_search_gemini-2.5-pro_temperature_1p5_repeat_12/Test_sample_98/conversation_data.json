    "This problem requires identifying an unknown compound from four possibilities using spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid, where the peak is significantly broadened due to hydrogen bonding. The typical range is very wide, from 2500 cm⁻¹ to 3300 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. For a carboxylic acid, this peak usually appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The presence of both a broad O-H and a strong C=O peak in these regions is a classic signature of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four given options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group type but does not help distinguish between the candidates.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four candidate structures are saturated, consistent with this information.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).**\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).**\n\nThese complex splitting patterns are the key to solving the problem. They arise when a proton (or a set of equivalent protons) is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons. The multiplicity is determined by the (n+1) rule, applied multiplicatively for each non-equivalent neighbor.\n\n*   A **doublet (d)** means coupling to 1 neighboring proton.\n*   A **triplet (t)** means coupling to 2 neighboring protons (e.g., a -CH2- group).\n*   A **quartet (q)** means coupling to 3 neighboring protons (e.g., a -CH3 group).\n\nTherefore:\n*   **dtq:** A proton coupled to one proton (d), a CH2 group (t), and a CH3 group (q).\n*   **dtt:** A proton coupled to one proton (d) and two different CH2 groups (t and t).\n\nThese patterns are typically found at methine (-CH-) protons, especially those that are chiral centers, as they are often coupled to many different groups. We need to examine the structure of each candidate to see which one would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each candidate structure\n\nLet's analyze the structure corresponding to each option, paying close attention to the methine protons (`-CH-`) on the main carbon chain. We will number the carbons starting from the COOH group as C1.\n\n**A) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH -> 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n` (CH3)2(d) - CH(c) - CH(b)(CH3)e - CH2(a) - COOH `\n*   **H(b) on C3:** Coupled to `CH2(a)` (2H -> t), `H(c)` (1H -> d), and `CH3(e)` (3H -> q). The signal for H(b) would be a **tdq** (or dtq). This matches one of the signals.\n*   **H(c) on C4:** Coupled to `H(b)` (1H -> d) and the two equivalent `CH3(d)` groups (6H -> septet). The signal for H(c) would be a **doublet of septets (d-sept)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Molecule A has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH -> 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n` CH3(d)-CH2(c) - CH(b)(Et) - CH(a)(Et) - COOH `\n*   **H(a) on C2:** Coupled to `H(b)` (1H -> d) and the `CH2` of its ethyl group (2H -> t). Signal: **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   **H(b) on C3:** Coupled to `H(a)` (1H -> d), `CH2(c)` (2H -> t), and the `CH2` of its ethyl group (2H -> t). Signal: **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Conclusion:** Molecule B has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\n**C) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH -> 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n` CH3(d) - CH(c)(Et) - CH(b)(Et) - CH2(a) - COOH `\n*   **H(b) on C3:** This proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: `H(c)` (1 proton), `CH2(a)` (2 protons), and the `CH2` of the ethyl group at C3 (2 protons).\n    *   Coupling to `H(c)` (1H) gives a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   Coupling to `CH2(a)` (2H) gives a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   Coupling to the ethyl `CH2` (2H) gives another **triplet (t)**.\n    *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches signal 2.\n*   **H(c) on C4:** This proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: `H(b)` (1 proton), `CH3(d)` (3 protons), and the `CH2` of the ethyl group at C4 (2 protons).\n    *   Coupling to `H(b)` (1H) gives a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   Coupling to the ethyl `CH2` (2H) gives a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   Coupling to `CH3(d)` (3H) gives a **quartet (q)**.\n    *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches signal 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** Molecule C is the only candidate that exhibits both a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal.\n\n**D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH -> 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n` CH3(f)-CH2(e) - CH(c)(CH3)d - CH(a)(CH3)b - COOH `\n*   **H(a) on C2:** Coupled to `H(c)` (1H -> d) and `CH3(b)` (3H -> q). Signal: **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n*   **H(c) on C3:** Coupled to `H(a)` (1H -> d), `CH2(e)` (2H -> t), and `CH3(d)` (3H -> q). Signal: **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Molecule D has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the predicted 1H NMR splitting patterns for the methine protons in each candidate molecule, we find that only molecule C, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, would produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).\n\n<<<C>>>"
