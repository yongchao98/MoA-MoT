    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:** The core principle we'll use is the conservation of total energy. For a relativistic system with a potential energy field, the total conserved energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Energy:** The total relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. This energy includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($(\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n\n3.  **Potential Energy:** The harmonic oscillator is subject to Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy associated with this force is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n4.  **Total Conserved Energy of the System:** The total energy of the oscillator system at any point in its motion is:\n    $E_{total} = E_{particle} + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n5.  **Analyze Two Key Points in the Oscillation:** We can find the value of this conserved total energy by evaluating it at a point where we know all the variables. We will then use this value to find the unknown ($v_{max}$) at another point.\n\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum Amplitude (Turning Point)**\n        At the maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction.\n        *   Position: $x = A$\n        *   Velocity: $v = 0$\n        *   Lorentz Factor: Since $v=0$, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        *   Potential Energy: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   Total Energy at this point: $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position**\n        At the equilibrium position, $x=0$, the potential energy is zero, and the speed is at its maximum.\n        *   Position: $x = 0$\n        *   Velocity: $v = v_{max}$\n        *   Lorentz Factor: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   Potential Energy: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        *   Total Energy at this point: $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$.\n\n6.  **Equate the Energies and Solve:** Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the turning point must be equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve this equation for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n7.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:** We have an expression for $\\gamma_{max}$, and we also know its definition in terms of $v_{max}$. We can now solve for $v_{max}$.\n    From the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Let's rearrange to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}\\right)$\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n8.  **Substitute the Expression for $\\gamma_{max}$:** Finally, we substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ we found in step 6 into the equation from step 7.\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** This result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
