    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n\nThe problem requires us to compare two different astronomical phenomena that both cause a periodic dimming of a star's light as observed from Earth:\n*   **Stellar Rotation with Spots:** A star has a cool, dark spot on its surface. As the star rotates, the spot comes into view and then disappears, causing the star's total brightness to decrease and then increase.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** A planet passes in front of its star from our point of view. This blocks a small fraction of the star's light, causing a temporary dip in brightness.\n\nThe goal is to find the size of a hypothetical planet that would block the same amount of light as the decrease caused by the star spots.\n\n**2. Quantify the Brightness Variation due to Spots**\n\n*   **Luminosity and Temperature:** The amount of energy (and thus light) emitted by a patch of a star's surface is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the flux (F) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (T): `F ∝ T⁴`.\n*   **Model Setup:**\n    *   We assume we are viewing the star equator-on, such that we see the full effect of the rotational modulation.\n    *   **Maximum Brightness ($F_{max}$):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is fully facing the observer. The entire visible disk of the star is at the effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`. The total flux is proportional to `T_eff⁴`.\n    *   **Minimum Brightness ($F_{min}$):** This occurs when the spotty hemisphere is fully facing the observer. This hemisphere has a filling factor (`f`) of 20% (or 0.2) for spots. This means 20% of the visible disk's area is covered by spots, and the remaining 80% is the normal photosphere.\n        *   The spot temperature is `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n        *   The flux from this view is a weighted average: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n        *   Plugging in the numbers: `F_min ∝ (1 - 0.2) * 6000⁴ + 0.2 * 5000⁴`.\n*   **Calculate the Signal Amplitude:** The amplitude of the variation is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum brightness.\n    *   `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    *   Substituting the expressions for flux:\n        `Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - [(1-f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\n    *   Simplifying the expression:\n        `Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f*T_eff⁴ - f*T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n        `Amplitude = (f*T_eff⁴ - f*T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n        `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n**3. Quantify the Brightness Drop due to an Exoplanet Transit**\n\n*   An exoplanet transit blocks a portion of the star's light. The amount of light blocked (the transit depth, which is the signal amplitude) is equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   `Transit Depth = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)`\n    *   `Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n**4. Equate the two Amplitudes and Solve**\n\nWe need the signal from the spots to be equal to the signal from the hypothetical planet.\n*   `(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴))`\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Star and spot properties\nT_eff = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\ndelta_T = 1000  # Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin\nf = 0.2  # Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere\n\n# Calculate spot temperature\nT_spot = T_eff - delta_T\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the signal due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\namplitude_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# For an exoplanet transit, the amplitude (transit depth) is (R_pl / R_star)**2\n# We set the two amplitudes equal to each other.\n# (R_pl / R_star)**2 = amplitude_spots\n# R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude_spots)\n\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude_spots)\n\nprint(f\"{relative_radius:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>0.3218\n\nThe calculation shows that the relative radius of the exoplanet `R_pl / R_star` should be approximately 0.3218.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks us to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`Rpl/Rstar`) that would produce the same dip in brightness as a star with one hemisphere covered 20% by dark spots.\n\n**1. Calculate the Brightness Drop from Starspots**\n\nThe brightness or flux (F) emitted by a star's surface is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law: `F ∝ T⁴`.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness ($F_{max}$):** This occurs when the completely unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer.

On this side, a fraction `f = 0.2` (or 20%) of the surface is covered by spots, and the remaining `1 - f = 0.8` is the normal photosphere.\n    *   Star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n    *   Spot temperature, `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The flux is a weighted average of the flux from the normal photosphere and the spots.\n        `F_{min} ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`\n\n*   **Amplitude of the Signal:** The amplitude is the relative change in flux.\n    `Amplitude_spots = (F_{max} - F_{min}) / F_{max}`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = f * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n`Amplitude_spots = 0.2 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spots = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spots = 0.2 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355`\n\nSo, the spots cause a brightness dip of about 10.36%.\n\n**2. Calculate the Brightness Drop from an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The resulting drop in brightness (the transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n*   `Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star`\n*   `Amplitude_planet = (π * Rpl²) / (π * Rstar²)`\n*   `Amplitude_planet = (Rpl / Rstar)²`\n\n**3. Equate the two Amplitudes and Solve for the Planet's Radius**\n\nWe need the amplitude from the planet transit to equal the amplitude from the starspots.\n`(Rpl / Rstar)² = Amplitude_spots`\n`(Rpl / Rstar)² = 0.10355`\n`Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`Rpl / Rstar ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis result means the hypothetical planet would need a radius of about 32.18% of the star's radius to produce the same signal.\n\nComparing our result to the options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
