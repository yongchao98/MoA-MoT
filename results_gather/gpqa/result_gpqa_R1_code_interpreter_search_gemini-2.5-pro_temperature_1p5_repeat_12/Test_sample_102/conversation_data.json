    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) is at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) is at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) is at position 5.\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nWe need to consider the directing effects of each group in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), which is the primary way to add groups to a benzene ring.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃)**: Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂) C**: Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br)**: Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that the synthesis likely relies on the presence of meta-directing groups to guide subsequent substitutions.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies\n\nLet's devise a logical synthesis based on these directing effects and then compare it with the given options. The key is the order in which the three groups are added.\n\n*   **Strategy A: Introduce the acetyl group first.**\n    1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    2.  **Add the second group (e.g., Bromine):** Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to the 3-position.\n    3.  **Add the third group (Nitro):** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's analyze the directing effects in this step:\n        *   The acetyl group at C1 is meta-directing, so it directs the incoming nitro group to C5.\n        *   The bromo group at C3 is ortho,para-directing. It directs the incoming nitro group to positions C2, C4, and C6. The C5 position is *not* favored by bromine's directing effect. However, a position ortho to a halogen is often still reactive enough, and the combined influence is key. Let's consider another permutation.\n\n*   **Strategy B: Introduce acetyl, then nitro, then bromo.**\n    1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The acetyl group directs nitration to the meta position.\n    3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's analyze the directing effects:\n        *   The acetyl group at C1 is a meta-director, directing the incoming bromine to C5.\n        *   The nitro group at C3 is also a meta-director, directing the incoming bromine to C5.\n        *   Since both existing groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) to the same C5 position, this step should be highly regioselective and lead cleanly to the desired product. The only drawback is that the ring is heavily deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups, so the reaction might be slow.\n\n*   **Strategy C (same as A, just swapping Br and NO2 addition order): Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration**\n    1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n        *   The acetyl group at C1 (meta-director) directs nitration to C5.\n        *   The bromo group at C3 (ortho,para-director) directs to C2, C4, and C6. Position 5 is *ortho* to the bromine.\n        *   Here, both groups' directing effects align to favor position 5 (meta to acetyl, ortho to bromo). This is a strong indication that this pathway will give a high yield of the desired product.\n\nBoth strategies B and C seem chemically sound. Let's examine the options to see which one matches.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Given Options\n\nThe options provide a fixed sequence of 7 reactions. We need to find the one that correctly produces the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration); ii) Fe/HCl (Reduction); iii) NaNO₂/HCl (Diazotization); iv) H₃PO₂ (Deamination). This sequence (i to iv) converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This is a futile loop and cannot be correct.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...\n    *   Step i: Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    *   Step ii: Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. (Correct, as per Strategy C).\n    *   Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (TARGET!). (Correct, as per Strategy C).\n    This sequence of the first three steps is precisely Strategy C, which we identified as a high-yield route. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) are nonsensical, as they would take the desired product and transform it into something else. However, compared to the other options, this is the only one that contains a valid synthesis for the target molecule. It is common in such questions that the correct sequence is embedded within a longer, sometimes flawed, list.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence begins by creating aniline, then acetanilide, then introduces bromine and a nitro group. Ultimately, it uses deamination to produce 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. It fails to introduce the acetyl group onto the ring (N-acylation for protection is not the same as C-acylation via Friedel-Crafts on the ring). So, this is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination); ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration). This would produce a mixture of ortho- and para-nitrobromobenzene, with the para isomer (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene) being the major product. The subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on this product would occur ortho to the bromine and meta to the nitro group, i.e., at position 2. This would yield 1-(2-acetyl-4-nitrophenyl)bromine, which is the wrong isomer. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B is the only choice that contains a chemically correct and high-yield pathway to the target molecule, even if the sequence listed is unnecessarily long. The first three steps of Option B represent the most logical synthesis: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration.\n\n<<<B>>>"
