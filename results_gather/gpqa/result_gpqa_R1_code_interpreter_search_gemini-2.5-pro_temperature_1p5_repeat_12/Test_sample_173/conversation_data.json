    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Define Variables and Given Information\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is $p_{initial} = 0$.\n*   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   The more massive fragment is $m_1$.\n*   \"one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other\": This is interpreted as $m_1 = 2m_2$. We choose this interpretation because it leads to one of the given answer options.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n*   The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is $T_1$. We need to find the difference between its correct relativistic value and its classical approximation.\n\n### 2. Calculate Fragment Masses and Energies\nFirst, we solve for the rest-masses of the fragments, $m_1$ and $m_2$, in terms of $M$.\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99M$\n$m_2 = 0.33M$\n\nNow find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n\nNext, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   $m_1c^2 = 0.66(Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_2c^2 = 0.33(Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n### 3. Calculate the Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy)\nThe Q-value of the reaction is the total kinetic energy released, which is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n$Q = T_1 + T_2 = Mc^2 - (m_1 + m_2)c^2$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (0.99M)c^2 = 0.01Mc^2$\n$Q = 0.01 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Relativistic Kinetic Energy ($T_1$)\nWe use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before is $Mc^2$. The total energy after is $E_1 + E_2$. So, $E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial momentum is zero. The final momentum is $\\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 = 0$, which means their magnitudes are equal: $p_1 = p_2$.\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. From this, we have $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$.\nSince $p_1 = p_2$, we can write:\n$E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n\nWe can solve for $E_1$ by substituting $E_2 = Mc^2 - E_1$:\n$E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = (Mc^2 - E_1)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = (Mc^2)^2 - 2(Mc^2)E_1 + E_1^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$- (m_1c^2)^2 = (Mc^2)^2 - 2(Mc^2)E_1 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$2(Mc^2)E_1 = (Mc^2)^2 + (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$E_1 = \\frac{(Mc^2)^2 + (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2}{2(Mc^2)}$\n\nNow, plug in the energy values:\n$E_1 = \\frac{(300)^2 + (198)^2 - (99)^2}{2 \\times 300} = \\frac{90000 + 39204 - 9801}{600} = \\frac{119403}{600} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThe kinetic energy $T_1$ is the total energy $E_1$ minus the rest-mass energy $m_1c^2$:\n$T_1 = E_1 - m_1c^2 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n### 5. Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy ($T_{1,classical}$)\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\nFrom conservation of momentum, $p_1 = p_2$. Let's call this momentum $p$.\n$T_{1,classical} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$\n$T_{2,classical} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$\n\nFrom this, we can see the ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n$\\frac{T_{1,classical}}{T_{2,classical}} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nSo, $T_{2,classical} = 2T_{1,classical}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the Q-value, which we calculated to be 3 GeV:\n$T_{1,classical} + T_{2,classical} = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1,classical} + 2T_{1,classical} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3T_{1,classical} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1,classical} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n### 6. Calculate the Difference\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) $T_1$ value and the classical approximation. To match the units of the options, we convert our energies to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV).\n*   Relativistic $T_1 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Classical $T_{1,classical} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nDifference = $T_1 - T_{1,classical} = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculations.\n```python\n# Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\nMc2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments m1 and m2 in GeV\n# m1 = 2*m2 and m1+m2 = 0.99*M => 3*m2 = 0.99*M\n# m2 = 0.33*M and m1 = 0.66*M\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\n\n# Calculate the total kinetic energy (Q-value) in GeV\nQ_value = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation ---\n# E1 = ( (Mc^2)^2 + (m1c^2)^2 - (m2c^2)^2 ) / (2 * Mc^2)\nE1_relativistic = (Mc2**2 + m1c2**2 - m2c2**2) / (2 * Mc2)\n# The kinetic energy is T1 = E1 - m1c^2\nT1_relativistic = E1_relativistic - m1c2\n\n# --- Classical Calculation ---\n# In the classical approximation, the Q-value is distributed as:\n# T1/T2 = m2/m1 => T1/(Q-T1) = m2/m1 => T1*m1 = (Q-T1)*m2\n# T1 * (m1+m2) = Q*m2 => T1 = Q * m2/(m1+m2)\n# Alternatively, T1 + T2 = Q and T2/T1 = m1/m2 = 2, so T2 = 2*T1\n# T1 + 2*T1 = Q => 3*T1 = Q\nT1_classical = Q_value / 3.0\n\n# --- Difference ---\n# The difference in energies, converted from GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic - T1_classical) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n\n```\nThe code output confirms the result.\n\nRelativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\nClassical T1: 1.000 GeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, so its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy, $E_{initial} = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$, and its initial momentum is $p_{initial} = 0$.\n\nThe nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. Let $m_1$ be the more massive fragment. According to the problem statement, \"one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other,\" so we have:\n$m_1 = 2m_2$\n\nThe sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M:\n$m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nWe can solve for the individual masses in terms of M by substituting the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\nAnd therefore, $m_1 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n\nNext, we calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n$m_1c^2 = 0.66 (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n$m_2c^2 = 0.33 (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy:\n$Q = T_1 + T_2 = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1)**\n\nWe use conservation of energy and momentum.\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy equals the total final energy: $Mc^2 = E_1 + E_2$, where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the total energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of the fragments.\n\nUsing the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, we can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$. Since the momenta are equal:\n$E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\nUsing $E_2 = Mc^2 - E_1$:\n$E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = (Mc^2 - E_1)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = (Mc^2)^2 - 2(Mc^2)E_1 + E_1^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\nSolving for $E_1$:\n$2(Mc^2)E_1 = (Mc^2)^2 + (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$E_1 = \\frac{(Mc^2)^2 + (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2}{2(Mc^2)}$\nPlugging in the values:\n$E_1 = \\frac{(300)^2 + (198)^2 - (99)^2}{2 \\times 300} = \\frac{90000 + 39204 - 9801}{600} = \\frac{119403}{600} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$\nThe kinetic energy $T_1$ is the total energy minus the rest energy:\n$T_1 = E_1 - m_1c^2 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Classical (Non-relativistic) Kinetic Energy (T1)**\n\nIn the classical approximation, from the conservation of momentum ($p_1 = p_2$), the kinetic energies are shared in inverse proportion to the masses:\n$T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nSo, $T_2 = 2T_1$.\nThe total kinetic energy is the Q-value, $Q = 3$ GeV:\n$T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies T_1 = 1 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = $T_{1,relativistic} - T_{1,classical} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$\nThe options are given in MeV, so we convert GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\nDifference = $0.005 \\text{ GeV} \\times 1000 \\frac{\\text{MeV}}{\\text{GeV}} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n<<<C>>>"
