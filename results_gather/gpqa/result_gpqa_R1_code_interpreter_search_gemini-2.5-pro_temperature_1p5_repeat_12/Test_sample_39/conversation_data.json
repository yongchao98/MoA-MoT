    "This is a common colloquialism used by organic chemists. Let's break down why.\n\n1.  **Context:** The setting is a synthetic organic chemistry lab. A primary activity in such a lab, after running a reaction, is to purify the desired product from byproducts, unreacted starting materials, and other impurities.\n\n2.  **Purification Techniques:** The most common and versatile purification technique used in a modern synthetic organic lab is **chromatography**, especially Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) for analysis and column chromatography for preparative separation.\n\n3.  **How Chromatography Works:** Chromatography separates compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (e.g., silica gel, which is polar) and a mobile phase (a solvent or mixture of solvents, the \"eluent\"). In the simplest and most common case (normal-phase chromatography), less polar compounds travel faster up a TLC plate or down a column, while more polar compounds are retained longer by the polar stationary phase and move more slowly. The \"separation\" is based on these differences in speed.\n\n4.  **Interpreting the Phrase:** When a chemist runs a TLC plate to check their reaction mixture, the separated compounds appear as distinct spots at different heights. If two compounds have very **similar polarities**, they will travel at nearly the same speed. On the TLC plate, their spots will be very close together or even completely overlappingâ€”literally looking like they are **\"on top of each other\"**. Similarly, when running a column, these compounds will elute from the column at the same time, making it impossible to separate them.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property used to characterize a purified chiral compound. It's not a separation technique, so this is an incorrect interpretation.\n    *   **B) Similar boiling points:** While compounds with similar boiling points are difficult to separate by distillation, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more commonly used to describe the visual result of a failed chromatographic separation (e.g., on a TLC plate) than a failed distillation.\n    *   **C) Similar polarities:** This is the most likely meaning. As explained above, similar polarities lead directly to poor separation in chromatography, the most common purification method. The visual result on a TLC plate is spots that are \"on top of each other.\" This is the direct cause of the chemist's frustration.\n    *   **D) Bonding through non-covalent interactions:** This is a statement of fundamental chemistry, explaining *why* polarity affects separation. The difference in the strength of these interactions with the stationary phase is what allows chromatography to work. However, the chemist is describing the *result* of a failed experiment (poor separation), not the underlying physical principle. The direct experimental property causing the failure is the similarity in polarity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a very common way for an organic chemist to complain that they cannot separate their product from an impurity using chromatography, because the compounds have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
