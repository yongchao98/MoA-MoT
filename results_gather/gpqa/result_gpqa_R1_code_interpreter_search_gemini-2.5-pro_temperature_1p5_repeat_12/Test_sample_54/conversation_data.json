    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the total number of protons.**\n    The integration values for the signals are 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\n    The total number of protons in the molecule is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the molecular formula from the options.**\n    Let's check the number of protons for the given options:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3) has the formula C5H8O2. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8. This matches our data.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (CH3-CH2-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3) has the formula C6H10O2. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 10. This does not match our data.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate, not a butenyl acetate. This eliminates options B) Trans-butenyl acetate and C) Cis-butenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Differentiate between Cis and Trans isomers.**\n    We are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to differentiating between these two stereoisomers lies in the coupling constant (J-value) of the two protons on the carbon-carbon double bond (the vinyl protons).\n    *   The provided data includes a signal at 7.0 ppm which is a doublet (d) with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This signal corresponds to one of the vinyl protons being split by the other vinyl proton.\n    *   In 1H NMR spectroscopy, the magnitude of the coupling constant between two vicinal protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their stereochemistry:\n        *   **Trans-coupling (³J_trans)** is typically large, falling in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   **Cis-coupling (³J_cis)** is significantly smaller, falling in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   The observed coupling constant of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n*   **Step 4: Assign all signals to the proposed structure (Trans-propenyl acetate).**\n    Let's check if all the data fits the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate: CH3(c)-CH(a)=CH(b)-O-CO-CH3(d)\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal corresponds to the methyl protons of the acetate group, CH3(d). They are not coupled to any other protons, hence they appear as a singlet. This is a characteristic chemical shift for an acetate methyl.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is one of the vinyl protons, H(b). It is deshielded (has a higher ppm value) because it is attached to the carbon that is bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom. It is split into a doublet by the other vinyl proton, H(a), with a large trans-coupling constant.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinyl proton, H(a). It is split into a doublet by H(b) (J ≈ 16 Hz) and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group, CH3(c). Therefore, its multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal corresponds to the methyl group attached to the double bond, CH3(c). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton, H(a).\n\nAll the provided 1H NMR data are perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
