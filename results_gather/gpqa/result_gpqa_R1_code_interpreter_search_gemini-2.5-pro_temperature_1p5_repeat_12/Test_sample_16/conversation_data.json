    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant chemical equilibrium.**\n    The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is represented by the chemical formula $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. The complex dissociates into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and the EDTA ligand ($EDTA^{4-}$). The equilibrium reaction is:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Understand the given equilibrium constant.**\n    The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the formation of the complex:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    We start with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium.\n\n| Species              | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| -------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$            | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$          | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n4.  **Use the equilibrium constant expression to solve for x.**\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Apply a simplifying assumption.**\n    The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is extremely large. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, meaning very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the approximation that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n6.  **Solve the simplified equation.**\n    The expression becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Finally, solve for x by taking the square root:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n\nTo compute this value precisely, a python script can be used.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # M\n\n# Formation constant (Kf)\nKf = 5e10\n\n# From the simplified equilibrium expression, x^2 = initial_complex_conc / Kf\n# x represents the concentration of Ca^2+ ions at equilibrium.\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / Kf\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\nExecution successful:\n```\n6.32e-07\n```\n\n7.  **Final Interpretation.**\n    The calculated value for x is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. According to our ICE table, x represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    This value is very close to option D. The slight difference is likely due to rounding in the option.\n\n    We can also verify our initial assumption: $x \\ll 0.02$. Indeed, $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ is much smaller than $0.02$, so the assumption was valid.\n\n<<<D>>>",
