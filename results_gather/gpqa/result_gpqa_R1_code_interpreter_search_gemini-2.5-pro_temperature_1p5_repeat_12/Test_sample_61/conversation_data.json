    "This problem requires us to find the correct multi-step synthesis route from ethynylcyclohexane to 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and the Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. Its structure is a cyclohexane ring attached to an acetylene group (-C≡CH). Let's denote the cyclohexyl group as 'Cy'. So, the structure is Cy-C≡CH.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's dissect the name to understand the structure:\n    *   The parent molecule is \"cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\", which is a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached. Structure: Cy-CHO.\n    *   At position 1 of the cyclohexane ring (the same carbon atom where the -CHO is attached), there is a substituent group: \"(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)\".\n    *   This substituent group is -CH(OH)-Cy.\n    *   Putting it all together, the final product has a cyclohexane ring where one carbon atom is attached to both a -CHO group and a -CH(OH)-Cy group.\n\n**2. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Thinking backwards from the product)**\n\nThe final product is an α-hydroxy-aldehyde, which is a characteristic product of an aldol addition reaction.\nThe structure is: Cy¹-C(CHO)-CH(OH)-Cy².\nLet's identify the bond formed in the aldol reaction. It's the bond between the α-carbon of one aldehyde and the carbonyl carbon of the other. In our product, this is the bond between the C1 of the Cy¹ ring and the -CH(OH) carbon.\n\nLet's break this bond:\nCy¹-C(CHO)-CH(OH)-Cy²  =>  [Cy¹-C(CHO)]⁻ (the enolate) + O=CH-Cy² (the aldehyde)\n\nThis shows that the product is formed from the reaction of two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO). One molecule forms an enolate by losing a proton from the α-carbon (C1 of the ring), and this enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This is a self-aldol addition reaction.\n\nReaction: 2 * Cy-CHO  ---(base, e.g., Ba(OH)2)---> Cy-C(CHO)(CH(OH)-Cy)\n\nSo, the last step of the synthesis must be the base-catalyzed aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**3. Forward Synthesis (Connecting the starting material to the intermediate)**\n\nNow, we need to figure out how to synthesize cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO) from ethynylcyclohexane (Cy-C≡CH).\n\n*   The starting material has the carbon skeleton Cy-C-C.\n*   The required intermediate has the carbon skeleton Cy-C.\n\nWe need to remove one carbon atom. A common way to cleave carbon-carbon bonds and introduce aldehyde groups is through ozonolysis of an alkene.\nIf we have an alkene of the form Cy-CH=CH-R, ozonolysis (O₃) followed by a reductive workup (e.g., with (CH₃)₂S or Zn/H₂O) will cleave the double bond and yield two aldehydes: Cy-CHO and R-CHO.\n\nTo get Cy-CHO, we can choose a simple group for R, like a methyl group (CH₃). So, we need to prepare the alkene Cy-CH=CH-CH₃.\n\nHow can we get Cy-CH=CH-CH₃ from our starting material, Cy-C≡CH?\nThis can be achieved in two steps:\n1.  **Alkylation:** First, we need to add a methyl group to the alkyne. Terminal alkynes are acidic and can be deprotonated by a strong base like sodium amide (NaNH₂). The resulting acetylide anion (Cy-C≡C⁻) is a strong nucleophile and can react with an alkyl halide like methyl chloride (CH₃Cl) to form a new C-C bond.\n    *   Cy-C≡CH + NaNH₂ → Cy-C≡C⁻ Na⁺\n    *   Cy-C≡C⁻ Na⁺ + CH₃Cl → Cy-C≡C-CH₃ (1-cyclohexylpropyne)\n\n2.  **Partial Reduction:** Next, we need to reduce the internal alkyne (Cy-C≡C-CH₃) to an alkene (Cy-CH=CH-CH₃). We need to stop the reduction at the alkene stage. This is achieved using a \"poisoned\" catalyst like Lindlar's catalyst (H₂/Pd-CaCO₃). This catalyst specifically performs a syn-addition of hydrogen, leading to the Z-alkene ((Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene).\n    *   Cy-C≡C-CH₃ + H₂/Lindlar's catalyst → (Z)-Cy-CH=CH-CH₃\n\n**4. Assembling the Full Synthesis and Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's combine all the steps into a complete sequence:\n\n1.  **Alkylation:** Cy-C≡CH + NaNH₂ + CH₃Cl → Cy-C≡C-CH₃\n2.  **Partial Reduction:** Cy-C≡C-CH₃ + H₂/Pd-CaCO₃ → (Z)-Cy-CH=CH-CH₃\n3.  **Ozonolysis:** (Z)-Cy-CH=CH-CH₃ + O₃; then (CH₃)₂S → Cy-CHO + CH₃CHO\n4.  **Aldol Addition:** 2 Cy-CHO + Ba(OH)₂ → 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\n\nNow, let's compare this sequence with the given options.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    This sequence perfectly matches our derived synthetic route. It will produce cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol reaction to form the target product. Although a mixture of aldol products would form (due to the presence of acetaldehyde), this route successfully synthesizes the desired molecule.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   Step 1 uses ethyl chloride, which would lead to Cy-C≡C-CH₂CH₃.\n    *   Step 2 is a dissolving metal reduction, giving the E-alkene.\n    *   Step 3 uses oxidative workup (H₂O can lead to H₂O₂ in ozonolysis), which would form carboxylic acids (Cy-COOH), not the aldehyde. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   Step 2 uses H₂/Pd, which is a strong reducing agent that would reduce the alkyne completely to an alkane (Cy-CH₂CH₂CH₃). The subsequent steps would not work.\n    *   The numbering and order of reagents are also illogical. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   Step 1 uses methanol (CH₃OH) after NaNH₂. The acetylide ion formed is a very strong base and would simply deprotonate methanol, regenerating the starting alkyne. Methanol is not an alkylating agent. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, option A is the only chemically correct and logical sequence to synthesize the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>"
