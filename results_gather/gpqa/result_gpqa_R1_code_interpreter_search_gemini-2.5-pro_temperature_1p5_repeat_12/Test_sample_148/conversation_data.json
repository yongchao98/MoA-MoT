    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data:**\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   These peaks have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   The total integral for both peaks is 1H, and their individual integrals are roughly equal (implying a ~1:1 ratio of the species they represent).\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is explicitly ruled out as the cause.\n    *   **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):**\n        *   The analysis shows two distinct peaks in the chromatogram (the LC part).\n        *   These peaks have equal intensities, again confirming the ~1:1 ratio.\n        *   Both peaks have the identical mass spectrum (the MS part).\n        *   This mass spectrum matches the expected mass of the target peptide.\n        *   The analysis was performed at an \"elevated temperature,\" and the peaks remained separate.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the possible explanations (the options provided):**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor would be a different chemical molecule used in an earlier step of the synthesis. It would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and therefore a different mass spectrum. The observation that both LC peaks have the *same mass spectrum* which is *consistent with the expected molecule* makes this option highly unlikely.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral (non-chiral) environment.\n        *   In a standard ¹H NMR experiment (using an achiral solvent), enantiomers are indistinguishable and would produce a single set of peaks, not two.\n        *   Similarly, in a standard LC experiment (using an achiral column), enantiomers co-elute and would produce a single peak, not two.\n        *   Therefore, this explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has two or more stereocenters, and the configuration differs at one or more, but not all, of them.\n        *   Chemical synthesis of peptides (which contain multiple chiral centers) is susceptible to a side reaction called epimerization, where the stereochemistry at one alpha-carbon is inverted (e.g., an L-amino acid becomes a D-amino acid). This creates a diastereomer of the intended peptide.\n        *   Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and different chemical environments.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Because they have different 3D shapes, the corresponding protons in diastereomers are in different chemical environments and are expected to have different chemical shifts. It is entirely plausible for one alpha-proton to show up as two distinct peaks.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties (like polarity), they can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This explains the two peaks in the LC trace. Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and the same molecular weight, which explains why they have identical mass spectra.\n        *   **Consistency with Temperature:** The observation that the peaks are still separate at elevated temperature confirms that they are stable, configurationally distinct molecules (diastereomers) and not just conformers (like rotamers), which would interconvert rapidly at high temperatures and merge into a single peak.\n        *   This explanation fits all the provided data perfectly.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This term is not standard, but it implies a side reaction where a reagent has added twice. This would fundamentally change the chemical structure and molecular formula of the product. The resulting molecule would have a different molecular weight and therefore a different mass spectrum than the expected product. This contradicts the mass spectrometry data.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only explanation that is fully consistent with all observations—two peaks in NMR for the same proton, two peaks in LC, and identical mass spectra for both peaks corresponding to the target molecule—is the presence of a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
