    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This assumption allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to describe the population of atomic energy levels.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (`N`) in two different energy states (`i` and `j`). Let's consider the ground state (level 1) and the specific excited state (level 2).\n    The ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (`N_2`) to the number of atoms in the ground state (`N_1`) is given by:\n    `N_2 / N_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp[-(E_2 - E_1) / (k * T)]`\n    where:\n    *   `g_2` and `g_1` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_2 - E_1` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to both stars:**\n    *   For `star_1` with temperature `T_1`:\n        `(N_2 / N_1)_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]`\n    *   For `star_2` with temperature `T_2`:\n        `(N_2 / N_1)_2 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n    The statistical weights (`g_1`, `g_2`) and the energy difference (`ΔE`) are properties of the iron atom's energy levels, so they are the same for both stars.\n\n4.  **Interpret the observational data:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". In the context of stellar atmospheres, \"excitation\" refers to the population of higher energy levels. The most direct interpretation is that the ratio of excited atoms to ground-state atoms in `star_1` is twice that in `star_2`.\n    Mathematically: `(N_2 / N_1)_1 = 2 * (N_2 / N_1)_2`\n\n5.  **Set up the main equation:** Substitute the Boltzmann equations from step 3 into the relationship from step 4:\n    `(g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]`\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term `(g_2 / g_1)` is a common factor on both sides and can be canceled out.\n    `exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n7.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To deal with the exponentials, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides of the equation.\n    `ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)` and `ln(exp(x)) = x`:\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n8.  **Rearrange the terms** to isolate `ln(2)`:\n    `ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n\n9.  **Factor out the common term `(ΔE / k)`:**\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_2 - 1 / T_1)`\n\n10. **Combine the fractions** inside the parenthesis:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n11. **Use the given numerical values:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. We need the value of the Boltzmann constant, `k`.\n    The Boltzmann constant `k` is approximately `1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n    Therefore, the ratio `(ΔE / k)` is:\n    `(ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n    The problem is designed so that this pre-factor is equal to 1.\n\n12. **Final Equation:** Substitute this value back into the equation from step 10:\n    `ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n13. **Compare with the options:** This result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
