    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope:** This immediately brings to mind deuterium (D or ²H), a common heavy isotope of hydrogen used in chemical synthesis.\n    *   **X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W:** This suggests a very reactive substance, like an active metal hydride, reacting with a protic solvent like water.\n    *   **Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons:** Let's analyze potential gases.\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Matches, but He is inert and an unlikely product of a violent reaction.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Protons = 1 (from D) + 1 (from D) = 2. Neutrons = 1 (from D) + 1 (from D) = 2. This is a perfect match and consistent with X containing deuterium. So, **W is D₂**.\n    *   **X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry:** This points towards common deuterated reagents. Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful reducing agent, and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), is also widely used. Let's hypothesize that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **Reaction and Precipitate G:** If X is LiAlD₄, it reacts violently with water. To produce D₂ gas, the source of all the deuterium must be from the reactants. The reaction must be with a deuterated solvent. Let's assume Liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n        *   This reaction is violent, produces D₂ gas, and forms a precipitate. Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but aluminum hydroxide (and its deuterated version) is a gelatinous precipitate. So, **G is Al(OD)₃**. This fits the description.\n    *   **Precipitate G, when heated, releases B, with melting point ~277 K:** Heating a metal hydroxide causes dehydration.\n        *   `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`\n        *   So, substance B is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   The melting point of D₂O is 3.82 °C, which is 273.15 + 3.82 = 276.97 K. This value is extremely close to 277 K. This clue strongly confirms our identifications. **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Reaction with a keto acid:** A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms. Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both functional groups to alcohols.\n        *   `R-C(=O)-COOH` (3 oxygens) + LiAlD₄ --> (after workup) --> `R-CD(OH)-CH₂(OH)` (a diol, with 2 oxygens).\n        *   The product has 2 oxygen atoms, which matches the problem description perfectly.\n\n2.  **Confirm the Identity of Substance X**\n\n    All clues consistently point to Substance X being **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are:\n        *   Lithium (Li), Atomic Number = 3\n        *   Aluminum (Al), Atomic Number = 13\n        *   Hydrogen (H), present as its isotope Deuterium (D), Atomic Number = 1\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   The question further specifies: \"...considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we must account for all the atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula.\n    *   Let's use integer atomic masses for simplicity, which is sufficient for multiple-choice questions.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium (²H or D) atom ≈ 2 amu.\n        *   Mass of one Aluminum (²⁷Al) atom ≈ 27 amu.\n    *   In one formula unit of LiAlD₄, there are:\n        *   4 atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium).\n        *   1 atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum).\n    *   Now, we sum the masses as instructed:\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8\n        *   Cumulative (total) mass = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
