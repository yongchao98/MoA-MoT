    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH, high temperature (240°C).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reaction of a dihalide with a strong base at high temperature. While direct substitution (S_N1) to a diol or elimination (E2) to a bridgehead alkene (violating Bredt's rule) are possibilities, such harsh conditions on a caged system often lead to skeletal rearrangements.\n*   **Spectral Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone in a strained ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Shows signals for 14 protons, which is consistent with a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O (Degrees of Unsaturation = (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4). Adamantane's tricyclic cage accounts for 3 degrees of unsaturation, and the ketone C=O accounts for the fourth. This confirms the product retains the C₁₀ skeleton and has a ketone functionality.\n*   **Plausible Structure:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes is known to rearrange to the protoadamantane skeleton. The most plausible ketone product is **protoadamantanone** (specifically, tricyclo[4.3.1.0³'⁸]decan-4-one). The provided NMR data, particularly the 4.79 ppm signal, is anomalous for this structure and may be a typo or red herring in the problem statement. However, proceeding with the chemically most logical structure is the key. So, we identify **Product 1 as protoadamantanone**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. However, the subsequent step (ozonolysis) requires Product 2 to be an alkene. The conditions (\"heated with an excess\") suggest that the initially formed alcohol undergoes dehydration. Aluminum isopropoxide, being a Lewis acid, can catalyze this elimination at high temperatures.\n*   **Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** Protoadamantanone is reduced to protoadamantanol.\n    2.  **Dehydration:** Protoadamantanol is dehydrated to form an alkene. Elimination can form a double bond towards C3 or C5. A double bond at C3 would be a bridgehead alkene, violating Bredt's rule and being highly unstable. Therefore, elimination occurs to form the double bond between C4 and C5.\n*   **Plausible Structure:** Product 2 is **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³'⁸]dec-4-ene).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3 and Analyze its ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (an alkene) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups. In this case, since the cleaved carbons (C4 and C5) each bear one hydrogen atom, they will be converted to aldehyde (CHO) groups.\n*   **Structural Transformation:** The cleavage of the C4=C5 bond in the protoadamant-4-ene skeleton opens up one of the rings. This specific transformation is known to yield a derivative of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane.\n*   **Plausible Structure:** Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dicarbaldehyde**. This molecule has a bicyclic core with aldehyde groups at the C2 and C6 positions. Assuming the most stable *cis-exo,exo* conformation, the molecule possesses a C₂ᵥ plane of symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Coupling Pattern**\n\n*   **Target Proton:** We need to find the coupling pattern of the \"most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)\". The exchangeable protons are the acidic aldehyde protons (-CHO), which typically appear at 9-10 ppm. Excluding these, the most deshielded protons will be those on the carbons alpha to the carbonyl groups, which are H2 and H6. Due to the molecule's symmetry, H2 and H6 are chemically equivalent, so we only need to analyze the coupling of one of them, for example, H2.\n*   **Coupling Analysis of H2:** The proton H2 is located on carbon C2. To determine its splitting pattern, we identify the adjacent protons it couples with:\n    1.  The proton on the bridgehead carbon **C1 (H1)**.\n    2.  The two protons on carbon **C3 (H3_axial and H3_equatorial)**.\n*   **Splitting:** H2 is coupled to three neighboring protons (H1, H3_ax, H3_eq). In the rigid bicyclic system, these three protons are not equivalent to each other.\n    *   The coupling to H1 will cause a **doublet** splitting.\n    *   The coupling to the two protons on C3 will cause further splitting. In an ideal scenario, the coupling constant to the axial proton (J_ax,ax) is large, while the coupling constant to the equatorial proton (J_ax,eq) is small. The coupling to the bridgehead proton (H1) is also typically small and may be similar in magnitude to J_ax,eq.\n*   **Resulting Pattern:** The signal for H2 is split by one proton with a large coupling constant (H3_ax) and two protons with smaller, similar coupling constants (H1 and H3_eq). This results in a **doublet of triplets (dt)**. The large coupling to H3_ax splits the signal into a doublet, and each peak of that doublet is further split into a triplet by the two protons H1 and H3_eq which have similar small coupling constants.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
