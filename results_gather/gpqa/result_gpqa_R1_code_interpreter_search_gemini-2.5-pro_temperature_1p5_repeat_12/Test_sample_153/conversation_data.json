    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The intensity ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1.\n*   This 3:1 ratio of M+ to M+2 is a characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl.\n*   Let's check the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The mass would be (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. All four options provided have this molecular formula and are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n*   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ to 2700 cm⁻¹ is observed. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that is hydrogen-bonded in a dimeric form.\n*   A strong, sharp absorption peak is seen at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with the carbonyl of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   Combining these two observations, the IR spectrum strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   Let's evaluate the options based on the IR data:\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate: Does not contain an O-H group. This is inconsistent.\n    *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: Contains a carboxylic acid group. This is consistent.\n    *   C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Contains a phenol -OH and an aldehyde C=O. A phenolic -OH is typically broad, but the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ range is the classic \"hairy beard\" appearance of a carboxylic acid O-H. This option is less likely.\n    *   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Contains a carboxylic acid group. This is consistent.\n*   Based on the IR data, the most likely candidates are B and D.\n\n**3. Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This is a signal in the very downfield region of the spectrum. It is a singlet and integrates to one proton. This is the characteristic chemical shift and multiplicity for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). We see two doublets, each integrating to two protons. This pattern indicates a highly symmetrical aromatic ring. Specifically, this is the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent, as are the two protons on the other side. They couple with their neighbors to form two distinct doublets.\n*   Let's evaluate the remaining candidates (B and D) based on the NMR data:\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). It has a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group at opposite ends of the benzene ring. This symmetry would produce exactly the observed pattern: two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is ortho-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). This substitution pattern removes the symmetry seen in the para isomer. The four protons on the aromatic ring would all be in chemically distinct environments, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four separate signals, likely multiplets), not two simple doublets. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nAll three pieces of spectral evidence point to a single structure. The MS data indicates a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom. The IR data identifies a carboxylic acid functional group. The ¹H NMR data confirms the carboxylic acid and reveals a para-substituted benzene ring structure. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>"
