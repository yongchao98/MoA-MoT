    "This is a classic problem in electrostatics involving a conductor with a cavity. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive point charge $+q$ placed inside the cavity will induce an electric field. Since the electric field inside a conductor must be zero in electrostatic equilibrium, charges within the conductor will redistribute themselves to cancel out this field.\n    *   A total charge of $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface of the spherical cavity. This induced charge $-q$ will distribute itself on the inner surface in such a way that the combined electric field of the point charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$ is zero everywhere outside the cavity but within the conductor material.\n    *   The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain overall charge neutrality, since a charge of $-q$ has accumulated on the inner surface, a corresponding charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a closed conducting shell shields its interior from external electric fields and its exterior from internal electric fields.\n    *   In this case, the conducting material shields the region outside the conductor from the electric field produced by the original charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is determined *solely* by the charge distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface will spread out to reach an equilibrium configuration. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges or fields, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the surface of the large sphere of radius $R$.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at any point outside the shell is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated as a point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical conductor is at a distance $L$ from the point P.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P is given by the formula for a point charge:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{(\\text{Distance from center})^2}$\n\n    Substituting the values:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The position of the cavity ($s$), the position of the charge within the cavity, the radius of the cavity ($r$), and the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect. The external field is simply that of a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conducting sphere.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
