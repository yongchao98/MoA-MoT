    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. It involves the reaction of an enolate (from the ketone) with an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (ethyl acrylate). The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base used to generate the enolate.\n\n2.  **Identify the reactants and their roles:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base will remove an acidic α-proton from this ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is the electrophile that the enolate will attack.\n    *   **Base:** t-BuOK.\n\n3.  **Formation of the enolate:**\n    *   First, we must identify the α-carbons of the ketone (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group, C=O at position 1). These are C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 (C2) is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 (C6) is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since only C6 has a proton, the base t-BuOK can only deprotonate at this position. This forms a single, specific enolate. There is no ambiguity about which enolate is formed (i.e., no kinetic vs. thermodynamic control issue here).\n\n4.  **Nucleophilic attack (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The enolate anion, with the nucleophilic character on C6, attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   In ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), the β-carbon is the CH₂ group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n5.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The initial ketone ring had substituents at C2 (ethyl, methyl) and C6 (methyl).\n    *   After the reaction, a new group, `–CH₂CH₂COOEt`, is attached to C6. Now, C6 is also a quaternary carbon, bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and the new propanoate chain.\n    *   The connectivity of the product is established.\n\n6.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   To name the product systematically according to the options, we treat the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent.\n    *   The chain is `–CH₂(β)CH₂(α)COOEt`. The ring is attached to the C3 of the propanoate (this corresponds to the β-carbon). So the name is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n    *   Now, we name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain is numbered C1 of the substituent ring.\n        *   Our original C6 (point of attachment) becomes the new **C1**. This carbon has a methyl group.\n        *   Our original C1 (the ketone) becomes the new **C2**. This position is `oxo`.\n        *   Our original C2 becomes the new **C3**. This carbon has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent name is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options **A** and **C**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. Protons on the carbon α to a nitro group are acidic and can be removed by a base like KOH to form a stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n\n2.  **Identify the reactants and their roles:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN).\n    *   **Base:** KOH.\n\n3.  **Formation of the nucleophile:**\n    *   The base KOH deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (C1).\n    *   This forms the nucleophilic nitronate anion: `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n4.  **Nucleophilic attack (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   In but-2-enenitrile (CH₃(C4)-CH(C3)=CH(C2)-CN(C1)), the β-carbon relative to the electron-withdrawing nitrile group is C3.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n\n5.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   Let's assemble the fragments after the C-C bond formation and protonation by water:\n        ```\n              NO₂\n              |\n        CH₃CH₂-CH   +   CH₃-CH=CH-CN   --->   CH₃CH₂-CH - CH(CH₃) - CH₂ - CN\n        (from 1-nitropropane) (from but-2-enenitrile)     (Final Product B)\n        ```\n\n6.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (–CN), so the suffix is `-nitrile`.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        `CN(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(CH₃)(C3)-CH(NO₂)(C4)-CH₂(C5)-CH₃(C6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   We identify the substituents and their positions:\n        *   A methyl group (–CH₃) is at C3.\n        *   A nitro group (–NO₂) is at C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options **A** and **D**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The correct name for product **A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   The correct name for product **B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile** (Matches both)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n\nThe only option where both products are correctly named is **A**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
