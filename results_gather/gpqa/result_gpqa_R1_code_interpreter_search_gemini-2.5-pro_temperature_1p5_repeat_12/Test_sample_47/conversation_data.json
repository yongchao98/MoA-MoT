    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone will be brominated at one of the α-carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). Due to the symmetry of cyclohexanone, both α-carbons are equivalent.\n*   The product, **Product 1**, is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a ketone at C1 and a bromine atom at C2.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-haloketone. When treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a characteristic reaction called the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n*   Mechanism:\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion and forming a strained bicyclic intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, leading to the cleavage of the C1-C6 bond. This ring-opening is favored as it relieves the strain of the three-membered ring and forms a more stable carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n    5.  Protonation of the resulting carboxylate during acidic workup (a standard final step in such reactions) yields a carboxylic acid with a five-membered ring.\n*   The product, **Product 2**, is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) reacts with thionyl chloride in a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   The product, **Product 3**, is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n\n*   Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with a mild, bulky reducing agent. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is known to selectively reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the corresponding alcohol.\n*   The product, **Product 4**, is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** We must consider the symmetry of the molecule, taking into account the rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation) of the cyclopentane ring. On the NMR time scale, the ring can be considered to have an average, planar-like symmetry.\n    *   Let's check if C1 (the carbon attached to the -CHO group) is a stereocenter. A carbon is a stereocenter if it is attached to four different groups. C1 is attached to:\n        1.  -H\n        2.  -CHO\n        3.  The ring path -C2-C3-C4-C5-\n        4.  The ring path -C5-C4-C3-C2-\n        Since the two paths around the ring are identical, C1 is **not** a stereocenter.\n    *   Because C1 is not a stereocenter, the molecule is achiral and possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the H-C1 bond, the C1-C(HO) bond, the C=O bond, and the aldehyde H. This plane bisects the cyclopentane ring, passing through C1 and the middle of the C3-C4 bond.\n*   **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons and hydrogens equivalent.\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C4.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** It lies on the plane of symmetry. It is unique. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** It also lies on the plane of symmetry. It is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:**\n    *   The two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic. One is on one side of the ring ('cis' to the CHO group, for example), and the other is on the opposite side ('trans').\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the 'cis' proton on C2 equivalent to the 'cis' proton on C5. This is a single chemical environment. (1 type, 2H total)\n    *   Similarly, the 'trans' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'trans' proton on C5. This is another chemical environment. (1 type, 2H total)\n    *   So, there are 2 types of hydrogens on the C2/C5 carbons.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:**\n    *   The same logic applies here. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic.\n    *   The 'cis' proton on C3 is equivalent to the 'cis' proton on C4. (1 type, 2H total)\n    *   The 'trans' proton on C3 is equivalent to the 'trans' proton on C4. (1 type, 2H total)\n    *   So, there are 2 types of hydrogens on the C3/C4 carbons.\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Aldehyde H: 1\n*   C1 H: 1\n*   C2/C5 protons: 2\n*   C3/C4 protons: 2\n*   Total number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
