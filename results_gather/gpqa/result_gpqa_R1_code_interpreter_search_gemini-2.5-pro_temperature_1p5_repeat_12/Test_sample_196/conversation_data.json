    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the provided spectral data.**\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The very broad absorption between **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a benzene ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** The broad singlet (bs) for one proton (1H) in this downfield region is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**). This confirms the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Putting the pieces together so far:** We have a para-substituted benzoic acid, with an unknown alkyl group at position 4: `R-C₆H₄-COOH`. Now let's determine the structure of the R group from the remaining signals.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Fragment: **-CH₂-CH₃**.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-). Fragment: **-CH-CH₃**.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the -CH₂- group from our first fragment. Its signal is a multiplet because it is split by both the adjacent -CH₃ group (from 0.9 ppm) and the -CH- group it must be attached to.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the -CH- group from our second fragment. This proton is benzylic (attached to the aromatic ring) and is split by the adjacent -CH₂- group and the adjacent -CH₃ group, resulting in a complex multiplet.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group (R):** By connecting the fragments, we get: Ring-**CH**(**CH₃**)-**CH₂**-**CH₃**. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Final Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the information, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to the structure in option (D).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reagents' Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of carbonyl-containing functional groups, including aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids, all the way down to the corresponding alkane (a methylene or methyl group).\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring itself are unreactive under these conditions.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Reaction:** `R-COOH + HI/P(red) → R-CH₃`\n    *   **Product:** The -COOH is converted to -CH₃. Therefore, the product is 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene, which is also named **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. This is still a carboxylic acid; the reduction has not occurred.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: **Correct.** This matches our predicted product structure and name.\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material, Compound X, not the final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
