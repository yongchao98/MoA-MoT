    "An optically active compound must be chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   The molecule is planar around the carbon-carbon double bond. A planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex, bridged bicyclic molecule.\n    *   The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the molecule has chiral centers and a specific stereoisomer (a single enantiomer) is being described.\n    *   A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active. The structure does not possess a plane of symmetry that would make it a meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3).\n    *   However, the two ends of the molecule are identical (COOH groups), and the substituents on the chiral carbons are also identical (H and CH3 on each).\n    *   The stereochemistry is `(2R,3S)`, which means the two chiral centers have opposite configurations. In a molecule with two identical chiral centers, the R,S (or S,R) configuration results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry and are **achiral**, despite having chiral centers. They are optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   The stereochemistry is `(2R,3R)`. Both chiral centers have the same configuration.\n    *   This molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image (which is the (2S,3S) isomer).\n    *   Thus, the `(2R,3R)` isomer is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound and is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at C1. The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different due to the asymmetric location of the double bond relative to C1.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups in a *cis* relationship (all pointing in the same direction relative to the ring, e.g., all axial or all equatorial in a chair conformation).\n    *   This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH bond and bisecting the opposite C-C bond.\n    *   Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name. The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, indicating a 4-carbon chain with a ketone function at C1. `C4-C3-C2-C1(=O)-`. A `cyclopentyl` group is attached to C1, and a `methyl` group is attached to C3.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. This can also be seen as isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential chiral center is C3.\n    *   The C3 atom is bonded to four groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H).\n        2.  A methyl group from the end of the chain (-CH3, which is C4).\n        3.  The `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group.\n        4.  A substituent methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   So, the groups on C3 are -H, -CH3, -CH3, and the rest of the chain. Let's write the structure more clearly: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. The carbon in the `CH` group is C3. It is attached to H, two identical -CH3 groups, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group.\n    *   Since C3 is attached to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry (containing the H-C3-C2-C1=O bonds and bisecting the angle between the two C3-methyl bonds).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione** (Yes)\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid** (Yes)\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol** (Yes)\n\nTotal count of optically active compounds is 3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
