    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of ion concentrations in a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical system:** The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O). When dissolved in water, they dissociate into their respective ions:\n    *   KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4-\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O\n\n    The key species are the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-), which acts as a weak acid, and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-), which is its conjugate base. These two form a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the molar amounts of the buffer components:**\n    *   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm3 = 0.20000 L\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = Mass of KH2PO4 / Molar mass of KH2PO4\n        Moles of H2PO4- = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O / Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O\n        Moles of HPO4^2- = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   [H2PO4-] = Moles of H2PO4- / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = Moles of HPO4^2- / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n4.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer:** The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka2:\n    *   H2PO4-  ⇌  H+ + HPO4^2-\n    *   Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8\n\n    The equilibrium expression is:\n    *   Ka2 = ([H+] * [HPO4^2-]) / [H2PO4-]\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n    *   [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    *   [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H+] = 8.113 x 10^-8 M\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) concentration:** The orthophosphate ion is formed by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka3:\n    *   HPO4^2-  ⇌  H+ + PO4^3-\n    *   Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12\n\n    The equilibrium expression is:\n    *   Ka3 = ([H+] * [PO4^3-]) / [HPO4^2-]\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]. The concentrations of [H+] and [HPO4^2-] are determined by the main buffer equilibrium and can be considered constant for this secondary, much weaker dissociation.\n    *   [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n    *   [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12 * 0.02809 M) / (8.113 x 10^-8 M)\n    *   [PO4^3-] = 6.236 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis calculation can be performed efficiently using a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nvol_L = 0.20000\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Calculate the moles of the acid (H2PO4-) and the conjugate base (HPO4^2-)\nmoles_acid = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_base = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Calculate the concentrations\nconc_acid = moles_acid / vol_L\nconc_base = moles_base / vol_L\n\n# Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] -> [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_acid / conc_base)\n\n# Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-] concentration from the third dissociation\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] -> [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\n# The concentration of HPO4^2- at equilibrium is approximately its initial concentration\nPO4_3minus_conc = (Ka3 * conc_base) / H_plus_conc\n\n# Print the final result in the requested format\nprint(f\"{PO4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their roles.**\n    *   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n    *   When dissolved in water, KH2PO4 provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-), which acts as a weak acid.\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-), which is the conjugate base of H2PO4-.\n    *   These two species form a buffer solution. The relevant equilibrium that determines the pH of the solution is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\n        *   H2PO4-  ⇌  H+ + HPO4^2-      (governed by Ka2)\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial moles of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n    *   Mass of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g; Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n    *   Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g; Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 moles / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 moles / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer.**\n    *   We use the equilibrium expression for Ka2: Ka2 = ([H+][HPO4^2-]) / [H2PO4-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H+], assuming the initial concentrations are approximately equal to the equilibrium concentrations because the dissociation is small.\n    *   [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    *   [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H+] ≈ 8.113 x 10^-8 M\n\n5.  **Calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-).**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of the HPO4^2- ion, which is governed by Ka3.\n        *   HPO4^2-  ⇌  H+ + PO4^3-      (governed by Ka3)\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka3 = ([H+][PO4^3-]) / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   We can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-]. We use the [H+] calculated from the main buffer equilibrium and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-].\n    *   [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n    *   [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12 * 0.02809 M) / (8.113 x 10^-8 M)\n    *   [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.236 x 10^-7 M\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    *   A) 3.97x10^-7 M\n    *   B) 6.24x10^-7 M\n    *   C) 2.81x10^-7 M\n    *   D) 5.48x10^-7 M\n    *   The calculated value, 6.236 x 10^-7 M, rounds to 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n\nThe calculation performed in the Python script confirms this result. The script executes the same steps: calculating moles, then concentrations, then [H+] using Ka2, and finally [PO4^3-] using Ka3. The output `6.24e-07` is equivalent to 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n\n<<<B>>>"
