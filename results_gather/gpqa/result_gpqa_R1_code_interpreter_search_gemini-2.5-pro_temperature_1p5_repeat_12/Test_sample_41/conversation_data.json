    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (P3 / P1).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   Three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3) in circular orbits around the same star.\n    *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n    *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n    *   Ratio of masses: M1 / M2 ≈ 1.15 and M2 / M3 ≈ 1.35.\n    *   Albedo (A) is the same for all three planets (A = 0.3).\n\n3.  **Identify Relevant Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its star. The formula is:\n        `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n        where `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis (orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n        `P² ∝ a³`\n\n4.  **Formulate a Strategy:**\n    *   The problem involves orbital periods (P) and equilibrium temperatures (T_eq). I need to find a relationship between these two quantities.\n    *   From the equilibrium temperature formula, for planets orbiting the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and having the same albedo (`A` is constant), the temperature is related to the orbital radius `a` as follows:\n        `T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)`\n        This can be rearranged to express `a` in terms of `T_eq`:\n        `sqrt(a) ∝ 1 / T_eq`  =>  `a ∝ 1 / T_eq²`\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law, we can express the period `P` in terms of `a`:\n        `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n    *   Now, I can substitute the expression for `a` from the temperature relationship into the Kepler's Law relationship:\n        `P ∝ (1 / T_eq²)^(3/2)`\n        `P ∝ 1 / T_eq³`\n    *   This gives us the direct relationship between the orbital period and the equilibrium temperature. The orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n    *   Using this proportionality, the ratio P3 / P1 can be written as:\n        `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³`\n    *   The mass ratios and the specific value of the albedo are extra information not needed for the calculation, as they cancel out when taking ratios (since albedo is the same for all planets) or are not part of the relevant equations (mass of the planets).\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   First, I need to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3`. I can get this by multiplying the two given temperature ratios:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)`\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = 1.4 * 2.3`\n    *   Now, I need to calculate the value of `(T_eq1 / T_eq3)³`. I will use a python script for this.\n\n```python\n# Given ratios\nT1_div_T2 = 1.4\nT2_div_T3 = 2.3\n\n# Calculate the ratio T1/T3\nT1_div_T3 = T1_div_T2 * T2_div_T3\n\n# From the derived relationship P3/P1 = (T1/T3)^3\nP3_div_P1 = T1_div_T3**3\n\nprint(P3_div_P1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n33.38628800000001\n</execute_result>\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.39. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
