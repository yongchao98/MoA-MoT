    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the functional groups and main structure:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The formula for this core is C6H4.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The compound contains a -COO- functional group. This accounts for two oxygen atoms in the final formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum signals to identify the substituents:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring with only two signals in the aromatic region is highly characteristic of a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern. Due to symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons, leading to two signals (often appearing as two doublets).\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to another group that doesn't have protons to couple with (like the aromatic ring).\n        *   Let's denote the group as `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n        *   Proton H(a) is split only by proton H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   Proton H(b) is split by proton H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (a quartet, from n+1 rule where n=3). This combined splitting gives a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` substituent. This fragment adds C3H5 to the formula.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):**\n        *   One signal comes from the methyl group of the propenyl substituent (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This signal itself would be a doublet, split by the adjacent vinyl proton H(b).\n        *   The second signal must belong to the ester group. The problem states there are **no signals for -CH2 groups**. This eliminates the possibility of an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or other larger alkyl esters. Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`). This group gives a characteristic singlet signal.\n        *   The methyl ester substituent (`-COOCH3`) adds C2H3O2 to the formula.\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure and determine the formula:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n    *   One substituent is a propenyl group (-C3H5).\n    *   The other substituent is a methyl ester group (-COOCH3).\n\n    Let's sum the atoms from all the fragments:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from COOCH3) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from COOCH3) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from COOCH3) = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) C12H14O2\n    B) C11H14O2\n    C) C11H12O2\n    D) C12H12O2\n\n    Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\nTo double-check the atom count, we can use a simple script.\n```python\n# Initialize atom counts\nelements = {'C': 0, 'H': 0, 'O': 0}\n\n# Add atoms from the para-disubstituted benzene ring core\nelements['C'] += 6\nelements['H'] += 4\n\n# Add atoms from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)\nelements['C'] += 3\nelements['H'] += 5\n\n# Add atoms from the methyl ester group (-COOCH3)\nelements['C'] += 2  # One for C=O, one for O-CH3\nelements['H'] += 3\nelements['O'] += 2\n\n# Format and print the final chemical formula\nprint(f\"C{elements['C']}H{elements['H']}O{elements['O']}\")\n```\n```output\nC11H12O2\n```\nThe analysis of the spectroscopic data leads to a unique structure whose molecular formula is C11H12O2. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogen atoms with other groups. The core of our molecule is therefore C6H4.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **FTIR:** Shows an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   **Two Aromatic-H Signals:** For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals in the aromatic region strongly suggests a 1,4- (para-) substitution pattern due to the molecule's symmetry.\n        *   **Two Vinyl-H Signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n            *   The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split only by the other vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n            *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (making it a doublet) and also by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (making it a quartet). The combined effect is a doublet of quartets.\n            *   This substituent adds a C3H5 group to our formula.\n        *   **Two -CH3 Signals:** One signal is from the propenyl group's methyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The second signal must belong to the ester group.\n        *   **No -CH2 Signals:** The absence of a -CH2 signal is crucial. It eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3). Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3). This substituent adds a C2H3O2 group.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Full Formula:**\n    *   Start with the aromatic core: C6H4\n    *   Add the propenyl group: + C3H5\n    *   Add the methyl ester group: + C2H3O2\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 0 + 0 + 2 = 2\n\n    The final molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option C.\n\nThe Python code executed in the previous step also confirmed this calculation, summing the atoms of a para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4), a propenyl group (C3H5), and a methyl ester group (COOCH3) to arrive at C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
