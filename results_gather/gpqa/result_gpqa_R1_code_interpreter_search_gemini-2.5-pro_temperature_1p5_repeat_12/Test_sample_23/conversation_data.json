    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, with a general formula CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is 0.1428.\n*   Mass fraction of H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1) (using approximate atomic masses H=1, C=12).\n*   0.1428 = y / (12x + y)\n*   0.1428 * (12x + y) = y\n*   1.7136x + 0.1428y = y\n*   1.7136x = 0.8572y\n*   y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.\n*   The empirical formula of Z is CH2. The general formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n*   This general formula CnH2n corresponds to either alkenes or cycloalkanes.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. An alkene is unsaturated, so Z must be a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n*   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). We will proceed with the assumption that it's one of these, likely cyclohexane due to its commonality in the reactions described.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from mixture X.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (like Z) or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is the hydrocarbon Z (a cycloalkane).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means both components of Y, when hydrogenated, yield Z.\n*   Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). One component of Y is cyclohexane. The other component of Y must also be a C6 liquid that hydrogenates to cyclohexane and does not decolorize bromine water. The only C6 compound that fits this description is benzene (C6H6). Benzene is aromatic and only reacts with bromine in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, not with bromine water alone. Under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature with a catalyst), benzene can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, so X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   The reaction X -> Y is a disproportionation, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and the other is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n    *   X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> cyclohexane + benzene\n*   From this reaction, the stoichiometry must be 1:1 -> 1:1 because both X and Y are equimolar mixtures.\n*   Let's check the atom balance. The products are C6H12 and C6H6.\n    *   Total C atoms = 6 + 6 = 12.\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the reactants (one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2) must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Since hydrogenating both X1 and X2 gives Z (cyclohexane, C6H12), both X1 and X2 must be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons with the same carbon skeleton as cyclohexane.\n*   So, X1 is C6Ha and X2 is C6Hb, where a + b = 18.\n*   The reaction is: C6Ha + C6Hb -> C6H12 + C6H6.\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer. One compound loses hydrogen to become benzene, and the other gains hydrogen to become cyclohexane.\n    *   One reactant must have more hydrogen than benzene (Ha > 6) and will be oxidized: C6Ha -> C6H6.\n    *   The other reactant must have less hydrogen than cyclohexane (Hb < 12) and will be reduced: C6Hb -> C6H12.\n*   The components of X are unsaturated C6 cyclic molecules, but they do not have conjugated multiple bonds. Let's list the possibilities:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One double bond, not conjugated. This is a possible component.\n    *   **Cyclohexadienes (C6H8)**:\n        *   1,3-cyclohexadiene: Has conjugated double bonds. This is ruled out by the problem statement.\n        *   **1,4-cyclohexadiene**: Has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. This is a possible component.\n*   We need to find a pair from our possible components (cyclohexene C6H10 and 1,4-cyclohexadiene C6H8) such that their hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   Let X1 = cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n*   Let's check the reaction with this pair:\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) loses 2H to become benzene (C6H6). This is oxidation.\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) gains 2H to become cyclohexane (C6H12). This is reduction.\n    *   The overall reaction is C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer (disproportionation).\n*   Thus, mixture X consists of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Liquid 1 (X1): Cyclohexene (C6H10) has **10** hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2 (X2): 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has **8** hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
