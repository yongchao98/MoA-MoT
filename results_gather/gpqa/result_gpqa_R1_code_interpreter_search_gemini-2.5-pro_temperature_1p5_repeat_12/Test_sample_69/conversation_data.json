    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 4: D(gas) + B(gas) -> H(solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.**\n    This clue describes the formation of a solvent from two gases. A classic example of such a reaction is the equilibrium between nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen tetroxide:\n    `2NO2(g) <=> N2O4(l)`\n    Here, N2O4 is a well-known non-aqueous solvent. This reaction can be written as `NO2 + NO2 -> N2O4`, fitting the 1:1 ratio. This suggests that gas B and gas D are the same substance: **NO2**.\n    *   **B = NO2**\n    *   **D = NO2**\n    *   **H = N2O4**\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.**\n    Let's test our hypothesis (B=NO2) with this clue. The reaction involves the hydrolysis of C. The products include a strong acid and a weak acid. Nitrogen dioxide itself reacts with water in a disproportionation reaction:\n    `2NO2 + H2O -> HNO3 + HNO2`\n    Nitric acid (HNO3) is a **strong acid (F)**, and nitrous acid (HNO2) is a **weak acid (G)**. This is a perfect match for the description of acids F and G.\n    The clue states that the reaction is `C + H2O -> A + F + G`. This strongly implies that C is a compound that, upon contact with water, releases A and NO2, with the NO2 then reacting with water as described above.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 1: Solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.**\n    Using B=NO2, the reaction is:\n    `A(s) + 8NO2(g) -> C(red, s)`\n    This suggests that C is a complex or adduct formed between the solid A and 8 molecules of NO2. While the exact identity of A is not required to solve the puzzle, this formulation is plausible. C is a carrier for NO2 molecules, which are released during the hydrolysis in clue 3, reforming the solid carrier A.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce the extremely hazardous product E.**\n    Using D=NO2, the reaction is:\n    `C + 2NO2 -> E (extremely hazardous)`\n    C is a complex rich in nitro groups (`A(NO2)8`). Its reaction with more NO2 likely produces a higher, unstable, and hazardous oxide of nitrogen. A prime candidate for E is **Dinitrogen Pentoxide (N2O5)**. N2O5 is a powerful, potentially explosive oxidizing and nitrating agent, fitting the description \"extremely hazardous\". Its formation from other nitrogen oxides is chemically reasonable.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E.**\n    The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of product E, which we have identified as N2O5. We need to determine the point group of the N2O5 molecule.\n    *   In the solid state, N2O5 is ionic: [NO2]+[NO3]− (nitronium nitrate).\n    *   In the gas phase, it is a covalent molecule with the structure O2N-O-NO2.\n    *   The molecule has a bent N-O-N central bridge. The two NO2 groups are twisted relative to the N-O-N plane.\n    *   This non-planar structure possesses only one symmetry element: a two-fold rotational axis (C2) that passes through the central oxygen atom and bisects the N-O-N angle.\n    *   A molecule with only a C2 axis as its sole symmetry element belongs to the **C2** point group.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    The chain of deductions leads to E being N2O5, which has a C2 point group. This matches option A.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning process has identified E as N2O5.\n# The question is about the molecular symmetry group of N2O5.\n# Based on chemical knowledge, the point group of gaseous N2O5 is C2.\n# This corresponds to option A.\n# No computation is needed.\n\n# Final answer is determined by chemical reasoning.\nprint(\"A\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning that leads to the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Gas B and D, and Solvent H:**\n    *   The fourth clue states: \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\" Both B and D are gases.\n    *   A classic chemical reaction that fits this description is the dimerization of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) into dinitrogen tetroxide (N₂O₄):\n        `2 NO₂(g) <=> N₂O₄(l)`\n    *   This can be viewed as `NO₂ + NO₂ -> N₂O₄`. N₂O₄ is a known non-aqueous solvent.\n    *   This strongly suggests that **B = NO₂**, **D = NO₂**, and **H = N₂O₄**.\n\n2.  **Identify Acids F and G:**\n    *   The third clue states: \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"\n    *   Let's see how our proposed gas B (NO₂) reacts with water. Nitrogen dioxide undergoes a disproportionation reaction in water:\n        `2 NO₂ + H₂O -> HNO₃ + HNO₂`\n    *   Nitric acid (**HNO₃**) is a strong acid, and nitrous acid (**HNO₂**) is a weak acid. This perfectly matches the description of F and G.\n    *   So, **F = HNO₃** (strong acid) and **G = HNO₂** (weak acid).\n    *   This confirms our identification of B as NO₂. The clue implies that C hydrolyzes, releasing NO₂ which then reacts with water.\n\n3.  **Characterize Compound C and A:**\n    *   The first clue is: \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"\n    *   Substituting B = NO₂, the reaction is:\n        `A(s) + 8 NO₂(g) -> C(red)`\n    *   C is an adduct or a complex formed between solid A and eight molecules of NO₂. When C reacts with water (clue 3), it decomposes back to A and releases the NO₂ molecules, which then form the acids F and G.\n\n4.  **Identify Hazardous Product E:**\n    *   The second clue is: \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n    *   Substituting D = NO₂, the reaction is:\n        `C + 2 NO₂(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)`\n    *   C is already rich in NO₂ groups. Reacting it with more NO₂ likely forms a higher, more unstable, and thus hazardous oxide of nitrogen. A prime candidate for E is **dinitrogen pentoxide (N₂O₅)**. N₂O₅ is a powerful and potentially explosive nitrating agent and oxidizer, fitting the description \"extremely hazardous.\"\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E (N₂O₅):**\n    *   The final question asks for the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E. We have identified E as N₂O₅.\n    *   In the gas phase, the N₂O₅ molecule has the structure O₂N-O-NO₂.\n    *   The molecule is non-planar. It consists of two planar NO₂ groups connected by a central oxygen atom. The two NO₂ planes are twisted with respect to each other.\n    *   Let's analyze its symmetry elements:\n        *   There is no plane of symmetry (σ).\n        *   There is no center of inversion (i).\n        *   There is one **two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) passing through the central oxygen atom and bisecting the N-O-N angle.**\n    *   A molecule that possesses only a C₂ axis as its sole symmetry element (besides the trivial identity element E) belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (N₂O₅) is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
