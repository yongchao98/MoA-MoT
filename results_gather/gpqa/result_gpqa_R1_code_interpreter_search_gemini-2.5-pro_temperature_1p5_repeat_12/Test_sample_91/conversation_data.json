    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the following formula, based on Hess's law:\n\nΔHf = [Total enthalpy of atomization of elements in their standard states] - [Total bond energy of the compound]\n\nThe process involves these steps:\n1.  **Determine the molecular formula** of the compound to know how many moles of atoms of each element are needed.\n2.  **Count the number of each type of bond** in the molecule.\n3.  **Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of the reactants** (elements C and H in their standard states).\n4.  **Calculate the total bond energy of the product** (the molecule).\n5.  **Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf)** by subtracting the total bond energy of the product from the total enthalpy of atomization of the reactants.\n6.  **Check the units** of the result and compare with the given options.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and count bonds.**\n\nThe structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let's analyze its composition:\n*   The backbone consists of 7 carbon atoms. Let's trace the connections: C=C-C-C-C-C=C.\n*   There are methyl (CH3) groups attached: two on the first carbon, one on the fourth, and two on the seventh. That's a total of 5 methyl groups.\n*   **Total Carbon atoms (C):** 7 in the backbone + 5 in the methyl groups = 12 carbons.\n*   **Total Hydrogen atoms (H):**\n    *   On the backbone: =CH- (1 H), -CH2- (2 H), -CH(CH3)- (1 H), -CH2- (2 H), -CH= (1 H). Total = 1+2+1+2+1 = 7 H.\n    *   On the 5 methyl groups: 5 * 3 = 15 H.\n    *   Total = 7 + 15 = 22 hydrogens.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C12H22.\n\nNow, let's count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure contains two double bonds (`=`). So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C bonds:**\n    *   In the backbone: C=C-C-C-C-C=C. The single bonds are between C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6. That's 4 C-C bonds.\n    *   Connecting methyl groups: Two on the first C, one on the fourth C, two on the seventh C. That's 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 C-C bonds.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 4 + 5 = 9.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of reactants.**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\nWe need to convert the reactants (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of gaseous H2) into gaseous atoms (12 moles of C and 22 moles of H).\n\n*   **For Carbon:** The enthalpy of atomization of carbon is given as 1000 kJ/mol.\n    *   Energy for 12 moles of C = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   **For Hydrogen:** The bond energy of H-H is given as 100 kJ/mol. This is the energy to break one mole of H2 into 2 moles of H atoms. We need 22 H atoms, which means we must break 11 moles of H2.\n    *   Energy for 11 moles of H2 = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   **Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total bond energy of the product.**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the C12H22 molecule.\n*   **Energy from C-H bonds:** 22 bonds * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ.\n*   **Energy from C=C bonds:** 2 bonds * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.\n*   **Energy from C-C bonds:** 9 bonds * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ.\n*   **Total bond energy of the product** = 8800 kJ + 600 kJ + 1800 kJ = 11200 kJ.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf).**\n\nΔHf = (Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of the product)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ - 11200 kJ = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with options.**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol\nC) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the total bond energy of the product, not the enthalpy of formation)\nD) 11.44 kJ/g\n\nOur result is 1900 kJ/mol. Option A has the correct number but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol), making the value physically unrealistic. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check option D.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    *   Mass = (12 * 12 g/mol) + (22 * 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔHf (per gram) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option D. Therefore, the question asks for the specific enthalpy of formation (per gram).\n\n```python\n# Given values\nH_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nBE_H_H = 100    # kJ/mol\nBE_C_C = 200    # kJ/mol\nBE_C_eq_C = 300 # kJ/mol\nBE_C_H = 400    # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular formula: C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of H2 molecules needed\nnum_H2 = num_H / 2\n\n# 1.

    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Objective:** Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n2.  **Formula:** The enthalpy of formation is calculated using the energies involved in breaking the bonds of the reactant elements in their standard states and forming the bonds of the product molecule. The formula is:\n    ΔHf = [Total enthalpy of atomization of elements] - [Total bond energy of the product molecule]\n\n3.  **Step 1: Analyze the Molecule (Product)**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n    *   **Count Carbon Atoms (C):** There are two (CH3) groups, then a C, then a CH, a CH2, a CH with another CH3, another CH2, a CH, a C, and finally two more (CH3) groups.\n        *   C count: 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 11 carbons. Let's re-draw and count carefully.\n        *   Let's number the main chain: C1=C2-C3-C4-C5-C6=C7.\n        *   Attachments: Two CH3 on C1, one CH3 on C4, two CH3 on C7.\n        *   Total Carbons = 7 (in the chain) + 5 (in methyl groups) = 12 carbons.\n    *   **Count Hydrogen Atoms (H):**\n        *   In the 5 CH3 groups: 5 * 3 = 15 H.\n        *   In the main chain: C1 (no H), C2 (1 H), C3 (2 H), C4 (1 H), C5 (2 H), C6 (1 H), C7 (no H). Total = 1+2+1+2+1 = 7 H.\n        *   Total Hydrogens = 15 + 7 = 22 hydrogens.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C12H22.\n    *   **Count Bonds in the Molecule:**\n        *   **C-H bonds:** Equal to the number of H atoms = 22.\n        *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure = 2.\n        *   **C-C bonds:**\n            *   Bonds within the main chain: C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6. That's 4 C-C bonds.\n            *   Bonds connecting methyl groups to the chain: 2 on C1 + 1 on C4 + 2 on C7 = 5 C-C bonds.\n            *   Total C-C bonds = 4 + 5 = 9.\n\n4.  **Step 2: Calculate Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n    *   The formation reaction is from elements in their standard states: `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)`.\n    *   We need to convert these reactants into gaseous atoms: `12 C(g)` and `22 H(g)`.\n    *   **Energy for Carbon:** We need 12 moles of C atoms.\n        *   Energy = 12 mol * (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n    *   **Energy for Hydrogen:** We need 22 moles of H atoms, which come from 11 moles of H2 gas.\n        *   Energy = 11 mol * (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n    *   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization:** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ.\n\n5.  **Step 3: Calculate Total Bond Energy of the Product (C12H22)**\n    *   This is the energy released when all the bonds in one mole of the product are formed, or equivalently, the energy required to break them.\n    *   **Energy from C-H bonds:** 22 bonds * (Bond energy of C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ.\n    *   **Energy from C=C bonds:** 2 bonds * (Bond energy of C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.\n    *   **Energy from C-C bonds:** 9 bonds * (Bond energy of C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ.\n    *   **Total Bond Energy of Product:** 8800 kJ + 600 kJ + 1800 kJ = 11200 kJ.\n\n6.  **Step 4: Calculate Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf) in kJ/mol**\n    *   ΔHf = (Total Enthalpy of Atomization) - (Total Bond Energy of Product)\n    *   ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n7.  **Step 5: Check Units and Compare with Options**\n    *   The calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol.\n    *   Option A is 1900 kJ/g, which is dimensionally different and physically improbable.\n    *   Option C is 11200 kJ/mol, which is the total bond energy of the product.\n    *   Options A and D are in kJ/g. Let's convert our result to these units.\n    *   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n        *   Molar Mass = (12 * atomic mass of C) + (22 * atomic mass of H)\n        *   Molar Mass = (12 * 12.01 g/mol) + (22 * 1.008 g/mol) ≈ 166.3 g/mol. (Using integer masses 12 and 1 as is common in such problems: 12*12 + 22*1 = 166 g/mol).\n    *   **Convert to kJ/g:**\n        *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g.\n    *   This value matches option D (11.44 kJ/g) when rounded.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** The reasoning and calculation steps are sound. The python code execution confirms the numerical results. The calculated specific enthalpy of formation is approximately 11.45 kJ/g.\n\n<<<D>>>"
