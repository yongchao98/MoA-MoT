    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Structure Core:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This most commonly means a benzene ring with two substituents, with the formula C6H4.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The compound contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbons.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means one of the substituents on the aromatic ring is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I).\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   We have a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for a C2 substituent containing a C=O group:\n    *   **-C(O)CH3 (acetyl group):** This is a very common and stable group. It consists of a carbonyl bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   **-CH2CHO (2-oxoethyl group):** This consists of a methylene group (-CH2-) attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   Combining these substituents with the C6H4 core, we get two primary candidate molecules:\n    1.  **Haloacetophenone:** The structure is X-C6H4-C(O)CH3. It has 8 carbons, a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl, and an Ar-X bond.\n    2.  **(Halophenyl)acetaldehyde:** The structure is X-C6H4-CH2CHO. It also has 8 carbons, a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl, and an Ar-X bond.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Candidate Structures**\n\nThe provided NMR options B and C show a pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, which is a classic fingerprint for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. This symmetry simplifies the spectrum, so let's assume this substitution pattern for our predictions.\n\n*   **Prediction for para-Haloacetophenone (Structure 1: p-X-C6H4-C(O)CH3)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Due to para-substitution, they are divided into two chemically equivalent sets. This results in two signals, each integrating to 2 protons. They are adjacent, so they will split each other into doublets (d). The carbonyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will be downfield (higher ppm). Expected signals: ~7.8-8.0 ppm (2H, d) and ~7.4-7.7 ppm (2H, d).\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, they will not be split and will appear as a singlet (s). The typical chemical shift is around 2.5 ppm. Expected signal: ~2.5 ppm (3H, s).\n    *   **Summary prediction:** Two doublets in the aromatic region (2H each) and one singlet in the aliphatic region (3H).\n\n*   **Prediction for para-(Halophenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure 2: p-X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** Similar to the above, we expect two doublets (d) for the 4 aromatic protons, each integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** The aldehyde proton is highly deshielded and appears far downfield. It is adjacent to the -CH2- group (2 protons), so it should be split into a triplet (t) by the rule n+1 (2+1=3). Expected signal: ~9.5-10.0 ppm (1H, t).\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** These two protons are adjacent to the single aldehyde proton. They will be split into a doublet (d) by the rule n+1 (1+1=2). Their chemical shift would be around 3.7 ppm. Expected signal: ~3.7 ppm (2H, d).\n    *   **Summary prediction:** Two doublets in the aromatic region (2H each), one doublet in the aliphatic region (2H), and one triplet at a very high chemical shift (1H).\n\n**4. Compare Predictions with the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), ... 1.3 (2H, s)**: This data is inconsistent. It only shows one aromatic proton, and the integration of the singlet at 1.3 ppm is unusual. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**:\n    *   Aromatic region: 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d). This matches our prediction for a para-disubstituted ring.\n    *   Aliphatic region: 2.3 ppm (3H, s). This is a methyl singlet.\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the prediction for **para-haloacetophenone**. All features (integrations, chemical shifts, and splitting patterns) are correct.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**:\n    *   This spectrum has the characteristic aldehyde proton peak at 9.9 ppm and the methylene peak at 3.7 ppm, suggesting the (halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure.\n    *   **However, the splitting patterns are incorrect.** The aldehyde proton is listed as a singlet (s) instead of a triplet (t), and the methylene protons are listed as a singlet (s) instead of a doublet (d). This indicates an absence of the expected coupling between these adjacent protons, which is chemically implausible under normal conditions.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: This option lists no signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). A di-substituted aromatic ring must have aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption B is the only choice that describes a chemically correct and self-consistent 1H NMR spectrum that corresponds to a molecule (para-haloacetophenone) fitting all the structural and spectroscopic information given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<B>>>"
