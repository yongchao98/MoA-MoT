    "An electron is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be represented by a two-component vector (spinor). The given spin state is:\n|ψ> = (3i, 4) which can be written as a column vector:\n`|ψ> = [3i, 4]^T`\n\nThe operator for the spin projection along the y-direction is `S_y`. It is related to the Pauli spin matrix `σ_y` by:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.\n\nThe Pauli matrix `σ_y` is given as:\n`σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `A` for a state `|ψ>` is calculated using the formula:\n`<A> = <ψ|A|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\n\nFirst, let's find the bra-vector `<ψ|`, which is the conjugate transpose of the ket-vector `|ψ>`.\n`|ψ> = [3i, 4]^T`\n`<ψ| = [(3i)*, 4*] = [-3i, 4]` (since the conjugate of `3i` is `-3i` and the conjugate of `4` is `4`).\n\nNext, we calculate the normalization factor `<ψ|ψ>`:\n`<ψ|ψ> = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]^T`\n`<ψ|ψ> = (-3i)*(3i) + (4)*(4)`\n`<ψ|ψ> = -9i² + 16`\n`<ψ|ψ> = -9(-1) + 16`\n`<ψ|ψ> = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\nNow, let's calculate the term `<ψ|S_y|ψ>`.\nFirst, we apply the operator `S_y` to the state `|ψ>`:\n`S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T`\n`S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [(0*3i + (-i)*4), (i*3i + 0*4)]^T`\n`S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [-4i, 3i²]^T`\n`S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T`\n\nNow, we pre-multiply by the bra-vector `<ψ|`:\n`<ψ|S_y|ψ> = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T`\n`<ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3)]`\n`<ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]`\n`<ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12]`\n`<ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [-24]`\n`<ψ|S_y|ψ> = -12ħ`\n\nFinally, we find the expectation value `<S_y>`:\n`<S_y> = <ψ|S_y|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\n`<S_y> = -12ħ / 25`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) -12*hbar/25\nB) 25*hbar/2\nC) 12*hbar/25\nD) -25*hbar/2\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
