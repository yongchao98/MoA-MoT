    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic feature. A very broad absorption in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is indicative of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is forming hydrogen-bonded dimers. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound very likely contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons (H) directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This piece of data unequivocally confirms the presence of an alkene group, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence for identifying the functional group. We need to determine what chemical fragment has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45.\n        *   Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n            *   Mass = (1 × atomic mass of C) + (2 × atomic mass of O) + (1 × atomic mass of H)\n            *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45.\n        *   This m/z = 45 peak is a classic, very common fragment for carboxylic acids, often formed by alpha-cleavage.\n    *   **Conclusion from Mass Spec:** The presence of a fragment at m/z = 45 strongly supports the identification of the compound as a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize All Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we have strong evidence that the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid** (a molecule containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid).\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C) `C6H10O` and D) `C6H12O`, which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are now left with two possibilities: A) `C6H10O2` and B) `C6H12O2`.\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we can use the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is:\n        *   `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (for molecules containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   Our spectral data tells us we have one C=C bond (one degree of unsaturation) and one C=O bond (another degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total DoU of 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement for one C=C and one C=O bond.\n        *   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. A compound with this formula would be saturated (no C=C bonds), like hexanoic acid. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing an alkene.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The only molecular formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data (carboxylic acid group, alkene group, and a total of two degrees of unsaturation) is `C6H10O2`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
