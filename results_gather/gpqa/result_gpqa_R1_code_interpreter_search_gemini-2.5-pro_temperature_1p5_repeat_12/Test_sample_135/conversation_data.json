    "This problem asks for the evaluation of the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f(r)`.\nThe vector field is given by its magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and its direction, which is purely radial from the origin.\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field**\n\nIn spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, a purely radial vector field can be expressed as:\n`f(r) = f_r(r) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\nGiven the magnitude `|f(r)| = f_r(r) = 1/r^2`, the vector field is:\n`f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n\n**2. State the Integral**\n\nWe need to evaluate the following volume integral:\n`I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\nwhere `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\n**3. Method 1: Using the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the field over the boundary of the volume. It states:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\nwhere `S` is the closed surface enclosing the volume `V`. In this case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius R.\n\n*   **The vector field on the surface S:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the field `f` on the surface is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n*   **The differential surface element dS:** For a sphere, the differential area element `dS` in spherical coordinates points radially outward. Its magnitude is `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. As a vector, it is:\n    `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`\n*   **The dot product f ⋅ dS:** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n*   **The surface integral:** We now integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for `θ` are from 0 to `π`, and for `φ` are from 0 to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `= (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ)`\n    Evaluating the integrals:\n    `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π`\n    `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    The result of the surface integral is `(2π) * (2) = 4π`.\n\nTherefore, by the Divergence Theorem, the value of the volume integral is `4π`.\n\n**4. Method 2: Calculating the Divergence Directly**\n\nThe formula for the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` in spherical coordinates is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * f_r) + ...` (other terms are zero since `f_θ=f_φ=0`)\nGiven `f_r = 1/r^2`:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * (1/r^2)) = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (1) = 0`\n\nThis calculation shows that the divergence is zero for any `r ≠ 0`. However, the vector field `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat` is singular at the origin `(r=0)`. The divergence at this point is not zero. In fact, the divergence of this specific field is a three-dimensional Dirac delta function:\n`∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`\n\nThis is a standard result, often derived in the context of Gauss's Law for a point charge in electrostatics.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the volume integral:\n`I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\nThe integral of a function multiplied by a Dirac delta function `δ³(r)` over a volume `V` that contains the origin (`r=0`) simply evaluates the function at the origin.\n`I = 4π ∫_V δ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The value of the integral is `4π`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 4 π\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
