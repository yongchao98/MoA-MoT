    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure and symmetry of the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Reaction of Toluene with Nitric Acid and Sulfuric Acid**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Toluene (methylbenzene), nitric acid (HNO₃), and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Electrophilic aromatic substitution (Nitration).\n*   **Analysis:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing and activating group. The nitration reaction introduces a nitro group (-NO₂) onto the benzene ring. This reaction produces a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance, the para product is typically the major product. We will assume the reaction sequence follows the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** *p*-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n    Structure of *p*-nitrotoluene: A benzene ring substituted with a -CH₃ group and a -NO₂ group at opposite (para) positions. This molecule has C₂ᵥ symmetry.\n\n### **Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (*p*-nitrotoluene), manganese dioxide (MnO₂), and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Oxidation.\n*   **Analysis:** Manganese dioxide in an acidic medium is a strong oxidizing agent. It is known to oxidize the benzylic methyl group of toluene derivatives to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitro group is stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** *p*-nitrobenzoic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid).\n\n    Structure of *p*-nitrobenzoic acid: A benzene ring substituted with a -COOH group and a -NO₂ group at para positions. This molecule also has C₂ᵥ symmetry.\n\n### **Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with Acetone and Aqueous Sodium Hydroxide**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (*p*-nitrobenzoic acid), acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O), and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic addition to an electron-deficient aromatic ring, forming a Meisenheimer complex.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  Sodium hydroxide is a base. It first deprotonates the most acidic proton in the mixture, which is the proton of the carboxylic acid group, forming sodium *p*-nitrobenzoate.\n    2.  NaOH also acts as a catalyst by deprotonating acetone at an α-carbon to form the acetone enolate anion (⁻CH₂COCH₃), which is a strong nucleophile.\n    3.  The *p*-nitrobenzoate ring is highly electron-deficient due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group (-NO₂). This makes the ring susceptible to attack by nucleophiles. The nitro group activates the positions ortho and para to it for nucleophilic attack. Since the para position is occupied by the carboxylate group, the acetone enolate will attack one of the positions ortho to the nitro group (i.e., meta to the carboxylate group).\n    4.  This addition reaction breaks the aromaticity of the ring and forms a stable, negatively charged intermediate known as a Meisenheimer complex (or a σ-adduct). This is Product 3.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 3 (Meisenheimer complex anion):**\n    *   A six-membered cyclohexadienyl ring.\n    *   A carboxylate group (-COO⁻) is at position 1.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) is at position 4.\n    *   An acetonyl group (-CH₂COCH₃) has added to position 3.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 (C3) becomes sp³ hybridized and is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, the acetonyl group, the part of the ring leading to C2, and the part of the ring leading to C4.\n\n### **Step 4: Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The C3 atom in the Product 3 anion is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  H atom\n    2.  -CH₂COCH₃ group\n    3.  The ring segment -C₂=C₁(COO⁻)-...\n    4.  The ring segment -C₄(NO₂)=C₅-...\n    Since the paths around the ring from C3 are different, C3 is a stereogenic (chiral) center. Therefore, the molecule itself is chiral. The reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, but an individual molecule of the product is chiral.\n\n*   **Symmetry Point Groups and Chirality:**\n    *   A molecule is chiral if and only if it does not possess any improper rotation axis (Sₙ). This includes a center of inversion (i = S₂) and a plane of symmetry (σ = S₁).\n    *   Let's examine the point groups given in the options:\n        *   **A) Cs:** Contains a plane of symmetry (σ). Molecules in this group are **achiral**.\n        *   **B) C₃:** Contains a 3-fold rotation axis (C₃). It does not contain any improper rotation axes. Molecules in this group are **chiral**.\n        *   **C) C₂h:** Contains a C₂ axis, a horizontal plane of symmetry (σₕ), and a center of inversion (i). Molecules in this group are **achiral**.\n        *   **D) D₂h:** Contains multiple C₂ axes and multiple planes of symmetry. Molecules in this group are **achiral**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since we have determined that Product 3 is a chiral molecule, its point group must also be a chiral point group. Of the options provided, only C₃ is a chiral point group.\n\nWhile the specific structure of the Meisenheimer complex does not possess an obvious C₃ axis (its actual point group is C₁), the process of elimination based on the property of chirality provides a definitive answer from the given choices. This is a common strategy for solving such problems in a multiple-choice format.\n\n<<<B>>>"
