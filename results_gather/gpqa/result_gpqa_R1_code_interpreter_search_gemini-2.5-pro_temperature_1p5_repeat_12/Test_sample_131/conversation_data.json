    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Information Given**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. The key is to identify the number of chemically non-equivalent protons based on molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Formula: C6H4(CH2CH3)2 = C10H14. (Fits)\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The four aromatic protons are all equivalent due to symmetry. They would produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    - Alkyl Protons: The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons would appear as a **quartet (4H)** and the CH3 protons as a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound would produce quartets and triplets, but the problem states all observed signals are singlets. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated. This eliminates option B.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Fits)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Protons: All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Fits)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry passing between the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons (on other carbons) and are equivalent to each other, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Protons: The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**. The ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Fits)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups and the center of the ring.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: This plane of symmetry makes the two protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Protons: The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (a 6H signal). The methyl group at C2 is unique (a 3H signal), and the methyl group at C5 is unique (a 3H signal). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H : 3H : 3H**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n### **3. Analyze the 1:1 Mixture Spectrum for Each Option**\n\nNow, we combine the spectra of the individual compounds for each option, assuming a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Analysis:** The spectrum of the mixture shows **two** singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers individually produces only **one** aromatic singlet (of intensity 2H), the mixture must contain two different isomers whose aromatic singlets appear at different chemical shifts. As both singlets originate from 2 protons, their ratio will naturally be 1:1. All remaining options (A, C, D) are pairs of different isomers and are thus plausible based on the aromatic region alone.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** This is the decisive part. The mixture shows **three** singlets in a **2:1:1 ratio**. Let's see which pair produces this pattern.\n\n    *   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one singlet of intensity 12H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two singlets, each of intensity 6H.\n        *   **Combined:** Assuming these three signals appear at different chemical shifts, we would get three singlets with intensities 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is **12:6:6**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This combination perfectly matches the experimental data without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n    *   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Combined:** This would result in a total of four alkyl singlets. This contradicts the data, which states there are only three.\n\n    *   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two singlets (6H, 6H).\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Combined:** This would result in up to five different alkyl singlets. To get only three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio (i.e., intensities 12H, 6H, 6H from a total of 24 methyl protons), multiple specific, accidental overlaps would need to occur. This is a much less likely and less straightforward explanation than Option A.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option A) is the only pair that directly and simply accounts for all the features of the 1H NMR spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Region:** Two 2H singlets give a 1:1 ratio.\n2.  **Alkyl Region:** One 12H singlet and two 6H singlets give three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<A>>>"
