    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State of the System:**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, so its spin is described by the spin operators `S_x`, `S_y`, `S_z`.\n    *   The magnetic moment is `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, the magnetic field is `B_initial = B * z_hat` (in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian for the initial state is `H_initial = -μ . B_initial = -γS . (B * z_hat) = -γB * S_z`.\n    *   The problem states the particle is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state (ground state). The energy is `E = -μ_z * B`. To minimize energy, the z-component of the magnetic moment, `μ_z`, must be positive and aligned with `B`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this means the expectation value of `S_z` must be positive. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`. The state with the lowest energy is the one with the highest `S_z` eigenvalue, which is the spin-up state along the z-axis.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is the eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`, denoted as `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the field is switched to `B_new = B * y_hat` (in the +Y direction).\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ . B_new = -γS . (B * y_hat) = -γB * S_y`.\n    *   The state of the system will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with this new Hamiltonian. Any observable `A` that does not commute with this new Hamiltonian will have an expectation value `<A(t)>` that can change over time.\n\n3.  **Oscillation Frequency and Energy Eigenstates:**\n    *   The time evolution of the system is governed by the superposition of the energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H`. The oscillation frequency of any observable is determined by the difference in energy between the eigenstates that are populated in the system.\n    *   The eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H = -γB * S_y` are the same as the eigenstates of the `S_y` operator. Let's call them `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the `S_y` operator are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues `E` of the Hamiltonian `H` are:\n        *   For the eigenstate `|+y>` (where `S_y` has eigenvalue `+ħ/2`): `E_+ = -γB * (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`.\n        *   For the eigenstate `|-y>` (where `S_y` has eigenvalue `-ħ/2`): `E_- = -γB * (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`.\n    *   The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H`. It can be written as a superposition of the new energy eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`. Specifically, `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`. This means both energy levels, `E_+` and `E_-`, are populated.\n    *   The frequency of oscillation of the expectation value of an operator like `S_z` is given by the Bohr frequency, which is related to the energy difference (`ΔE`) between the populated states:\n        `Ω = ΔE / ħ`\n    *   The energy difference is `ΔE = E_- - E_+ = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n    *   The oscillation (angular) frequency is therefore:\n        `Ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`, will oscillate with an angular frequency `Ω = γB`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) with the Larmor frequency `Ω = γB`.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
