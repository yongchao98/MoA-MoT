    "To solve this problem, we need to use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among different energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### **1. Understand the Core Physics**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels, an upper level 2 (N₂) and a lower level 1 (N₁), is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature of the gas.\n\n### **2. Define the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. This means we need to calculate the ratio of the ratios:\n\nFactor = (N₂/N₁)nospots / (N₂/N₁)spots\n\nLet:\n*   `R_ns` = the ratio when there are no spots. The temperature is `T_ns` = 6000 K.\n*   `R_s` = the ratio when there are spots. The effective temperature is `T_s` = 5500 K.\n\nSo, we need to calculate `F = R_ns / R_s`.\n\n### **3. Set up the Calculation**\n\nUsing the Boltzmann equation for each case:\n*   R_ns = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns))\n*   R_s = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_s))\n\nNow, let's find the factor F:\n\nF = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_s)) ]\n\nThe statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) cancel out, which is convenient as they are not provided.\n\nF = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_s))\n\nUsing the property of exponents (eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ), we get:\n\nF = exp[ (-ΔE / k * T_ns) - (-ΔE / k * T_s) ]\nF = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_ns - 1/T_s) ]\n\nTo make the calculation cleaner, we can rearrange the terms inside the parenthesis:\n\nF = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_s - 1/T_ns) ]\n\n### **4. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength (λ = 1448 Å).\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere:\n*   h is Planck's constant.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n*   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ meters.\n\n### **5. Compute the Final Value**\n\nNow we have all the pieces to calculate the factor F. We will use a Python script to perform the computation accurately.\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Define the physical constants (h, c, k).\n2.  Set the given temperatures (T_ns = 6000 K, T_s = 5500 K) and wavelength (λ = 1448 Å).\n3.  Calculate ΔE.\n4.  Substitute all values into the final equation for F.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J*s\nc = 299792458       # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given parameters\nlambda_angstrom = 1448  # Wavelength in Angstroms\nlambda_m = lambda_angstrom * 1e-10  # Convert wavelength to meters\n\nT_nospots = 6000  # Temperature of the photosphere without spots (in Kelvin)\nT_with_spots = 5500    # Effective temperature of the photosphere with spots (in Kelvin)\n\n# Calculate the energy difference, ΔE = E2 - E1\ndelta_E = (h * c) / lambda_m\n\n# The factor is F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_with_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\nexponent_term = (delta_E / k) * (1/T_with_spots - 1/T_nospots)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent_term)\n\nprint(factor)\n```",
    "The Python code calculated the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes.\n\nThe steps were:\n1.  **Formulate the Ratio of Ratios:** The problem asks for the factor F = (N₂/N₁)nospots / (N₂/N₁)spots. Using the Boltzmann equation, this simplifies to F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ].\n2.  **Calculate ΔE:** The energy difference between the levels was calculated using the provided wavelength λ = 1448 Å, with the formula ΔE = hc/λ.\n3.  **Input the Temperatures:** The temperatures for the spotted (T_spots = 5500 K) and unspotted (T_nospots = 6000 K) photosphere were used.\n4.  **Compute the Factor:** The script plugged these values into the derived formula.\n\nThe code's output is approximately 4.506. This matches one of the provided options.\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Our calculation was for `R_ns / R_s`. The problem states the ratio *decreases* when the star has spots, which means `R_ns` is greater than `R_s`, so our factor should be greater than 1. Our calculation confirms this.\n\nThe calculated value is ~4.5, which corresponds to option D.\n\nThe other information provided in the problem (stellar radius, mass, percentage of spot coverage) is not needed for solving this specific question, which focuses solely on the temperature change and the Boltzmann distribution.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n- T_nospots = 6000K\n- T_spots = 5500K\n- λ = 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 m\n- h = 6.626e-34 J s\n- c = 3e8 m/s\n- k = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.37e-18 J\nΔE / k ≈ 1.37e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 99275 K\n\nExponent = 99275 * (1/5500 - 1/6000)\nExponent = 99275 * ( (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) )\nExponent = 99275 * (500 / 33,000,000) ≈ 1.504\n\nFactor = exp(1.504) ≈ 4.5\n\nThe calculation is consistent.\n\n<<<D>>>"
