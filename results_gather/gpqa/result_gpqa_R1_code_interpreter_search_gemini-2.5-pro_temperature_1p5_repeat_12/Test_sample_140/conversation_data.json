    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n    *   Position C-2, which has a deuterium (D).\n    *   Position C-6, which has a hydrogen (H).\n\n    The base can abstract either H or D, leading to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6. The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this process is kinetically favored (faster). This is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE).\n        *   Abstraction of H⁺ from C-6 followed by the loss of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1 results in a triple bond between C-1 and C-6.\n        *   The deuterium atom at C-2 remains on the ring. The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**. This is the **major** intermediate.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2. This is slower due to the stronger C-D bond but still possible because NaNH₂ is a very strong base.\n        *   Abstraction of D⁺ from C-2 followed by the loss of Br⁻ from C-1 results in a triple bond between C-1 and C-2.\n        *   The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate formed is the standard, **non-deuterated benzyne**. This is the **minor** intermediate.\n        *   A byproduct of this pathway is deuterated ammonia (NH₂D), which will be present in the solvent mixture.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH₂⁻) or ammonia (NH₃), then attacks the triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH₃) to give the final aniline products.\n\n    *   **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from major Pathway A):**\n        This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C-1 or C-6).\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C-1, a carbanion is formed at C-6. This anion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃). The resulting product has the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C-6, a carbanion is formed at C-1, which is then protonated. The resulting product has the -NH₂ group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. When we renumber the ring to place the -NH₂ group at position 1, the deuterium is now at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   So, the major pathway produces two different products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n    *   **Addition to non-deuterated benzyne (from minor Pathway B):**\n        This benzyne intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium on the ring. The NH₂⁻ group attacks the benzyne, and the resulting carbanion is quenched by an acidic species in the solvent. The solvent contains a large amount of NH₃ and a small amount of NH₂D (formed during Pathway B).\n        *   **Protonation by NH₃:** The carbanion abstracts a proton from the abundant NH₃ solvent. The final product has no deuterium. This product is **aniline**.\n        *   **Deuteronation by NH₂D:** The carbanion could abstract a deuteron from the NH₂D present. This would place a deuterium atom on the ring ortho to the -NH₂ group. This product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n\n4.  **Final Tally of Unique Products:**\n    Let's list all the distinct organic molecules produced from all possible pathways:\n    1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A and Pathway B)\n    2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n    3.  **Aniline** (non-deuterated, from Pathway B)\n\n    Combining the products from both the major and minor pathways, we find a total of three unique organic products.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
