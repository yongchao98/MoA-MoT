    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, [CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to give the final neutral product.\n*   **Product Structure:**\n    *   Donor fragment: -CH(COOCH₃)₂\n    *   Acceptor fragment: p-tolyl-CH-CH₂-COOCH₃\n    *   Combined Product: p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃\n*   **Product Name Analysis:** Let's analyze the name given in the correct option, `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. This name describes the product based on a conceptual three-carbon chain:\n    *   **Position 1:** The carbon from the malonate, CH(COOCH₃)₂. It carries two methyl carboxylate groups.\n    *   **Position 2:** The β-carbon from the acrylate, which is bonded to the p-tolyl group.\n    *   **Position 3:** The α-carbon from the acrylate, which is part of the -CH₂-COOCH₃ group.\n    *   Assembling these pieces according to the name gives the structure `(MeOOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂COOMe`, which is identical to the structure we derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n### **Reaction B Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which functions as a Michael addition.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the C-2 of the cyclohexene ring (the α-carbon relative to the original ketone).\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    2.  An intermediate iminium ion is formed.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone) and protonates the nitrile intermediate.\n*   **Product Structure:**\n    *   The original enamine becomes cyclohexanone.\n    *   A new bond is formed between the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone (C-2) and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The nitrile fragment becomes -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: a cyclohexanone ring with a -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN group attached at the C-2 position.\n*   **Product Name Analysis:** The name for this structure is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n    *   **Parent chain:** Butanenitrile (a four-carbon chain with a nitrile group at C-1).\n    *   **Structure:** N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H-C(4)H₃\n    *   **Substituent:** A `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group is attached to C-3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   This name perfectly describes the derived product structure. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is less stable and not the major product for a simple ketone under these conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction C Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the Michael donor.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃.\n*   **Retrosynthetic Analysis (working backward from the product):**\n    1.  Identify the portion of the product that came from the Michael acceptor (MVK). The `3-oxobutyl` group, -CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃, corresponds to the MVK molecule after it has accepted the nucleophile.\n    2.  The new C-C bond in the product is between the `3-oxobutyl` group and C-2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n    3.  This means the nucleophile was the enolate of the molecule that provided the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` framework.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile C):** The protons on the carbon at position 2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are flanked by two carbonyl groups, making them highly acidic (pKa ≈ 5). The base (KOH) easily deprotonates this carbon to form a stable enolate. This enolate then acts as the nucleophile.\n*   Therefore, the starting reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
