    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The system consists of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n\n2.  **Total Number of States:** Since there are 3 spins and each has 2 possible values, the total number of possible configurations (or states) of the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\n3.  **Energy of the System:** The energy of a given state is defined by the formula:\n    E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n    where J is a constant.\n\n4.  **Partition Function (Z):** The partition function is a fundamental quantity in statistical mechanics that encodes the statistical properties of a system in thermal equilibrium. It is defined as the sum over all possible states (i) of the Boltzmann factor:\n    Z = Σ_i exp(-E_i / (k*T))\n    where E_i is the energy of the i-th state, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n    Using the given substitution β = 1/(k*T), the formula becomes:\n    Z = Σ_i exp(-β * E_i)\n\n5.  **Calculate Energy for Each State:** We need to list all 8 possible states and calculate the energy for each one. Let's denote a state by (S1, S2, S3).\n\n    *   **State 1: All spins up (+1, +1, +1)**\n        S1=1, S2=1, S3=1\n        E = -J[ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n    *   **State 2: All spins down (-1, -1, -1)**\n        S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n        E = -J[ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n    *   **State 3: Two spins up, one spin down.** There are three such configurations:\n        a) (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        b) (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[ (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        c) (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[ (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        All three states have the same energy, E = J.\n\n    *   **State 4: One spin up, two spins down.** There are three such configurations:\n        a) (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[ (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        b) (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[ (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        c) (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        All three states also have the same energy, E = J.\n\n6.  **Summarize Energies and Degeneracies:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of states that have that energy.\n    *   Energy E₁ = -3J has a degeneracy g₁ = 2 (from the all up and all down states).\n    *   Energy E₂ = J has a degeneracy g₂ = 3 + 3 = 6 (from the mixed spin states).\n    *   The total number of states is g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8, which is correct.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Partition Function:** Now we can write the partition function by summing the Boltzmann factors for each distinct energy level, multiplied by its degeneracy.\n    Z = g₁ * exp(-β * E₁) + g₂ * exp(-β * E₂)\n    Z = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * (J))\n    Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ). Let's compare this with the given options:\n    A) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n    B) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n    C) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n    D) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\n    Our result matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
