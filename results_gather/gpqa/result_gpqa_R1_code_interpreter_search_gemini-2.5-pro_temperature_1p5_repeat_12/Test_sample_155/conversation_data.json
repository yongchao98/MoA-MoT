    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the chromatographic analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. The addition of the oxygen atom to the double bond is a **syn-addition**. When a trans-alkene undergoes syn-addition, it forms a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides. In this case, it produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the oxygen bridge. This is an **anti-attack**, which inverts the stereochemistry at the carbon being attacked.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction, epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, is an **anti-dihydroxylation**. A general rule in stereochemistry is that the anti-addition to a trans-alkene results in a **meso** compound.\n    *   Let's trace it:\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺ → Water attacks at C4 (inverting it to S) or C5 (inverting it to S). Both attacks lead to the same product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, which is a meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺ → Water attacks at C4 (inverting it to R) or C5 (inverting it to R). Both attacks also lead to the same meso product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺), meaning this is also an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The anti-addition to a cis-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's trace it:\n        *   First, the syn-addition (epoxidation) to the cis-alkene forms a single meso epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Then, the anti-attack (hydrolysis) on this meso epoxide occurs:\n            *   Attack at the C4 (R-center) inverts its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack at the C5 (S-center) inverts its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The products are a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these isomers:\n*   Compound 2 and Compound 3 are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   Compound 1 is a **diastereomer** of Compound 2 (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n*   Compound 1 is also a **diastereomer** of Compound 3.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n*   Standard HPLC columns are achiral. They separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity and size.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like compounds 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like compound 1 and the pair 2/3) have different physical properties. They will interact differently with the stationary phase and will be separated into **different peaks**.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show two peaks: one for the meso compound and a second for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Total Peaks = 2.**\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer.\n*   **Enantiomers** will have different affinities for the chiral stationary phase and will be separated into **two distinct peaks**. So, compound 2 and compound 3 will be resolved.\n*   The **meso compound** (compound 1) is a diastereomer to both enantiomers and will also have a different retention time. It will appear as its own separate peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers.\n*   **Total Peaks = 3.**\n\n### Final Conclusion\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
