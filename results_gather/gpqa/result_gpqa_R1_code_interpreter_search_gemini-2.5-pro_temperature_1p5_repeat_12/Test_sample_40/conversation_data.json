    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the laboratory frame be the stationary frame, denoted as **S**. The observer is in this frame.\n    *   Let the frame of the moving glass be the moving frame, denoted as **S'**. This frame is moving with a constant velocity `v` relative to the lab frame S.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass frame (S') relative to the lab frame (S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light *within* the glass is determined by its index of refraction, `n`. In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of light is `u' = c/n`.\n    *   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum, `c`, should be taken as `1`. Therefore, the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   The question asks for the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory. This is the velocity of the light beam in frame S, which we will call `u`.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Principle:**\n    Since the problem involves the speed of light, we must use the principles of Special Relativity, specifically the formula for the relativistic addition of velocities. The simple Galilean addition of velocities (`u = u' + v`) is not accurate at speeds approaching the speed of light.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We have the following values:\n    *   `u'` (speed of light in the glass frame S') = `1/n`\n    *   `v` (speed of the glass frame S' relative to the lab frame S) = `v`\n    *   `c` (speed of light in vacuum) = `1`\n\n    Substitute these into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated speed `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option D.\n\n*   A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n*   B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n*   C) 1\n*   D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
